authorize the   HB4233- 5 -LRB099 12940 NHT 36800 b
1superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant
2principal, or dean of students of any
school to suspend a 3student for a period not to exceed
10 school days or may expel 4a student for a definite period of time not to

3left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 4the assistance
of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 5conducting inspections and
searches of lockers, desks, parking 6lots, and other school property and

13such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 14disciplinary action may
be taken. School authorities may also 15turn over such evidence to law
enforcement authorities. The 16provisions of this subsection (e) apply in all
school 17districts, including special charter districts and districts 18organized

in this or any other state, the 25student must complete the entire term of
