# Enable single sign-on for tab applications

Microsoft Teams provides a mechanism by which an application can obtain the signed-in Teams user token to access Microsoft Graph (and other APIs). Teams Toolkit facilitates this interaction by abstracting some of the Microsoft Entra flows and integrations behind some simple, high level APIs. This enables you to add single sign-on (SSO) features easily to your Teams application.

# Changes to your project

When you added the SSO feature to your application, Teams Toolkit updated your project to support SSO:

After you successfully added SSO into your project, Teams Toolkit will create and modify some files that helps you implement SSO feature.

| Action | File | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Create| `aad.template.json` under `templates/appPackage` | The Microsoft Entra application manifest that is used to register the application with Microsoft Entra. |
| Modify | `manifest.template.json` under `templates/appPackage` | An `webApplicationInfo` object will be added into your Teams app manifest template. This field is required by Teams when enabling SSO. |
| Create | `auth/tab` | Reference code, redirect pages and a `README.md` file. These files are provided for reference. See below for more information. |

# Update your code to add SSO

As described above, the Teams Toolkit generated some configuration to set up your application for SSO, but you need to update your application business logic to take advantage of the SSO feature as appropriate.

1. Move `auth-start.html` and `auth-end.html` in `auth/tab/public` folder to `tabs/public/`.
These two HTML files are used for auth redirects.

1. Move `sso` folder under `auth/tab` to `tabs/src/sso/`.

    `InitTeamsFx`: This file implements a function that initialize TeamsFx SDK and will open `GetUserProfile` component after SDK is initialized.

    `GetUserProfile`: This file implements a function that calls Microsoft Graph API to get user info.

2. Add the following lines to `tabs/src/components/sample/Welcome.*` to import `InitTeamsFx`:
    ```
    import { InitTeamsFx } from "../../sso/InitTeamsFx";
    ```
3. Replace the following line: `<AddSSO />` with `<InitTeamsFx />` to replace the `AddSSO` component with `InitTeamsFx` component.

# Debug your application

You can debug your application by pressing F5.

Teams Toolkit will use the Microsoft Entra manifest file to register a Microsoft Entra application registered for SSO.

# Customize Microsoft Entra applications

The Microsoft Entra [manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest) allows you to customize various aspects of your application registration. You can update the manifest as needed.

Follow this [document](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-aad-manifest#how-to-customize-the-aad-manifest-template) if you need to include additional API permissions to access your desired APIs.
