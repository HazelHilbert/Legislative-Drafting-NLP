Actions required - update your code to add SSO authentication
-------------------------

You need to update your application code to take advantage of the SSO authentication.

1. Move 'GetUserProfile.razor' file from 'Auth/tab' folder to 'Components/' folder.
   - 'GetUserProfile': This file implements a function that uses TeamsFx SDK to call Microsoft Graph API to get user info.
2. Rplace the 'AddSSO' component with 'GetUserProfile' component. To do this, just replace the following line: '<AddSSO />' with '<GetUserProfile />' in 'Components/Welcome.razor' file.

Teams Toolkit will use the Microsoft Entra manifest file to register a Microsoft Entra application registered for SSO.
