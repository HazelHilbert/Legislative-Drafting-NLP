											  Waste discharge requirements: produced water: oil and gas operations.</span></div><div><span id="digesttext"><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State Water Resources Control Board and the California regional water quality control boards are the principal agencies with authority over water quality. Under the act, persons discharging waste are required to file with the appropriate regional board a report of the discharge and the discharge is subject to waste discharge requirements prescribed by that regional board.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require the state board to conduct a public hearing, as specified, to determine whether using produced water from an oil and gas operation for specified water uses would pose a hazard to the public, employees that regularly interact with the produced water, or the environment. The bill would require the state board, if it determines that using the produced water for a particular use would not pose a hazard
		and would be safe for the public, employees that regularly interact with the produced water, and the environment, to make a finding to that effect. The bill would permit a regional water quality control board to issue a waste discharge requirement for any of the specified water uses only if the state board determines that using produced water for that particular use would not pose a hazard and would be safe for the public, employees that regularly interact with the produced water, and the environment. </div></span></div><span class="hidden"><h2>Digest Key</h2></span><span id="vote">
