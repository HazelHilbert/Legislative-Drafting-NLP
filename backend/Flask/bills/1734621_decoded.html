											  California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act: market development payments.</span></div><div><span id="digesttext"><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Existing law, the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act, requires a distributor to pay a redemption payment for every beverage container sold or offered for sale in the state by the distributor to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery for deposit in the California Beverage Container Recycling Fund. Moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the department for certain payments, including, until January 1, 2018, market development payments. Former law authorized the department, until January 1, 2018, (1) to annually expend up to $10,000,000 from the fund to make market development payments to an entity certified by the department as a recycling center, processor, or dropoff or collection program for empty plastic beverage containers that are subsequently washed and processed into flake, pellet, or other form, and made usable for the
		manufacture of a plastic product, or to a product manufacturer for empty plastic beverage containers that are subsequently washed and processed into flake, pellet, or other form, and used by that product manufacturer to manufacture a product, and (2) to expend additional amounts to make market development payments, calculated as provided.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would authorize the department to again expend those amounts to make market development payments until January 1, 2024. By authorizing expenditures from a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.</div></span></div><span class="hidden"><h2>Digest Key</h2></span><span id="vote">
