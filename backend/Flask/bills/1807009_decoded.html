			 school districts, and community college districts, for the prior fiscal year for purposes of the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would revise and recast those provisions, and provide specified procedures, including timelines, for the calculation, recalculation, and certification of the state’s minimum funding obligation to school districts and community college districts required by the California Constitution. The bill would provide specified timelines for comment and judicial challenge of the Director of Finance’s final certification of the state’s minimum funding obligation made pursuant to these provisions. The bill would establish the Proposition 98 Cost Allocation Schedule, to be utilized by the Director of Finance to account for Proposition 98 appropriations in excess of the amounts required to satisfy the minimum funding obligation
			 to school districts and community college districts. The bill would authorize the Director of Finance to credit any amounts attributable to the Proposition 98 Cost Allocation Schedule to satisfy the minimum funding obligation to school districts and community college districts pursuant to the California Constitution for any prior fiscal year. If, after crediting all amounts attributable to the Proposition 98 Cost Allocation Schedule, there remains an outstanding balance in the minimum funding obligation to school districts and community college districts, the bill would appropriate the amounts necessary to satisfy the minimum funding obligation from the General Fund to the Controller, without regard to fiscal years, for allocation to school districts and community college districts, as specified.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) Existing law establishes a public school financing system that requires state funding for county superintendents of schools, school districts, and
			 charter schools to be calculated pursuant to a local control funding formula, as specified. Existing law requires, for the 2013–14 fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, the Superintendent of Public Instruction to annually calculate a county local control funding formula for each county superintendent of schools, as provided.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Existing law requires the Superintendent to make certain computations for purposes of computing the amount of funding for necessary small high schools, as defined. Existing law requires the Superintendent to add a specified amount to the county local control funding formula for purposes of necessary small high schools.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Existing law also requires, commencing with the 2013–14 fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, the Superintendent to calculate a base entitlement for the transition to the county local control funding formula for each county superintendent of schools, as provided.
			 Existing law requires the amount of the base entitlement to be increased by a specified adjustment.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would repeal the requirement that the Superintendent add the specified amount to the county local control funding formula for purposes of necessary small high schools, and would repeal the requirement that the amount of the base entitlement for the transition to the county local control funding formula for each county superintendent of schools be increased by the specified adjustment.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(3) Existing law provides specified cost-of-living adjustments to the amounts calculated pursuant to the local control funding formula and for necessary small schools. Existing law, upon full implementation of the local control funding formula, requires that those cost-of-living adjustments be made only if an appropriation for that purpose is included in the annual Budget Act.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would repeal the requirement that, upon full implementation of the local control funding formula, those cost-of-living adjustments be made only if an appropriation for that purpose is included in the annual Budget Act.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(4) Existing law requires the Controller to transfer from the General Fund to Section A of the State School Fund during each fiscal year the amount of moneys required to meet the amounts apportioned pursuant to specified provisions of the local control funding formula, upon certification by the Superintendent of Public Instruction of that amount.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill instead would continuously appropriate from the General Fund to Section A of the State School Fund for allocation by the Controller any amounts necessary to meet the requirements of specified programs during each fiscal year, including, among others, the local control funding formula,
			 the basic aid school district block grant, and the Open Enrollment Act, upon certification by the Superintendent of those amounts. By establishing a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(5) Existing law specifies that funds appropriated for the Child Care and Development Services Act do not apply toward the constitutional minimum funding obligation for school districts and community college districts, with the exception of state funding for the part-day California state preschool programs and the After School Education and Safety Program.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would additionally count toward the constitutional minimum funding obligation for school districts and community college districts state funding to specified local educational agencies to create a full day of care for children participating in the California state preschool program.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(6) This bill would appropriate $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Controller in the 2018–19 fiscal year for allocation to school districts and community college districts for the purpose of reducing the 2009–10 fiscal year outstanding balance of the minimum funding obligation to school districts and community college districts, as specified.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(7) This bill would provide that any judicial action or proceeding to challenge, review, set aside, void, or annul the provisions of the bill, or any portion of the bill, may proceed only by application or complaint filed within 45 days of the effective date of the bill. </div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(8) This bill would provide that if any section or part of the bill is for any reason held unconstitutional, unenforceable, or otherwise invalid, the entire act shall become inoperative.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(9) This bill would correct cross-references and make other nonsubstantive changes.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(10) Funds appropriated by this bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(11)This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.</div></i></font><font color="RED"><strike><p style="display:inline;"><strike>This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2018.</strike></p><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;"></div></strike></font></span></div><span class="hidden"><h2>Digest Key</h2></span><span id="vote">

						the state, providing the largest increases to school districts serving our neediest pupils.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(c) Now that the transition to the local control funding formula is complete, it is time to enhance the certainty of Proposition 98 by ensuring local control funding formula funds flow to school districts without delay.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(d) The act adding this section furthers the purposes of Proposition 98 through enactment of a continuous appropriation for local control funding formula funding that is automatically adjusted for increases in the cost of living and changes in enrollment to provide the funding guaranteed to school districts under the California Constitution.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(e) With enactment of a continuous appropriation comes a heightened need to know with certainty the amount of funding that is required to be provided to school districts
						under the California Constitution.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(f) While prior law created a mechanism to certify the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee to provide certainty and to allocate owed funds to schools in a timely manner, the mechanism was unenforceable and rarely implemented.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;"> (g) The Proposition 98 minimum guarantee was last certified in the 2008–09 fiscal year by statute. Outstanding issues, including when a maintenance factor is created, how the maintenance factor is repaid, the impact on the guarantee of funding and revenue changes, as well as which programs can be funded with Proposition 98 funds, have delayed certification of the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee. These delays in certification create uncertainty, lead to questions regarding the level of funding required for certain years, and can lead to delays in payment of settle-up funds. Notwithstanding the significance of
						outstanding issues, school districts and the state need to know with certainty the total amount of funding to which they are entitled and the state’s plan for providing all of that funding.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(h) Section 41207.31 certifies the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee for the 2009–10 to 2015–16, inclusive, fiscal years based on final school enrollment, personal income, and revenue data. Section 41206.01 replaces the existing certification process, with a new transparent, mandatory process to certify the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee and provide settle-up funds on a timely basis commencing with the 2016–17 fiscal year minimum guarantee.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(i) Section 41206.01 is in addition to existing law that provides for calculation and recalculation of the minimum funding obligation to school districts under Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution, as well as provisions in current law
