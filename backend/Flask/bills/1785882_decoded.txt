departments, institutions, 13and bodies politic and all other administrative
units or 14outgrowths of the executive branch of State government except 15the
Constitutional officers, the State Board of Education and 16the State

existing State-owned and 20State-leased property
to make a determination of need.
21 The leases shall be for
a term not to exceed 5 years, 22except that the leases
may contain a renewal clause subject to 23acceptance by the State after
that date or an option to   SB3143 Engrossed- 2 -LRB100 16660 HLH 33717 b
1purchase. The purchases shall be made
through
contracts that 2(i) may provide for the title to the property to
transfer
3immediately to the State or a trustee or nominee for the 4benefit of the
State, (ii) shall provide for the consideration 5to be
paid in installments to
be made at stated intervals 6during a certain term not to exceed 30 years
from the date of 7the contract, and (iii) may provide for the
payment of interest 8on the unpaid balance at a rate that does not exceed
a rate 9determined by adding 3 percentage points to the annual yield on
10United States Treasury
obligations of comparable maturity as 11most recently published in the Wall
Street Journal at the time 12such contract is signed. The leases and
purchase
contracts 13shall be and shall recite
that they are subject to termination 14and cancellation in any year for which
the General Assembly 15fails to make an appropriation to pay the rent or
purchase 16installments payable
under the terms of the lease or purchase 17contract.
Additionally, the purchase contract shall specify 18that title to
the office
and storage space, buildings, land, 19and other facilities being acquired

failure
of the General 21Assembly to appropriate suitable funds.
However, this 22limitation on the
term of the leases does not apply to leases 23to and with the

for which the General Assembly fails 2to make an appropriation to pay the

not
apply if the lease 4or purchase contract contains a provision
limiting the 5liability for
the payment of the rentals or installments 6thereof solely to funds
received from the Federal government.

13 (f) On and after September 17, 1983, the powers granted to
14the Department under this Section shall be exercised 15exclusively by the

space,
and other criteria as he or she shall   SB3143 Engrossed- 5 -LRB100 16660 HLH 33717 b

purchase will
16 meet a permanent space need;

17   (B) the building or facilities will be 18 substantially occupied by State
agencies
after 19 purchase (or after acceptance in the case of a build to 20 suit);

acceptable to the State, to 6 address the known environmental
hazard;

7   (F) the building, land, or facilities satisfy 8 applicable
accessibility
and applicable building 9 codes; and

10   (G) the State's cost to lease purchase or 11 installment purchase the
building,
land, or facilities 12 is less than the cost to lease space of comparable
13 quality, size, and location over the lease purchase or 14 installment purchase
term.

15  (2) The Department shall establish the methodology for 16 comparing lease
costs to
the costs of installment or lease 17 purchases. The cost comparison shall take
into account all
18 relevant cost factors, including, but not limited to, debt 19 service,
operating
and maintenance costs,
insurance and 20 risk costs, real estate taxes, reserves for replacement and
21 repairs, security costs,
and utilities. The methodology 22 shall also provide:

23   (A) that the comparison will be made using level 24 payment plans; and

25   (B) that a purchase price must not exceed the fair 26 market value of the
buildings, land, or facilities and   SB3143 Engrossed- 7 -LRB100 16660 HLH 33717 b
1 that the purchase price
must be substantiated by
an 2 appraisal or by a competitive selection process.

3  (3) If the Department intends to enter into an 4 installment purchase or
lease purchase agreement for 5 buildings, land, or facilities under circumstances
that do 6 not satisfy the conditions specified by this Section, it 7 must issue a
notice to the Secretary of the Senate and the 8 Clerk of the House. The notice
shall contain (i) specific 9 details of the State's proposed purchase, including
the 10 amounts, purposes, and financing terms; (ii) a specific 11 description of how
the proposed purchase varies from the 12 procedures set forth in this Section; and
(iii) a specific 13 justification, signed by the Director, stating why
it is in 14 the
State's best interests to proceed with the purchase. 15 The Department may not
proceed with such an installment 16 purchase or lease purchase agreement if,
within 60 calendar 17 days after delivery of the notice, the General Assembly, by
18 joint resolution, disapproves the transaction. Delivery 19 may take place on a
day and at an hour when the Senate and 20 House are not in session so long as the
offices of 21 Secretary and Clerk are open to receive the notice. In 22 determining
the 60-day period within which the General 23 Assembly must act,
the day on which
delivery is made to the 24 Senate and House shall not be counted. If delivery of
the 25 notice to the 2 houses occurs on different days, the 60-day
26 period shall begin on the day following the later delivery.

  SB3143 Engrossed- 8 -LRB100 16660 HLH 33717 b

report 7 shall include a summary statement of the aggregate amount 8 of the State's
obligations under those purchases; specific 9 details pertaining to
each purchase,
including the 10 amounts, purposes, and financing terms and payment 11 schedule
for each
purchase; and any other matter that the 12 Department deems advisable. The report shall also contain 13 an analysis of all leases that meet both of the following 14 criteria: (1) the lease contains a purchase option clause; 15 and (2) the third full year of the lease has been 16 completed. That analysis shall include, without 17 limitation, a recommendation of whether it is in the 18 State's best interest to exercise the purchase option or to 19 seek to renew the lease without exercising the clause. 

20  The requirement for reporting to the General Assembly 21 shall be satisfied by
filing copies of the report with the 22 Auditor General, the Speaker, the Minority
Leader, and the 23 Clerk of the House of Representatives and the President,
24 the
Minority Leader,
and the Secretary of the Senate, the 25 Chairs of the Appropriations Committees,
and the 26 Legislative Research Unit, as required
by Section 3.1 of   SB3143 Engrossed- 9 -LRB100 16660 HLH 33717 b
