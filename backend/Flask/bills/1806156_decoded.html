Existing law provides for the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program, under which, through a combination of state and county funds and federal funds received through the TANF program, each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families. Existing law generally requires a recipient of CalWORKs benefits to participate in welfare-to-work activities as a condition of eligibility for aid. Existing federal law also provides for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known in California as CalFresh, under which supplemental nutrition assistance benefits allocated to the state by the federal government are
			 distributed to eligible individuals by each county. Under existing law, the State Department of Social Services is charged with state administration of both of these programs.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Existing law generally prohibits county welfare departments and the State Department of Social Services from disclosing records and information concerning the administration of public social services for which grants-in-aid are received from the United States government, such as CalWORKs and CalFresh, and requires that those records and information be kept confidential, except as prescribed.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Existing law establishes the Employment First Policy, which is the policy that opportunities for integrated, competitive employment be given the highest priority for working-age individuals with developmental disabilities, regardless of the severity of their disabilities. Existing law requires various state agencies to disclose specified information to the State
			 Department of Developmental Services to assist the department in the implementation of this policy.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would, notwithstanding the general prohibition above, require the State Department of Social Services to<font color="RED"><strike> disclose</strike></font><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i> provide the</i></font> eligibility and enrollment data for the<font color="RED"><strike> CalWORKs and CalFresh</strike></font><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i> CalWORKs, CalFresh, and Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment</i></font> programs to the State Department of Developmental Services<font color="RED"><strike> to assist that department in the implementation</strike></font><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i>
