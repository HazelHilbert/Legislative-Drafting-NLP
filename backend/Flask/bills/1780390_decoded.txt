STATEMENT
 
     This bill makes a General Fund
supplemental appropriation of $50,000 to the Department of Military and
Veterans' Affairs for the purpose of having air quality studies conducted to
support the efforts to advance New Jersey's candidacy in obtaining the federal
award for the F-35 fighter jet at the 177th Air National Guard base. 
The United States Air Force is in the process of selecting air bases as
potential locations for the deployment of new fighter jets, F-35 Joint Strike
Fighters.  By appropriating the funding for air quality studies, the State is
supporting efforts to advance New Jersey's candidacy in obtaining the F-35
fighter jets.  Assembly Resolution No. 149 of 2016 and Senate Resolution No. 55
of 2016, both filed with the Secretary of State, urged the United States Air Force
to base the F-35 fighter jets at the 177th Air National Guard base.
