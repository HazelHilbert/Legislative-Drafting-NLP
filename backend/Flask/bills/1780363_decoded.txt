Upon completion of the investigation, the commissioner shall prepare written findings that shall include recommended actions. Not later than forty-five days after completion of the investigation, the commissioner shall disclose, in general terms, the result of the investigation to the person or persons who reported the suspected abuse, provided: (A) The person who made such report is legally mandated to make such report, (B) the information is not otherwise privileged or confidential under state or federal law, (C) the names of the witnesses or other persons interviewed are kept confidential, and (D) the names of the person or persons suspected to be responsible for the abuse are not disclosed unless such person or persons have been arrested as a result of the investigation.
