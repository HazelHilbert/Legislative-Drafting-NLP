service preference to military servicemembers who served in Operations Provide
Comfort and Provide Comfort II, created in response to Kurds fleeing Saddam
Hussein's oppressive regime.&nbsp; The Provide Comfort operations were part of a
humanitarian mission of the United States in conjunction with many other
countries to provide Kurdish refugees with relief supplies, to enforce a
security zone to protect the Kurds on the ground, and to enforce a no-fly zone
over northern Iraq.&nbsp; Although these operations may not be as widely recognized
as more traditional missions, at the time, the mission was the largest
humanitarian effort in history and it saved the lives of thousands of people. </p>
