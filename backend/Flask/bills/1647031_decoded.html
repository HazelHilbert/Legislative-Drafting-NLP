											  DNA evidence.</span></div><div><span id="digesttext"><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Existing law establishes the Sexual Assault Victims’ DNA Bill of Rights, which, among other things, encourages a law enforcement agency assigned to investigate specified sexual assault offenses to perform DNA testing of rape kit evidence or other crime scene evidence in a timely manner to ensure the longest possible statute of limitations. Existing law also requires a law enforcement agency to inform victims of certain unsolved sexual assault offenses if the law enforcement agency elects not to analyze DNA evidence within certain time limits.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require law enforcement agencies to report information regarding rape kit evidence, within 120 days of the collection of the kit, to the Department of Justice through a database established by the department. The bill would require that information to include, among other things, the
			 number of kits collected, if biological evidence samples were submitted to a DNA laboratory for analysis, and if a probative DNA profile was generated. The bill would additionally require a public DNA laboratory, or a law enforcement agency contracting with a private laboratory, to provide a reason for not testing a sample every 120 days the sample is untested, except as specified. The bill would only impose these requirements for a kit collected on or after January 1, 2018. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.<font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i> The bill would require that money received by the Office of Emergency Services from the federal Office on Violence Against Women be used before appropriating money from the General Fund for purposes of reimbursing any costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates to be mandated by the state to a local law enforcement agency by the bill.</i></font></div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;"> This bill would require the department to file a report to the Legislature on an annual basis summarizing the information in its database.

Currently, there is no mandatory statewide tracking mechanism to collect and report these metrics. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section, pursuant to recommendations by the California State Auditor to the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, to correct that.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(b) In 2015, the Department of Justice created the
