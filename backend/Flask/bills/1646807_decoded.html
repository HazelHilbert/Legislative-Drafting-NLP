										Horse Racing Law.</span></div><div><span id="digesttext"><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Existing law, the Horse Racing Law, generally regulates horse racing and vests the administration and enforcement of the Horse Racing Law in the California Horse Racing Board. Existing law, until January 1, 2018, requires any racing association, including a fair, that conducts thoroughbred racing to pay to the owners’ organization contracting with the association with respect to the conduct of thoroughbred racing an additional 1<font size="2"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></font>% of the portion required to be deducted for purses for a national marketing program, as specified.
