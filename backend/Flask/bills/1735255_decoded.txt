							No. 2828Introduced by Assembly Member FriedmanFebruary 16, 2018 An act to amend Section 13263 of, and to add Section 13167.8 to, the Water Code, relating to water quality. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 2828, as introduced, Friedman.
											  Waste discharge requirements: produced water: oil and gas operations.Under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State Water Resources Control Board and the California regional water quality control boards are the principal agencies with authority over water quality. Under the act, persons discharging waste are required to file with the appropriate regional board a report of the discharge and the discharge is subject to waste discharge requirements prescribed by that regional board.This bill would require the state board to conduct a public hearing, as specified, to determine whether using produced water from an oil and gas operation for specified water uses would pose a hazard to the public, employees that regularly interact with the produced water, or the environment. The bill would require the state board, if it determines that using the produced water for a particular use would not pose a hazard
		and would be safe for the public, employees that regularly interact with the produced water, and the environment, to make a finding to that effect. The bill would permit a regional water quality control board to issue a waste discharge requirement for any of the specified water uses only if the state board determines that using produced water for that particular use would not pose a hazard and would be safe for the public, employees that regularly interact with the produced water, and the environment.

				  to that effect.(2) A regional water quality control board may issue a waste discharge requirement for a use described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) only if the state board determines, pursuant to paragraph (1), that using produced water for that particular use would not pose a hazard and would be safe for the public, employees that regularly interact with the produced water, and the environment.(c) For purposes of this section, “produced water” means produced water from an oil and gas operation, including wastewater and wastewater that has been treated and “wastewater” includes, but is not limited to, flowback, drilling muds and cuttings, and any other discharge that a regional water quality control board has determined is subject to waste discharge requirements. SEC. 2. Section 13263 of the Water Code is amended to read:13263. (a) The Except as provided in Section 13167.8, the regional board, after any necessary hearing, shall prescribe requirements as to the nature of any proposed discharge, existing discharge, or material change in an existing discharge, except discharges into a community sewer system, with relation to the conditions existing in the disposal area or receiving waters upon, or into which, the discharge is made or proposed. The requirements shall implement any relevant water quality control plans that have been adopted, and shall take into consideration the beneficial uses to be protected, the water quality
				  objectives reasonably required for that purpose, other waste discharges, the need to prevent nuisance, and the provisions of Section 13241.(b) A regional board, in prescribing requirements, need not authorize the utilization of the full waste assimilation capacities of the receiving waters.(c) The requirements may contain a time schedule, subject to revision in the discretion of the regional board.(d) The regional board may prescribe requirements although no discharge report has been filed.(e) Upon application by any affected person, or on its own motion, the regional board may review and revise requirements.

After receipt of the notice, the person so notified shall provide adequate means to meet the requirements.(g) No discharge of waste into the waters of the state, whether or not the discharge is made pursuant to waste discharge requirements, shall create a vested right to continue the discharge. All discharges of waste into waters of the state are privileges, not rights.(h) The regional board may incorporate the requirements prescribed pursuant to this section into a master recycling permit for either a supplier or distributor, or both, of recycled water.(i) The state board or a regional board may prescribe general waste discharge requirements for a category of discharges if the state board or that regional board finds or determines that all of the following criteria apply to the discharges in that category:(1) The discharges are produced by the same or similar operations.(2) The discharges involve the same or similar types of waste.(3) The discharges require the same or similar treatment standards.(4) The discharges are more appropriately regulated under general discharge requirements than individual discharge requirements.(j) The state board, after any necessary hearing,
