										Local Government Omnibus Act of 2017.</span></div><div><span id="digesttext"><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(1) The California Constitution requires, among others, all public officers to take a specified oath of office. Existing statutory law requires any officer to take that oath before he or she enters the duties of his or her office.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require an officer to take that oath following any election or appointment and before entering the duties of his or her office.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) Existing law requires all sums paid by the Controller for the postponement of property taxes be secured by a lien in favor of the state. In the case of a lien on real property for this purpose, existing law requires, among other things, the recorder for the county in which the real property is subject to the lien to provide a copy of the notice of lien to the county tax collector.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would instead require the Controller to provide a copy of the notice of lien to the county tax collector and would additionally require a copy of the notice of lien to be provided to the county assessor.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(3) Existing law establishes a formula for calculating the interest on a payment made by the Controller for postponed property taxes from the time a payment is made. Under existing law, for purposes of this provision, a payment is deemed to be made at the time an electronic funds transfer is made by the Controller to the tax collector or the delinquency date of the respective tax installment, whichever is later. Existing law, in the event of willful neglect, authorizes an electronic funds transfer for that current fiscal year to be used to pay delinquent taxes only if accompanied by sufficient amounts to pay all of the delinquent penalties, costs, fees, and interest. Existing law, if a denial of
		a claim for postponement is reversed on appeal, requires the Controller to electronically transfer funds to the county.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would instead deem a payment to be made at the time a payment is made by the Controller to the tax collector or the delinquency date of the respective tax installment, whichever is later. The bill would instead authorize a payment from the Controller to be used to pay delinquent taxes under the circumstances described above. The bill would eliminate the requirement that funds be transferred electronically if a denial of a claim for postponement is reversed on appeal. The bill would also make various conforming changes.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(4) Existing law requires the Controller to reduce the amount of the obligation secured by the lien against the real property by the amount of any payments received for that purpose and by specified amounts paid by the Franchise Tax Board or by certain other
		authorized amounts.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require that payments received for the reduction of the obligation be applied first to any interest due on the loan, 2nd to the principal property tax amount, and finally, if there is any remaining balance, to administrative fees.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(5) Existing law authorizes recordation of certain documents, including a release, discharge, or subordination of a lien for postponed property taxes, without acknowledgment, certificate of acknowledgment, or further proof.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would delete the reference to the subordination of a lien for postponed property taxes from the list of documents that may be recorded without acknowledgment, certificate of acknowledgment, or further proof.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(6) Existing law authorizes the County of Merced, by a

The bill would make additional conforming changes. </div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(7) Existing law establishes the Committee on County Accounting Procedures which consists of 10 members appointed by the Controller. Of those 10 members, 5 of the members are required to be county auditors.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would instead require 5 of those
		members to be county auditors or county officers in equivalent positions.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(8) Existing law requires a local agency that provides any type of compensation, salary, or stipend to a local agency official of that agency to provide sexual harassment prevention training and education, as specified. Existing law requires an entity that develops curricular to satisfy these requirements to consult with the city attorney or county counsel regarding the sufficiency and accuracy of that proposed content, as specified.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would instead require the entity to consult with the legal counsel of that entity.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(9) Existing law requires the legislative body of a local agency, on or before December 31 of each year, to prepare an appointments list of all regular and ongoing boards, commissions, and committees which are appointed by the legislative body
		of the local agency known as the Local Appointments List. Existing law requires the list to be made available to members of the public, as specified, and requires the legislative body to designate the public library with the largest service population within its jurisdiction to receive a copy of the list.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would alternatively authorize the list to be posted on the local agency’s Internet Web site.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(10) Existing law requires notice of an unscheduled vacancy that occurs in any board, commission, or committee for which the legislative body of a local agency has the appointing power to be posted in the office of the clerk of the local agency, a designated public library, and any other place as directed by the local agency.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would alternatively authorize the notice of an unscheduled vacancy to be posted on the local agency’s Internet Web site
		instead of being posted in the library.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(11) Existing law authorizes a public agency, in the case of an emergency and with a vote of <font size="2"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub></font> of the governing body, to repair or replace a public facility, take any directly related and immediate action required by that emergency, and procure the necessary equipment, services, and supplies for the purposes, without giving notice for bids to let contracts.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would correct inaccurate cross references and add two missing cross-references.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(12) Existing law, except as provided in the property tax postponement program, prohibits a certificate of eligibility from being used to pay any delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, costs, fees, or interest, or any redemption charges.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would eliminate that prohibition.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(13) Existing law, with respect to a claimant whose property taxes are paid by a lender from an impound, trust, or other specified type of account, requires the tax collector to notify the auditor of the claimant’s name and address, and the duplicate amount of money the Controller transferred to the tax collector via an electronic fund transfer. Existing law requires the county auditor, treasurer, or disbursing officer to send a check, in the amount of money based on the electronic transfer by the Controller, to the Controller within 60 days of the replicated payment.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill, upon receipt of the payment by the Controller, as specified, would require the tax collector to maintain a record of the fact that taxes on the property have been postponed and, with respect to a claimant described above, to notify the auditor
		of the claimant’s name and address, and the duplicate amount of money the Controller paid to the tax collector. The bill would instead require the county auditor, treasurer, or disbursing officer to refund the amount of money, based on the payment by the Controller, to the claimant within 60 days of the replicated payment.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(14) Existing law, upon receipt of a “notice of lien for postponed property taxes” from the Controller, requires the tax collector or the assessor, whichever is applicable, to immediately enter on the assessment records applicable to the property the fact that the taxes on the property have been postponed and the Controller’s identification number and to notify the Controller of a subsequent change in ownership status, as provided.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would instead require the assessor to maintain a record of the fact that the taxes on the property have been postponed and the Controller’s
		identification number and to notify the Controller as described above.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(15) Existing law requires, for purposes of the Gonsalves-Deukmejian-Petris Senior Citizens Property Tax Assistance Law, that all losses and nonexpenses be converted to zero for the purpose of determining whether the homeowner meets the property tax postponement requirement.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would instead require that all losses and nonexpenses be converted to zero, as specified above, for the purposes of property tax postponement.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(16) Existing law requires that a claimant for property tax postponement, generally, be an individual who is a member of the household, is either an owner-occupant, tenant stockholder occupant, or possessory interestholder occupant of the residential dwelling as to which postponement is claimed, and is either 62 years of age or older, blind, or
		disabled. With respect to blind and disabled claimants, existing law requires that the claimant be blind or disabled, as specified, at the time of application or on December 10 of the fiscal year for which postponement is claimed, whichever is earlier.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would instead require, for blind and disabled claimants, that the claimant be blind or disabled at the time of application or on February 10 of the fiscal year for which postponement is claimed.</div><font color="RED"><strike><p style="display:inline;"><strike>(17)<span class="EnSpace"/>Existing law requires that a claim for postponement of property taxes be for the residential dwelling, defined generally as the principal place of residence of the claimant and so much of the land surrounding it as is reasonably necessary for the use of the dwelling as a home that is owned by the claimant alone or by the claimant and other specified individuals.</strike></p><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;"></div><p style="display:inline;"><strike>Existing law authorizes an applicant,

When the Controller approves the Notice of Election to Postpone, existing law requires the Controller to make payments directly to the county tax collector.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would instead require the Controller to issue payment to the county tax collector or other appropriate payee, as determined by the Controller.</div><font color="RED"><strike><p style="display:inline;"><strike>(19)</strike></p><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;"></div></strike></font><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;"><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i>(18)</i></font> This bill would make various technical changes related to the property tax postponement program, including updating statutory references to the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Fund and deleting obsolete references to certificates of eligibility and postponement for mobilehomes.</div><font color="RED"><strike><p style="display:inline;"><strike>(20)</strike></p><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;"></div></strike></font><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;"><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i>(19)</i></font> Existing law establishes the North Fork Kings Groundwater Sustainability Agency and requires the agency to be governed by a 7-member board of directors.

The objects and purposes of this act are to provide for the collection and disposal of sewage and industrial waste and for the control and disposition of the storm and flood waters of the district, and to protect the public health and also to protect from damage from the storm and flood waters the waterways, property, public highways and public places in the district.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">The Legislature hereby declares that special facts and circumstances peculiar to the area within the district<font color="RED"><strike> makes</strike></font><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i> make</i></font> the accomplishment of the purposes of this act impossible under existing general

The state and the people thereof have a primary and supreme interest in securing to the inhabitants and property owners within the district adequate facilities for the collection and disposal of sewage and the protection from waters naturally flowing into the district from the surrounding mountainous watershed. Special investigation has shown that the conditions within the district are peculiar to that area and that this act is essential to carry out the purposes herein expressed and for the elimination of duplication of governmental authority and securing greater economy of administration. It is further found and determined that the area within the district has no facilities for the sanitary treatment and disposal of sewage and is consequently contaminating and polluting the waters of San Francisco Bay. The area within the district is of strategic importance due to the proximity of Mare Island Navy Yard. The influx of Navy personnel and their families and civilian
				  workers at the Mare Island Navy Yard has greatly aggravated the problem of sewage disposal in that area. The problem of sewage disposal is further aggravated by a lack of adequate drainage and<font color="RED"><strike> floodwater</strike></font><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i>
				  flood water</i></font> control and the infiltration of storm and flood waters into existing sanitary sewers. Both the problem of sanitary sewage and drainage and the problem of storm water flood control are so interrelated that the special problems relating to each can only be solved by uniform administration and a uniform control plan of sewage disposal and flood control works.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">The Vallejo<font color="RED"><strike> Sanitation and Flood Control</strike></font><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i> Flood and Wastewater</i></font> District is hereby declared to be a body corporate and politic and may do all of the following:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(a) Succession.
