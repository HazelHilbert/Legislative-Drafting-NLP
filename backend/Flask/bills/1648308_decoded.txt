Whereas, on the night of Friday, August 11, 2017, a day be-
fore a White nationalist demonstration was scheduled to occur in Charlottesville, Virginia, hundreds of torch-bear-ing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-im-migrant slogans and violently engaged with counter-dem-onstrators on and around the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville; 
Whereas, on Saturday, August 12, 2017, ahead of the sched-
uled start time of the planned march, protestors and 
2 
†SJ 49 ES counter-demonstrators gathered at Emancipation Park in 
Charlottesville; 
Whereas the extremist demonstration turned violent, culmi-
nating in the death of peaceful counter-demonstrator Heather Heyer and injuries to 19 other individuals after a neo-Nazi sympathizer allegedly drove a vehicle into a crowd, an act that resulted in a charge of second degree murder, 3 counts of malicious wounding, and 1 count of hit and run; 
Whereas 2 Virginia State Police officers, Lieutenant H. Jay 
Cullen and Trooper Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, died in a helicopter crash as they patrolled the events occurring below them; 
Whereas the Charlottesville community is engaged in a heal-
ing process following this horrific and violent display of bigotry; and 
Whereas White nationalists, White supremacists, the Ku 
Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in the United States and communities everywhere are concerned about the growing and open display of hate and violence being perpetrated by those groups: Now, therefore, be it
