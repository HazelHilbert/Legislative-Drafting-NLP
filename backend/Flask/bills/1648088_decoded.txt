LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTSB 205, Committee on Governance and Finance.
										Local Government Omnibus Act of 2017.(1) The California Constitution requires, among others, all public officers to take a specified oath of office. Existing statutory law requires any officer to take that oath before he or she enters the duties of his or her office.This bill would require an officer to take that oath following any election or appointment and before entering the duties of his or her office.(2) Existing law requires all sums paid by the Controller for the postponement of property taxes be secured by a lien in favor of the state. In the case of a lien on real property for this purpose, existing law requires, among other things, the recorder for the county in which the real property is subject to the lien to provide a copy of the notice of lien to the county tax collector.This bill would instead require the Controller to provide a copy of the notice of lien to the county tax collector and would additionally require a copy of the notice of lien to be provided to the county assessor.(3) Existing law establishes a formula for calculating the interest on a payment made by the Controller for postponed property taxes from the time a payment is made. Under existing law, for purposes of this provision, a payment is deemed to be made at the time an electronic funds transfer is made by the Controller to the tax collector or the delinquency date of the respective tax installment, whichever is later. Existing law, in the event of willful neglect, authorizes an electronic funds transfer for that current fiscal year to be used to pay delinquent taxes only if accompanied by sufficient amounts to pay all of the delinquent penalties, costs, fees, and interest. Existing law, if a denial of
		a claim for postponement is reversed on appeal, requires the Controller to electronically transfer funds to the county.This bill would instead deem a payment to be made at the time a payment is made by the Controller to the tax collector or the delinquency date of the respective tax installment, whichever is later. The bill would instead authorize a payment from the Controller to be used to pay delinquent taxes under the circumstances described above. The bill would eliminate the requirement that funds be transferred electronically if a denial of a claim for postponement is reversed on appeal. The bill would also make various conforming changes.(4) Existing law requires the Controller to reduce the amount of the obligation secured by the lien against the real property by the amount of any payments received for that purpose and by specified amounts paid by the Franchise Tax Board or by certain other
		authorized amounts.This bill would require that payments received for the reduction of the obligation be applied first to any interest due on the loan, 2nd to the principal property tax amount, and finally, if there is any remaining balance, to administrative fees.(5) Existing law authorizes recordation of certain documents, including a release, discharge, or subordination of a lien for postponed property taxes, without acknowledgment, certificate of acknowledgment, or further proof.This bill would delete the reference to the subordination of a lien for postponed property taxes from the list of documents that may be recorded without acknowledgment, certificate of acknowledgment, or further proof.(6) Existing law authorizes the County of Merced, by a
		4/5 vote of the board of supervisors, to sell a specified area of county property that the county has acquired from the federal government due to the closure of Castle Air Force Base.This bill would additionally authorize the County of Merced to enter into a lease, concession, or managerial contract involving that area, by a 4/5 vote of the board of supervisors. The bill would make additional conforming changes. (7) Existing law establishes the Committee on County Accounting Procedures which consists of 10 members appointed by the Controller. Of those 10 members, 5 of the members are required to be county auditors.This bill would instead require 5 of those
		members to be county auditors or county officers in equivalent positions.(8) Existing law requires a local agency that provides any type of compensation, salary, or stipend to a local agency official of that agency to provide sexual harassment prevention training and education, as specified. Existing law requires an entity that develops curricula to satisfy these requirements to consult with the city attorney or county counsel regarding the sufficiency and accuracy of that proposed content, as specified.This bill would instead require the entity to consult with the legal counsel of that entity.(9) Existing law requires the legislative body of a local agency, on or before December 31 of each year, to prepare an appointments list of all regular and ongoing boards, commissions, and committees which are appointed by the legislative body of
		the local agency known as the Local Appointments List. Existing law requires the list to be made available to members of the public, as specified, and requires the legislative body to designate the public library with the largest service population within its jurisdiction to receive a copy of the list.This bill would alternatively authorize the list to be posted on the local agency’s Internet Web site.(10) Existing law requires notice of an unscheduled vacancy that occurs in any board, commission, or committee for which the legislative body of a local agency has the appointing power to be posted in the office of the clerk of the local agency, a designated public library, and any other place as directed by the local agency.This bill would alternatively authorize the notice of an unscheduled vacancy to be posted on the local agency’s Internet Web site instead
		of being posted in the library.(11) Existing law authorizes a public agency, in the case of an emergency and with a vote of 4/5 of the governing body, to repair or replace a public facility, take any directly related and immediate action required by that emergency, and procure the necessary equipment, services, and supplies for the purposes, without giving notice for bids to let contracts.This bill would correct inaccurate cross-references and add 2 missing cross-references.(12) Existing law, except as provided in the property tax postponement program, prohibits a certificate of eligibility from being used to pay any delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, costs, fees, or interest, or any redemption charges.This bill would eliminate that prohibition.(13) Existing law, with respect to a claimant whose property taxes are paid by a lender from an impound, trust, or other specified type of account, requires the tax collector to notify the auditor of the claimant’s name and address, and the duplicate amount of money the Controller transferred to the tax collector via an electronic fund transfer. Existing law requires the county auditor, treasurer, or disbursing officer to send a check, in the amount of money based on the electronic transfer by the Controller, to the Controller within 60 days of the replicated payment.This bill, upon receipt of the payment by the Controller, as specified, would require the tax collector to maintain a record of the fact that taxes on the property have been postponed and, with respect to a claimant described above, to notify the auditor
		of the claimant’s name and address, and the duplicate amount of money the Controller paid to the tax collector. The bill would instead require the county auditor, treasurer, or disbursing officer to refund the amount of money, based on the payment by the Controller, to the claimant within 60 days of the replicated payment.(14) Existing law, upon receipt of a “notice of lien for postponed property taxes” from the Controller, requires the tax collector or the assessor, whichever is applicable, to immediately enter on the assessment records applicable to the property the fact that the taxes on the property have been postponed and the Controller’s identification number and to notify the Controller of a subsequent change in ownership status, as provided.This bill would instead require the assessor to maintain a record of the fact that the taxes on the property have been postponed and the Controller’s
		identification number and to notify the Controller as described above.(15) Existing law requires, for purposes of the Gonsalves-Deukmejian-Petris Senior Citizens Property Tax Assistance Law, that all losses and nonexpenses be converted to zero for the purpose of determining whether the homeowner meets the property tax postponement requirement.This bill would instead require that all losses and nonexpenses be converted to zero, as specified above, for the purposes of property tax postponement.(16) Existing law requires that a claimant for property tax postponement, generally, be an individual who is a member of the household, is either an owner-occupant, tenant stockholder occupant, or possessory interestholder occupant of the residential dwelling as to which postponement is claimed, and is either 62 years of age or older, blind, or
		disabled. With respect to blind and disabled claimants, existing law requires that the claimant be blind or disabled, as specified, at the time of application or on December 10 of the fiscal year for which postponement is claimed, whichever is earlier.This bill would instead require, for blind and disabled claimants, that the claimant be blind or disabled at the time of application or on February 10 of the fiscal year for which postponement is claimed.(17) Existing law authorizes a claimant to file with the Controller a claim for postponement in a specified amount for the fiscal year for which the claim is made. Existing law requires the Controller, upon verification of specified eligibility requirements, to mail to the claimant a Notice of Election to Postpone, as specified. When the Controller approves the Notice of Election to Postpone, existing law requires the Controller to make payments
		directly to the county tax collector.This bill would instead require the Controller to issue payment to the county tax collector or other appropriate payee, as determined by the Controller.(18) This bill would make various technical changes related to the property tax postponement program, including updating statutory references to the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Fund and deleting obsolete references to certificates of eligibility and postponement for mobilehomes.(19) Existing law establishes the North Fork Kings Groundwater Sustainability Agency and requires the agency to be governed by a 7-member board of directors. Existing law requires one member to be a resident or landowner within the territory of the agency chosen by the members of the governing board of the Riverdale Irrigation Company and
		the Reed Ditch Company.This bill would correct the name of the Riverdale Irrigation District and would make another technical change.(20) The Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency Act defines the term “project” for purposes of the act to mean the acquisition, construction, maintenance, or operation of any flood control facility authorized under the agreement and not inconsistent with the act, including, but not limited to, acquisition of any rights-of-way and easements.This bill would instead define the term to mean the acquisition, construction, maintenance, or operation of any flood control facility authorized under the agreement and not inconsistent with the act, including, but not limited to, acquisition of any interests in real property. The bill would make conforming changes.(21) Existing law, the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District Act, creates the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District within the County of Solano for purposes relating to the collection and disposal of sewage and industrial waste and the control and disposition of storm and flood waters.This bill would rename the act as the Vallejo Flood and Wastewater District Act and the district as the Vallejo Flood and Wastewater District. The bill would make other nonsubstantive changes within the act.(22) By changing the duties of local officials with respect to the administration of the property tax postponement program, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory
		provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.Digest Key

				  a lien shall attach to the mobilehome for which eligibility for the postponement of property taxes has been granted.SEC. 4. Section 16183 of the Government Code is amended to read:16183. (a) From the time a payment is made pursuant to Section 16180, the amount of that payment shall bear interest at a rate (not compounded), determined as follows:(1) Beginning July 1, 2016, the rate of interest shall be 7 percent per annum.(2) The Controller shall establish an adjusted rate of interest for the purpose of this subdivision not later than July 15th of any year if the effective annual yield of the Pooled Money Investment Account for the prior fiscal year is at least a full percentage point more or less than the interest rate which is then in effect. The adjusted rate of interest shall be equal per annum to the effective annual yield earned in the prior fiscal year by the Pooled Money
				  Investment Account rounded to the nearest full percent, and shall become effective for new deferrals, beginning on July 1, 1984, and on July 1 of each immediately succeeding year, until June 30, 2016.(3) For loans made prior to June 30, 2016, the rate of interest provided pursuant to this subdivision for the first fiscal year commencing after payment is made pursuant to Section 16180 shall apply for that fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter until these postponed property taxes are repaid.(b) The interest provided for in subdivision (a) shall be applied beginning the first day of the month following the month in which that payment is made and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until that amount is paid.

Special investigation has shown that the conditions within the district are peculiar to that area and that this act is essential to carry out the purposes herein expressed and for the elimination of duplication of governmental authority and securing greater economy of administration. It is further found and determined that the area within the district has no facilities for the sanitary treatment and disposal of sewage and is consequently contaminating and polluting the waters of San Francisco Bay. The area within the district is of strategic importance due to the proximity of Mare Island Navy Yard. The influx of Navy personnel and their families and civilian workers at the Mare Island Navy Yard has greatly aggravated the problem of sewage disposal in that area. The problem of sewage disposal is further aggravated by a lack of adequate drainage and flood
				  water control and the infiltration of storm and flood waters into existing sanitary sewers. Both the problem of sanitary sewage and drainage and the problem of storm water flood control are so interrelated that the special problems relating to each can only be solved by uniform administration and a uniform control plan of sewage disposal and flood control works.The Vallejo Flood and Wastewater District is hereby declared to be a body corporate and politic and may do all of the following:(a) Succession.

The board of trustees shall file with the Board of Supervisors of Solano County a certified copy of the map or plat of the district showing the zones into which the district has been divided and the percentage of the amount to be raised from each zone. All assessments for district purposes shall be made and collected by the County Assessor and Tax Collector, respectively, of the County of Solano. All lands situated within the district subject to assessments for district purposes but not included on the county roll for taxation for county purposes shall immediately upon the effective date of this act be placed upon and thereafter carried on the county roll of Solano County. The assessed valuation of the lands shall be determined and fixed by the county assessor and the amount of the assessed valuation
				  corrected and equalized by the Board of Supervisors of Solano County at the same time or times and in the same manner as the assessed valuation of other lands upon the assessment rolls are fixed, determined, corrected and equalized by the county officials.On or before the second Monday of August of each year, the County Auditor of Solano County shall transmit to the board of trustees of the district a statement in writing showing the total value of all land within the district, which value shall be ascertained from the assessment book of the county for that year as equalized and corrected by the board of supervisors of the county and which statement shall also show the total value of all land in each of the zones, respectively.The board of trustees shall on or before the third Monday in August determine the total amount to be raised by district assessment for the then current fiscal year and shall fix the rate of
				  assessment for each zone and the number of cents per each one hundred dollars ($100) using as a basis the value of land as it is assessed by the county assessor, and returned to the board of trustees of the district by the county auditor as hereinabove provided, which rate of taxation shall be sufficient to raise the total amount previously fixed by the board as hereinabove subscribed. Such acts by the board of trustees of the district shall constitute a valid assessment of the property and a valid levy of the assessment so fixed. The board of trustees shall immediately thereafter transmit to the County Auditor of Solano County a statement of the rate of assessment so fixed by the board for each zone into which the district may be divided, and the county auditor shall enter that rate upon the county tax roll. Such assessment so levied shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes, and when collected the net amount thereof shall be credited to the treasurer of the district and
				  shall be kept by the county treasurer in a separate fund to be designated “Vallejo Flood and Wastewater District Interest and Sinking Fund,” and the moneys in the fund shall be applied exclusively to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds of the district. The special assessments by the district shall be in addition to all other taxes and assessments levied for state, county or municipal purposes. If the district has been divided into zones and the percentage of the amount to be raised for the redemption of principal and interest of bonds of the district from each such zone has been determined as provided in this act, the amount of the assessment levy shall be divided according to the percentages and the percentage to be raised from the lands within each zone shall be levied upon and against the property of the zone as hereinabove provided. The district assessments shall be payable only with and not separately from county taxes when collected. Whenever any land situated in the district has been
				  sold for assessments and has been redeemed, the money paid for the redemption shall be apportioned and credited by the county treasurer to the district in the proportion which the assessment due to the district bears to the total tax for which the property was sold. All assessments levied under the provisions of this act shall be a lien upon the property on which they are levied and shall become due and payable and be delinquent at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes, and enforced in the same manner and by the same means as provided by law for the enforcement of liens for state and county taxes, all provisions of law relating to the enforcement of the latter being hereby made a part of this act.It shall be the duty of the Board of Supervisors of Solano County and of each and every officer of Solano County charged with any official duty relating to the levy and collection of county taxes to cause such district assessments to be levied and collected
				  at the time and in the same manner as county taxes are levied and collected, and in any event it shall be the duty of the board of trustees to cause the assessments to be levied against and upon all land within the district at the time for fixing the general tax levy for county purposes, and in the manner for the general tax levy provided, and to cause to be collected annually each year until the bonds are paid or until there shall be a sum in the treasury of the district set apart for that purpose to meet all sums coming due for principal and interest on the bonds, assessments sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds and also that part of the principal thereof as shall become due before the time for fixing the next general tax levy, in which assessments may be included a sum sufficient in the judgment of the board of trustees to take care of anticipated delinquencies; provided, however, that if the maturity of the indebtedness created by the issuance of bonds be made to begin more than one year after the
				  date of issuance thereof the assessments shall be levied and collected at the time and in the manner aforesaid annually each year in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on the indebtedness as it falls due and also to constitute a sinking fund for the redemption thereof on or before maturity. The assessments herein required to be levied and collected shall be in addition to all other assessments levied for district purposes and shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as other district assessments are collected, and be used for no other purpose than the payment of the bonds and accruing interest.All assessments levied by the district shall be levied solely upon lands within the district, including any land which is the operative property of any public utility, but excluding any personal property or any lands belonging to any county, municipality, or political subdivision within the district or lands belonging to the United States of America or
				  the State of California or the district.SEC. 38. Section 17 of the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District Act (Chapter 17 of the First Extraordinary Session of the Statutes of 1952), as amended by Section 277 of Chapter 357 of the Statutes of 1957, is amended to read:Sec.17. Assessments for Maintenance and Operation.

				  last preceding assessment roll for state and county purposes; provided, further, that those assessments shall be in addition to any assessment levied to meet the bonded indebtedness of the district and all interest thereon. Such assessments, when collected, shall be held by the treasurer in a special fund to be designated “Vallejo Flood and Wastewater Operation Fund.” The moneys in the fund shall be withdrawn on warrants authorized by the trustees. Prior to the bond election at which bonds shall be authorized as herein provided, the district shall have the right to incur indebtedness for organization purposes, preliminary engineering expenses, and general incidental expenses as in this act specified, to an amount not exceeding two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), the indebtedness to be evidenced by warrants of the district issued in payment of valid obligations incurred by the district, and which warrants shall be paid by the treasurer of the district out of the first proceeds of the sale of bonds of the
				  district or out of moneys collected from the annual assessment to be levied under this Section 17, and until so paid the warrants shall bear interest at the rate of 6 percent per year from date of presentation and registration until paid. If funds are not available for the payment of the warrants at the time of their presentation to the treasurer, the same shall be registered in the office of the treasurer and shall be paid in the order of their registration. The treasurer shall publish notice of call for redemption of the warrants or any thereof whenever funds are available for their payment, and interest on the warrants shall cease upon the date fixed for that redemption. The notice shall be published in the district pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code.The provisions in this Section 17 contained for the levy and collection of assessments for the payment of maintenance and operation costs of the district shall be effective for the Fiscal Year

The creation of any zone in the district shall not be effective for the purposes of any assessment unless and until the board of trustees shall file with the county assessor and also with the State Board of Equalization a map or plat showing the zones into which the district is to be divided and the percentages to be raised from each zone.SEC. 39. Section 28 of the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District Act (Chapter 17 of the First Extraordinary Session of the Statutes of 1952), is amended to read:Sec.28. Short Title.
