											  Electrical corporations: computation of average residential consumption of electricity and the baseline quantity for electricity usage.</span></div><div><span id="digesttext"><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. Existing law requires the commission to designate a baseline quantity of electricity and gas necessary for a significant portion of the reasonable energy needs of the average residential customer and to establish a higher energy allowance above the baseline for residential customers dependent on life-support equipment.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require the commission, when computing the average residential consumption of electricity and the baseline quantity for electricity usage, to appropriately account for any consumption that is met by residential customer
			 generation located on the customer’s side of the meter.</div><font color="blue" class="blue_text"><i><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 739 of the Public Utilities Code proposed by SB 711 to be operative only if this bill and SB 711 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.</div></i></font></span></div><span class="hidden"><h2>Digest Key</h2></span><span id="vote">

In establishing the baseline quantities, the commission shall take into account climatic and seasonal variations in consumption and the availability of gas service. The commission shall review and revise baseline quantities as average
						consumption patterns change in order to maintain these ratios. When computing the average residential consumption of electricity and the “baseline quantity” for usage of electricity, the commission shall appropriately account for any consumption that is met by residential customer generation located on the customer’s side of the meter.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) “Residential customer” means those customers receiving electrical or gas service pursuant to a domestic rate schedule and excludes industrial, commercial, and every other category of customer.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(b) The commission shall designate a baseline quantity of gas and electricity which is necessary to supply a significant portion of the reasonable energy needs of the average residential customer. In estimating those quantities, the commission
						shall take into account differentials in energy needs between customers whose residential energy needs are currently supplied by electricity alone or by both electricity and gas. The commission shall develop a separate baseline quantity for all-electric residential customers. For these purposes, “all-electric residential customers” are residential customers having electrical service only or whose space heating is provided by electricity, or both. The commission shall also take into account differentials in energy use by climatic zone and season.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(c) (1) The commission shall establish a standard limited allowance which shall be in addition to the baseline quantity of gas and electricity for residential customers dependent on life-support equipment, including, but not limited to, emphysema and pulmonary patients.

In establishing these rates, the commission shall avoid excessive rate increases for residential customers, and shall establish an appropriate gradual differential between the rates for the respective blocks of usage.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) In establishing residential electric and gas rates, including baseline rates, the commission shall ensure that the rates are sufficient to enable the electrical corporation or gas corporation to recover a just and reasonable amount of revenue from residential customers as a class, while observing the principle that electricity and gas services are necessities, for which a low affordable rate is desirable and while observing the principle that conservation is desirable in order to maintain an affordable bill.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(3) At least until December 31, 2003, the commission shall require that all charges for residential electric customers are volumetric, and shall prohibit any electrical corporation from imposing any charges on residential consumption that are independent of consumption, unless those charges are in place prior to April 12,
