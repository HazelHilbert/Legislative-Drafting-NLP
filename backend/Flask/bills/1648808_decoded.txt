THE
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN ENACT:
 
CHAPTER IV
 
     Sec.
27a. (1) A juvenile , other than a juvenile confined 
 
under
subsection (3), shall not be

while awaiting trial.
 
     (2)
A juvenile, other than a juvenile confined under 
 
subsection
(3), whose habits or conduct are considered to be a 
 
menace
to other children, or who may not otherwise be safely 




detained,
may be ordered by a court to be placed in a jail or other 
 
place
of detention for adults, but in a room or ward out of sight 
 
and
sound from adults.
 
     (3)
A juvenile or individual less than 17 years of age who is 
 
under
the jurisdiction of the circuit court or recorder's court of 
 
the
city of Detroit for committing a felony may be confined in the 
 
county
jail pending trial. An individual less than 17 years of age 
 
who
is under the jurisdiction of the probate court for committing a 
 
felony
may be held in the county jail pending trial if the case is 
 
designated
by the court under section 2d of chapter XIIA of Act No. 
 
288
of the Public Acts of 1939, being section 712A.2d of the 
 
Michigan
Compiled Laws, as a case in which the individual is to be 
 
tried
in the same manner as an adult and the court has determined 
 
that
there is probable cause to believe that the felony was 
 
committed
and that there is probable cause to believe the 
 
individual
committed that felony. If a juvenile or individual less 
 
than
17 years of age is confined in the county jail under this 
 
subsection,
the juvenile or individual less than 17 years of age 
 
shall
be held physically separate from adult prisoners. A juvenile 
 
or
individual less than 17 years of age shall not be confined in 
 
the
county jail under this subsection without the prior approval of 
 
the
county sheriff. As used in this subsection, "felony" means a 
 
crime
that is designated by law as a felony or that is punishable 
 
by
imprisonment for more than 1 year.
 
     (2) (4)
The court, upon motion of a
juvenile or individual 
 
less
than 17 18 years of age who is subject to confinement under 
 
subsection
(3) may, for good cause shown,
order the juvenile or 




individual
less than 17 18 years of age to be confined as otherwise 
 
provided
by law.
 
     (3) (5)
If a person is convicted of a crime
within this state 
 
and
has served time in a juvenile facility before sentencing 
 
because
of being denied or being unable to furnish bond for the 
 
offense
of which he or she is convicted, the trial court in 
 
imposing
sentence shall specifically grant credit against the 
 
sentence
for time served in a juvenile facility before sentencing.
 
     Enacting
section 1. This amendatory act takes effect October
