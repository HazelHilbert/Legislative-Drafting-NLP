Sec. 2. Section 79-608, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
79-608 (1) Any person, before operating a school bus, including any school
bus which transports students by direct contract with the students or their
parents and not owned by or under contract with the school district or
nonpublic school, shall submit himself or herself to (a) an examination, to be
conducted by a driver's license examiner of the Department of Motor Vehicles,
to determine his or her qualifications to operate such bus and (b) an
examination by a licensed physician to determine whether or not he or she meets
the physical and mental standards established pursuant to section 79-607 and
shall furnish to the school board or board of education or the governing
authority of a nonpublic school and to the Director of Motor Vehicles  a written
report of each such examination on standard forms prescribed by the State
Department of Education, signed by the person conducting the same, showing that
he or she is qualified to operate a school bus and that he or she meets the
physical and mental standards.  If the Director of Motor Vehicles determines
that the person is so qualified and meets such standards, the director shall
issue to the person a special school bus operator's permit, which shall expire
each year on the date of birth of the holder, in such form as the director
prescribes. No contract shall be entered into until such permit has been
received and exhibited to the school board or the governing authority of a
nonpublic school. The holder of such permit shall have it on his or her person
at all times while operating a school bus.
(2) It shall be unlawful for any person operating a school bus to be or
remain on duty for a longer period than sixteen consecutive hours. When any
person operating a bus has been continuously on duty for sixteen hours, he or
she shall be relieved and not be permitted or required to again go on duty
without having at least ten consecutive hours' rest off duty, and no such
operator, who has been on duty sixteen hours in the aggregate in any twenty-
four-hour period, shall be required or permitted to continue or again go on
duty without having had at least eight consecutive hours off duty.
(3) Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a Class V
misdemeanor. His or her contract with the school district shall be canceled as
provided in section 79-607.
Sec. 3.  This act becomes operative on January 1, 2019.
Sec. 4.  Original section 79-608, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
and section 60-4,115, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2016, are
repealed.LB347
