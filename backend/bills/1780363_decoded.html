<p><font face="Book Antiqua">(e) The patient or such patient's legal representative or attorney shall have the right of access to records made, maintained or kept on file by the department, in accordance with all applicable state and federal law, when such records pertain to or contain information or material concerning the patient, including, but not limited to, records concerning investigations, reports or medical, psychological or psychiatric examinations of the patient, except: (1) If protected health information was obtained by the department from someone other than a health care provider under the promise of confidentiality and the access requested would, with reasonable likelihood, reveal the source of the information; (2) information identifying the individual who reported the abuse of the person shall not be released unless, upon application made to the Superior Court by the patient or such patient's legal representative or attorney and served on the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, a judge determines, after in camera inspection of relevant records and a hearing, that there is reasonable cause to believe the individual knowingly made a false report or that other interests of justice require such release; (3) if it is determined by a licensed health care provider that the access requested is reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the patient or another person; (4) if the protected health information makes reference to another person, other than a health care provider, and the access requested would reveal protected health information about such other person; or (5) the request for access is made by the patient's legal representative, and a licensed health care provider has determined, in the exercise of professional judgment, that the provision of access to such legal representative is reasonably likely to cause harm to the patient or another person.</font></p>
