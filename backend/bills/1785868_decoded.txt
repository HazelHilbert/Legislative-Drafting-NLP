service serving within and between counties with a population o f 70,000
or more, and section 6  removes large-market taxicab service providers
from the common carrier obligation to obtain a certificate of p ublic
convenience and necessity.
Sections 9 and 11  require large-market taxicab service providers
to operate as motor carriers. As motor carriers, large-market t axicab
service providers are required to obtain an annual permit (sect ion 9) and
are subject to the public utilities commission's regulations re garding
safety and operational requirements, but not subject to regulat ions
regarding times of operation, rates, or competition (section 11 ).
Section 4  continues to require drivers for a large-market taxicab
service company to obtain a fingerprint-based criminal history record
check.
Section 3  declares large-market taxicab service to be affected with
a public interest. Large-market taxicab service operators are s till required
to indiscriminately accept and carry passengers for compensatio n.
Section 11  requires the public utilities commission to promulgate
rules requiring taxicab service and large-market taxicab servic e
companies to collect information about each driver's driving re cord and
violations and periodically to provide the information to the c ommission.
A taxicab service or large-market taxicab service company may r equest
that the commission share with the company information about a specific
driver that any other taxicab service or large-market taxicab s ervice
company has provided to the commission. The commission is requi red
otherwise to maintain the confidentiality of the information, a nd the
information is not subject to disclosure under the "Colorado Op en
Records Act".
