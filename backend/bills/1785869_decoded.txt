1 AN ACT concerning education.

2 WHEREAS, Research-based prevention and wellness promotion 3efforts that strengthen positive parenting practices and 4enhance a child's resilience in the face of adversity have been 5shown to have a significant impact on a child's mental health, 6physical health, and educational outcomes; and
7 WHEREAS, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 8define positive parenting skills as good communication, 9appropriate discipline, and responding to a child's physical 10and emotional needs; and
11 WHEREAS, Studies in the last decade have shown that 12well-designed programs created to promote healthy cognitive, 13emotional, and social development can improve the prospects and 14quality of life of many children; and
15 WHEREAS, Parenting programs have been shown to provide 16critical information on child development and safety, promote 17positive parenting behaviors, teach effective discipline 18strategies, alter adverse family patterns, and reduce levels of 19child abuse and neglect; and
20 WHEREAS, Positive parenting practices are directly linked 21to adaptive behaviors in children and can buffer adverse 22outcomes, even amongst at-risk families; and
  HB4442 Engrossed- 2 -LRB100 17751 AXK 32926 b
1 WHEREAS, While positive parenting strategies can promote 2adjustment and achievement, child abuse and neglect can 3interrupt healthy development in children and can lead to 4maladaptive functioning; and
5 WHEREAS, In the first major study of child abuse and 6neglect in 20 years, researchers with the National Academy of 7Sciences reported that the damaging consequences of abuse can 8reshape a child's brain (resulting in consequences that last 9throughout his or her life), influence the child's amygdala 10(the part of the brain that regulates emotions, particularly 11fear and anxiety), and change how the functioning prefrontal 12cortex works (the part of the brain responsible for thinking, 13planning, reasoning, and decision-making), which can lead to 14behavioral and academic problems; and
15 WHEREAS, Research shows an association between child 16maltreatment and a broad range of social problems, including 17substance abuse, violence, criminal behavior, teenage 18pregnancy, anxiety, sexually transmitted diseases, smoking, 19obesity, and diabetes; and
20 WHEREAS, Child abuse and neglect is a serious health 21problem that costs the United States $103 billion annually, 22which includes $33 billion in direct costs for foster care   HB4442 Engrossed- 3 -LRB100 17751 AXK 32926 b
1services, hospitalization, mental health treatment, and law 2enforcement and $70 billion in indirect costs, including 3productivity, chronic health problems, and special education; 4and
5 WHEREAS, Nobel prize-winning economist James J. Heckman 6and others have shown that for every dollar devoted to the 7nurturing of young children, the need for greater government 8spending on remedial education, teenage pregnancy, and prison 9incarceration may be eliminated; and
10 WHEREAS, Researchers have found that, left untreated, the 11effects of child abuse and neglect can profoundly influence a 12victim's physical and mental health, emotions and impulses, 13achievements in school, and relationships formed as a child and 14as an adult; and
15 WHEREAS, The American Academy of Pediatrics' Psychological 16Maltreatment Clinical Report posits that emotional abuse is 17linked with mental illness, delinquency, aggression, school 18troubles, and lifelong relationship problems in children; 19these effects of ill-treatment on a child's brain and 20behavioral development are not static and can be reversed with 21quick intervention and positive changes in a child's 22environment; the negative changes present in a child's brain 23can be countered by positive brain changes that take place when   HB4442 Engrossed- 4 -LRB100 17751 AXK 32926 b
1the abuse ends and when the child is given the support he or 2she requires; parenting education is an effective way to 3prevent abuse and mental illness before it starts; therefore
