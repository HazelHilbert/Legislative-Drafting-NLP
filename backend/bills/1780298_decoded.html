		determination is made that sufficient funds have been received to pay initial costs of this bill, provide for the licensure and regulation of athletic trainers, as defined. The bill would, after that determination, establish the Athletic Trainer Licensing Committee within the California Board of Occupational Therapy to implement these provisions, including issuing and renewing athletic training licenses and imposing disciplinary action. Under the bill, the committee would be comprised of 7 members, to be appointed to 4-year terms, except as specified. Commencing 6 months after the committee is established by this bill, the bill would prohibit a person from practicing as an athletic trainer or using certain titles without a license issued by the committee, except as specified. The bill would prohibit, except in specified cases for a specified period, a person from using the title “athletic trainer,” unless the person is licensed by the committee or other conditions are met. The bill would specify the
		requirements for licensure, including education, examination, and the payment of a license application fee established by the committee. The bill would define the practice of athletic training and prescribe direction requirements on athletic trainers.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">The bill would also establish the Athletic Trainers’ Fund for the deposit of license application and renewal fees, as specified, and would make those fees available to the committee for the purpose of implementing these provisions upon appropriation by the Legislature. The bill would authorize the Director of Consumer Affairs to seek and receive donations from the California Athletic Trainers Association or any other private person or entity for purposes of obtaining funds for the startup costs of implementing the act. The bill would require the director to determine that sufficient funds for that purpose have been obtained and to provide notice to the Legislature, the Governor, and on the department’s Internet Web
		site of the determination, as specified. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2026. By changing the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</div></span></div><span class="hidden"><h2>Digest Key</h2></span><span id="vote">
