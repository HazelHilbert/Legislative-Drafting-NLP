   (Coauthor: Assembly Member Portantino)

                        FEBRUARY 19, 2010

</strike> <em> Section 11166 </em> of the Penal Code, relating to
child abuse.



	LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST


   AB 2380, as amended, Bonnie Lowenthal. Child abuse <strike>
prevention. </strike> <em> reporting. </em>
   Existing law identifies specified persons as mandated reporters
who must submit a report to law enforcement whenever in their
professional capacity or within the scope of their employment, they
have knowledge of or observe a child who is known or reasonably
suspected to have been the victim of child abuse or neglect. Existing
law defines the term "reasonable suspicion" for purposes of these
child abuse reporting provisions.
   This bill would provide that "reasonable suspicion" does not
require <strike> certain knowledge </strike> <em> certainty </em>
that child abuse or neglect has occurred nor does it require a
specific medical indication of child abuse or neglect. The bill would
also provide that "reasonable suspicion" may be based on any
information considered credible by the reporter, including <strike>
hearsay </strike> <em> statements from other individuals </em> .
<strike>
   Existing law requires the Department of Justice to maintain an
index of all reports of child abuse and severe neglect submitted by
agencies mandated to make those reports. </strike> <strike>
   This bill would require the department to make available to
certain health care practitioners who have delivered or treated a
newborn infant information regarding any known or suspected child
abuser maintained on the index concerning any parent or primary care
provider of the newborn infant. The bill would provide that the
health care practitioner is responsible for obtaining the original
investigative report from the reporting agency and for drawing
independent conclusions on the evidence for purposes of evaluating
the necessity for a child welfare risk assessment. The bill would
require the health care practitioner to notify the local child
protective services agency if it is determined that a child welfare
risk assessment is appropriate. </strike> <strike>
   Existing law requires a person convicted of any specified sex
offenses to register as a sex offender and provide specified
information to law enforcement agencies. That information is kept at
the location where the offender registered and transmitted to the
Department of Justice where it is electronically stored in the
Violent Crime Information Network (VCIN), as specified. </strike>
<strike>
   This bill would require the Department of Justice to study the
feasibility and value of requiring every person who must register as
a sex offender to include in the information provided by the person
all e-mail addresses and instant message addresses, all screen names
and online pseudonyms, and all Internet protocol addresses he or she
uses, or intends to use, to communicate over the Internet. The bill
would require the department's study to include a determination of
the value and feasibility of incorporating this information in the
VCIN, and would require the department to complete and publish its
report by December 31, 2011. </strike> <strike>
   This bill would make technical and conforming changes. </strike>
   Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: <strike> yes
</strike> <em> no </em> . State-mandated local program: no.


THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  SECTION 1.  Section 11166 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
   11166.  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (d), and in Section
11166.05, a mandated reporter shall make a report to an agency
specified in Section 11165.9 whenever the mandated reporter, in his
or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her
employment, has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated
reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child
abuse or neglect. The mandated reporter shall make an initial report
to the agency immediately or as soon as is practicably possible by
telephone and the mandated reporter shall prepare and send, fax, or
electronically transmit a written followup report thereof within 36
hours of receiving the information concerning the incident. The
mandated reporter may include with the report any nonprivileged
documentary evidence the mandated reporter possesses relating to the
incident.
   (1) For purposes of this article, "reasonable suspicion" means
that it is objectively reasonable for a person to entertain a
suspicion, based upon facts that could cause a reasonable person in a
like position, drawing, when appropriate, on his or her training and
experience, to suspect child abuse or neglect. "Reasonable suspicion"
does not require <strike> certain knowledge </strike> <em> certainty
</em> that child abuse or neglect has occurred nor does it require a
specific medical indication of child abuse or neglect; any
"reasonable suspicion" is sufficient. "Reasonable suspicion" may be
based on any information considered credible by the reporter,
including <strike> hearsay </strike> <em> statements from other
individuals </em> . For the purpose of this article, the pregnancy of
a minor does not, in and of itself, constitute a basis for a
reasonable suspicion of sexual abuse.
   (2) The agency shall be notified and a report shall be prepared
and sent, faxed, or electronically transmitted even if the child has
expired, regardless of whether or not the possible abuse was a factor
contributing to the death, and even if suspected child abuse was
discovered during an autopsy.
   (3) Any report made by a mandated reporter pursuant to this
section shall be known as a mandated report.
   (b) If after reasonable efforts a mandated reporter is unable to
submit an initial report by telephone, he or she shall immediately or
as soon as is practicably possible, by fax or electronic
transmission, make a one-time automated written report on the form
prescribed by the Department of Justice, and shall also be available
to respond to a telephone followup call by the agency with which he
or she filed the report. A mandated reporter who files a one-time
automated written report because he or she was unable to submit an
initial report by telephone is not required to submit a written
followup report.
   (1) The one-time automated written report form prescribed by the
Department of Justice shall be clearly identifiable so that it is not
mistaken for a standard written followup report. In addition, the
automated one-time report shall contain a section that allows the
mandated reporter to state the reason the initial telephone call was
not able to be completed. The reason for the submission of the
one-time automated written report in lieu of the procedure prescribed
in subdivision (a) shall be captured in the Child Welfare
Services/Case Management System (CWS/CMS). The department shall work
with stakeholders to modify reporting forms and the CWS/CMS as is
necessary to accommodate the changes enacted by these provisions.
   (2) This subdivision shall not become operative until the CWS/CMS
is updated to capture the information prescribed in this subdivision.

   (3) This subdivision shall become inoperative three years after
this subdivision becomes operative or on January 1, 2009, whichever
occurs first.
   (4) On the inoperative date of these provisions, a report shall be
submitted to the counties and the Legislature by the Department of
Social Services that reflects the data collected from automated
one-time reports indicating the reasons stated as to why the
automated one-time report was filed in lieu of the initial telephone
report.
   (5) Nothing in this section shall supersede the requirement that a
mandated reporter first attempt to make a report via telephone, or
that agencies specified in Section 11165.9 accept reports from
mandated reporters and other persons as required.
   (c) Any mandated reporter who fails to report an incident of known
or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect as required by this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months
confinement in a county jail or by a fine of one thousand dollars
($1,000) or by both that imprisonment and fine. If a mandated
reporter intentionally conceals his or her failure to report an
incident known by the mandated reporter to be abuse or severe neglect
under this section, the failure to report is a continuing offense
until an agency specified in Section 11165.9 discovers the offense.
   (d) (1) A clergy member who acquires knowledge or a reasonable
suspicion of child abuse or neglect during a penitential
communication is not subject to subdivision (a). For the purposes of
this subdivision, "penitential communication" means a communication,
intended to be in confidence, including, but not limited to, a
sacramental confession, made to a clergy member who, in the course of
the discipline or practice of his or her church, denomination, or
organization, is authorized or accustomed to hear those
communications, and under the discipline, tenets, customs, or
practices of his or her church, denomination, or organization, has a
duty to keep those communications secret.
   (2) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to modify or
limit a clergy member's duty to report known or suspected child abuse
or neglect when the clergy member is acting in some other capacity
that would otherwise make the clergy member a mandated reporter.
   (3) (A) On or before January 1, 2004, a clergy member or any
custodian of records for the clergy member may report to an agency
specified in Section 11165.9 that the clergy member or any custodian
of records for the clergy member, prior to January 1, 1997, in his or
her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her
employment, other than during a penitential communication, acquired
knowledge or had a reasonable suspicion that a child had been the
victim of sexual abuse that the clergy member or any custodian of
records for the clergy member did not previously report the abuse to
an agency specified in Section 11165.9. The provisions of Section
11172 shall apply to all reports made pursuant to this paragraph.
   (B) This paragraph shall apply even if the victim of the known or
suspected abuse has reached the age of majority by the time the
required report is made.
   (C) The local law enforcement agency shall have jurisdiction to
investigate any report of child abuse made pursuant to this paragraph
even if the report is made after the victim has reached the age of
majority.
   (e) Any commercial film and photographic print processor who has
knowledge of or observes, within the scope of his or her professional
capacity or employment, any film, photograph, videotape, negative,
or slide depicting a child under the age of 16 years engaged in an
act of sexual conduct, shall report the instance of suspected child
abuse to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the case
immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, by telephone and
shall prepare and send, fax, or electronically transmit a written
report of it with a copy of the film, photograph, videotape,
negative, or slide attached within 36 hours of receiving the
information concerning the incident. As used in this subdivision,
"sexual conduct" means any of the following:
   (1) Sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital,
anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or
opposite sex or between humans and animals.
   (2) Penetration of the vagina or rectum by any object.
   (3) Masturbation for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the
viewer.
   (4) Sadomasochistic abuse for the purpose of sexual stimulation of
the viewer.
   (5) Exhibition of the genitals, pubic, or rectal areas of any
person for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.
   (f) Any mandated reporter who knows or reasonably suspects that
the home or institution in which a child resides is unsuitable for
the child because of abuse or neglect of the child shall bring the
condition to the attention of the agency to which, and at the same
time as, he or she makes a report of the abuse or neglect pursuant to
subdivision (a).
   (g) Any other person who has knowledge of or observes a child whom
he or she knows or reasonably suspects has been a victim of child
abuse or neglect may report the known or suspected instance of child
abuse or neglect to an agency specified in Section 11165.9. For
purposes of this section, "any other person" includes a mandated
reporter who acts in his or her private capacity and not in his or
her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her
employment.
   (h) When two or more persons, who are required to report, jointly
have knowledge of a known or suspected instance of child abuse or
neglect, and when there is agreement among them, the telephone report
may be made by a member of the team selected by mutual agreement and
a single report may be made and signed by the selected member of the
reporting team. Any member who has knowledge that the member
designated to report has failed to do so shall thereafter make the
report.
   (i) (1) The reporting duties under this section are individual,
and no supervisor or administrator may impede or inhibit the
reporting duties, and no person making a report shall be subject to
any sanction for making the report. However, internal procedures to
facilitate reporting and apprise supervisors and administrators of
reports may be established provided that they are not inconsistent
with this article.
   (2) The internal procedures shall not require any employee
required to make reports pursuant to this article to disclose his or
her identity to the employer.
   (3) Reporting the information regarding a case of possible child
abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school
counselor, coworker, or other person shall not be a substitute for
making a mandated report to an agency specified in Section 11165.9.
   (j) A county probation or welfare department shall immediately, or
as soon as practicably possible, report by telephone, fax, or
electronic transmission to the law enforcement agency having
jurisdiction over the case, to the agency given the responsibility
for investigation of cases under Section 300 of the Welfare and
Institutions Code, and to the district attorney's office every known
or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect, as defined in
Section 11165.6, except acts or omissions coming within subdivision
(b) of Section 11165.2, or reports made pursuant to Section 11165.13
based on risk to a child which relates solely to the inability of the
parent to provide the child with regular care due to the parent's
substance abuse, which shall be reported only to the county welfare
or probation department. A county probation or welfare department
also shall send, fax, or electronically transmit a written report
thereof within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the
incident to any agency to which it makes a telephone report under
this subdivision.
   (k) A law enforcement agency shall immediately, or as soon as
practicably possible, report by telephone, fax, or electronic
transmission to the agency given responsibility for investigation of
cases under Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and to
the district attorney's office every known or suspected instance of
child abuse or neglect reported to it, except acts or omissions
coming within subdivision (b) of Section 11165.2, which shall be
reported only to the county welfare or probation department. A law
enforcement agency shall report to the county welfare or probation
department every known or suspected instance of child abuse or
neglect reported to it which is alleged to have occurred as a result
of the action of a person responsible for the child's welfare, or as
the result of the failure of a person responsible for the child's
welfare to adequately protect the minor from abuse when the person
responsible for the child's welfare knew or reasonably should have
known that the minor was in danger of abuse. A law enforcement agency
also shall send, fax, or electronically transmit a written report
thereof within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the
incident to any agency to which it makes a telephone report under
this subdivision. <strike>
  SEC. 2.  </strike> <strike> Section 11167.5 of the Penal Code is
amended to read:
   11167.5.  (a) The reports required by Sections 11166 and 11166.2,
or authorized by Section 11166.05, and child abuse or neglect
investigative reports that result in a summary report being filed

11169 shall be confidential and may be disclosed only as provided in

   (c) The Department of Justice shall make available to any agency
responsible for placing children pursuant to Article 7 (commencing
with Section 305) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Welfare
and Institutions Code, upon request, relevant information concerning
child abuse or neglect reports contained in the index, when making a
placement with a responsible relative pursuant to Sections 281.5,
305, and 361.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Upon receipt of
relevant information concerning child abuse or neglect reports
contained in the index from the Department of Justice pursuant to
this subdivision, the agency shall also notify in writing the person
listed in the Child Abuse Central Index that he or she is in the
index. The notification shall include the location of the original
investigative report and the submitting agency. The notification
shall be submitted to the person listed at the same time that all
other parties are notified of the information, and no later than the
actual judicial proceeding that determines placement.
   If Child Abuse Central Index information is requested by an agency
for the placement of a child with a responsible relative in an
emergency situation pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section
305) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Welfare and
Institutions Code, the department is exempt from the requirements of
Section 1798.18 of the Civil Code if compliance would cause a delay
in providing an expedited response to the child protective agency's
inquiry and if further delay in placement may be detrimental to the
child.
   (d) The department shall make available any information maintained
pursuant to subdivision (a) to out-of-state law enforcement agencies
conducting investigations of known or suspected child abuse or
neglect only when an agency makes the request for information in
writing and on official letterhead, or as designated by the
department, identifying the suspected abuser or victim by name and
date of birth or approximate age. The request shall be signed by the
department supervisor of the requesting law enforcement agency. The
written requests shall cite the out-of-state statute or interstate
compact provision that requires that the information contained within
these reports shall be disclosed only to law enforcement,
prosecutorial entities, or multidisciplinary investigative teams, and
shall cite the safeguards in place to prevent unlawful disclosure of
any confidential information provided by the requesting state or the
applicable interstate compact provision.
   (e) (1) The department shall make available to an out-of-state
agency, for purposes of approving a prospective foster or adoptive
parent in compliance with the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety
Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248), information regarding a known or
suspected child abuser maintained pursuant to subdivision (a)
concerning the prospective foster or adoptive parent, and any other
adult living in the home of the prospective foster or adoptive
parent. The department shall make that information available only
when the out-of-state agency makes the request indicating that
continual compliance will be maintained with the requirement in
paragraph (20) of subdivision (a) of Section 671 of Title 42 of the
United States Code that requires the state to have in place
safeguards to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information in
any child abuse and neglect registry maintained by the state and
prevent the information from being used for a purpose other than the
conducting of background checks in foster or adoption placement
cases.
   (2) With respect to any information provided by the department in
response to the out-of-state agency's request, the out-of-state
agency is responsible for obtaining the original investigative report
from the reporting agency, and for drawing independent conclusions
regarding the quality of the evidence disclosed and its sufficiency
for making decisions regarding the approval of prospective foster or
adoptive parents.
   (3) (A) Whenever information contained in the index is furnished
pursuant to this subdivision, the department shall charge the
out-of-state agency making the request a fee. The fee shall not
exceed the reasonable costs to the department of providing the
information. The only increase shall be at a rate not to exceed the
legislatively approved cost-of-living adjustment for the department.
In no case shall the fee exceed fifteen dollars ($15).
   (B) All moneys received by the department pursuant to this
subdivision shall be deposited in the Department of Justice Child
Abuse Fund, established under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (11) of
subdivision (b). Moneys in the fund shall be available, upon
appropriation by the Legislature, for expenditure by the department
to offset the costs incurred to process requests for information
pursuant to this subdivision.
   (f) The department shall make available to any public health
nurse, treating physician or agent thereof, or other health care
practitioner who has delivered or treated a newborn infant,
information regarding any known or suspected child abuser maintained
pursuant to subdivision (a) concerning any parent or primary care
provider of the newborn infant. The public health nurse, treating
physician or agent thereof, or other health care practitioner is
responsible for obtaining the original investigative report from the
reporting agency, and for drawing independent conclusions regarding
the quality of the evidence disclosed and the sufficiency of the
evidence for the purpose of making decisions when evaluating the
necessity for a child welfare risk assessment. If it is determined
that a child welfare risk assessment is appropriate, the public
health nurse, treating physician or agent thereof, or other health
care practitioner shall notify the local child protective services
agency so that a child welfare risk assessment can be conducted.
   (g) (1) Any person may determine if he or she is listed in the
Child Abuse Central Index by making a request in writing to the
Department of Justice. The request shall be notarized and include the
person's name, address, date of birth, and either a social security
number or a California identification number. Upon receipt of a
notarized request, the Department of Justice shall make available to
the requesting person information identifying the date of the report
and the submitting agency. The requesting person is responsible for
obtaining the investigative report from the submitting agency
pursuant to paragraph (11) of subdivision (b) of Section 11167.5.
   (2) No person or agency shall require or request another person to
furnish a copy of a record concerning himself or herself, or
notification that a record concerning himself or herself exists or
does not exist, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision.
   (h) If a person is listed in the Child Abuse Central Index only as
a victim of child abuse or neglect, and that person is 18 years of
age or older, that person may have his or her name removed from the
index by making a written request to the Department of Justice. The
request shall be notarized and include the person's name, address,
social security number, and date of birth. </strike> <strike>
  SEC. 4.  </strike> <strike> The Department of Justice shall study
the feasibility and value of requiring every person who must register
pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (Chapter 5.5
(commencing with Section 290) of Title 9 of Part 1 of the Penal Code)

addresses and instant message addresses, all screen names and online
pseudonyms, and all Internet protocol addresses he or she uses, or
intends to use, to communicate over the Internet. The Department of

feasibility of incorporating this information in the Violent Crime
Information Network (VCIN). The Department of Justice shall complete
and publish its report by December 31, 2011. </strike>
