AN ACT
Providing for school entity procedures for tick removal, for  
notification and for duties of the Department of Health and  
the Department of Education.
The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  
hereby enacts as follows:
Section 1.  Short title.
This act shall be known and may be cited as the Lyme Disease  
Prevention in Schools Act.
Section 2.  Declaration of policy.
The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
(1)  In the last six years, this Commonwealth ranked  
highest in the country in the number of confirmed cases of  
Lyme disease.
(2)  In 2016, Pennsylvania reported 12,200 cases of Lyme  
disease, which translates to 122,000 new cases, and about 40%  
of the nation's cases in Pennsylvania alone.
(3)  The Department of Environmental Protection published  1

a study in 2015 that confirmed a high risk of Lyme disease in  
every county of this Commonwealth and found all 67 counties  
had the blacklegged tick.
(4)  The early clinical diagnosis and appropriate  
treatment of these tick-borne disorders and diseases can  
greatly reduce the risks of continued, diverse and chronic  
symptoms that can affect every system and organ of the human  
body and often every aspect of an individual's life.
(5)  Residents of this Commonwealth should be aware of  
early disseminated and persistent Lyme disease symptoms and  
should know that a negative test for Lyme disease cannot rule  
out Lyme disease.
(6)  The high burden of tick-borne diseases in this  
Commonwealth requires an urgent and ongoing response.  
Increasing education and prevention in the school setting is  
a specific recommended strategy.
(7)  With children representing the highest risk group,  
schools are an accessible channel to quickly reduce exposures  
and catch disease early.
