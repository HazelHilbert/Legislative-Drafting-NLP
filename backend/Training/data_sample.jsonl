She had \u00bbo issue born alive. Margaret intermarried with John Alston, and Temperance with James Alston, and the said Alstons and wives filed their bill against James Branch, who survived his wife Mourning, for an account of so much of the estate of the testator,-Micaj ah Thomas, as had been allotted to the said Mourning shortly after her mar.riage, and as had come to the hands of said Branch: and also against William Arrington, who had been guardian to the said Mourning, to restrain him from paying over to Branch such monies, belonging to the estate of the said Mourning, as were then in his hands; and the bill prayed that Branch might be decreed to deliver up to Complainants, the negroes and other estates, and pay over to them such monies as were in hie hands, belonging to the estate of the said Mourning.\nTo this hill the Defendants demurred, and it was submitted to the Supreme Court, Whether the estate vested absolutely i\u00f1 Mourning when she attained eighteen or when she married j or whether it ceased and determined > by her death without issue after marriage 2\nHaywood, for the Complainants,\ncontended, that, the testator had two events to guard against; one was, a marriage before eighteen, which, owing to the inexperience of his daughters, might be very imprudent: the other was, the death of his daughters before marriage, or after marriage and before having issue, in which event the whple real estate must escheat to the public : for being illegitimate, the surviving sisters could not inherit the lands, and being married, the sister about to die could not devise them. For the first of these events Hhe testator provided, by saying, that if one or two of his daughters die before eighteen, the estate shall go over: and marriage and having issue before such death, to wit, death before eighteen, will not cause the estate to vest absolutely, but upon such death the estate shall go over, and nothing be left for the issue. For the object of the testator was, to prevent the early and imprudent marriages of his daughters, and there is no ground to believe that he intended the estate of the legatee to become indefeasible, unless she attained eighteen, married, and had issue thereby. The plain intent of the testator was, to create cross-i\u2019emainders amongst the daughters; this intention is not positively expressed, but it is necessarily inferred from the terms of the devise. There is no rule of construction better established by authorities than this, that if a testator give property to several persons, and direct that all that property shall go over, upon the death of the .legatees under certain circumstances, such property shall not go over in parcels, but will remain amongst such of them as survive. So if he direct that it shall go over if all the legatees die under such circumstances, if one or some of them die under them, his or their share or shares will not go over, but will remain with and vest in the survivors, until' all die under such circumstances. If these rules of exposition be correct, then, as the estates given to these sisters are in the present case to go over if all die. after marriage without having issue, the share of one dying thus situated will remain with the surviving sisters; and as all the property to which they are entitled by the will is to go over on that event, the share of one who dies after marriage and without having issue, will vest in the survivors, till the event takes place on which all the estate is to go over. It remains, then, to be proved, that these are the true rules of construction.\nIn 4th Leonard, 14, 32d Eliz., A. devised part of his lands to his eldest son in tail, and the other part to his youngest son in tail, and directed that if any of his sons died without issue, then the whole land should remain to a stranger in fee, and died. The younger son died without issue, and the stranger entered : and it was adjudged that his entry was not lawful, and that the eldest son should have, the land by implicative devise. Another case is reported in Raymond, 452, and is stated in Vinera M. 304, 305, PL 7. Devise to A. and B, his daughters, and their heirs, equally to be divided; and in case they happen to die without issue, then he devised to F, a nephew. One of the sisters dies, her part remains to the surviving sisters; and Pemberton, Chief-Justice, said, the words \u201c if they die without issue,\u201d cannot .be construed otherwise; for then he gives all his lands to F, which imports that both shall come in at one time; which cannot be, till both of the (laughters are dead without issue, unless by the death of one without issue, the other should lose her moiety, which cannot be thought to be the intention of the devisor. Another case is reported in Cowper, Si. Testatrix devised all her undivided moiety to trustees to the use of her husband for life, remainder to her sons to be begotten on her body, and in default of such issue, to the use of all and every the daughter and daughters of P. H. and her the testatrix, lawfully to be begotten, and to the heirs of their body or bodies, if more than one, as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants, ancl for default of such issue, then to the use of her right heir. She died, leaving J. W, her heir at law, and two daughters, Constantia and Catharine. Constantia died at the age of two years, and the question was, Whether on her death without issue, the heir at law was entitled, or whether there were cross-remainders ? The Court said, the limitation over is of the whole estate, limited to \u2022 all the daughters, and is to take place on the failure of all and every the daughter and daughters, and the heirs of their body or bodies 5 and the limitation for default of such issue is to the heir at law. As nothing is to go to the heir whilst any of the daughters or their issue remain, they must amongst themselves take cross-remainders: in other words, the estate of the one dying, went by implication to the survivors. In 4 Term Rep. 711, the devise was t( to all and every the daughters of the body of my daughter Martha, and the heirs male of the bodies of such daughters, equally between them, if more than one, as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants 5 and for default of such issue, all his said premises unto his right heirs, forever. Lord Mansfield said, in default of issue he gives all Ms said premises unto his right heirs, forever he clearly intended, therefore, that the whole should go together. If no cross-remainders be raised between, the daughters, it would go to the right heirs by separate portions, on the death of each. And the Court decided, there were cross-remainders by implication.\nThe cases cited establish the rule, that a devise over' of all upon the event of death after marriage and before issue, will not carry over the estate in parcels ; nor will it, on the death of one under such circumstances, take from the others their shares, so as to give the whole over: but the share of the one so dying will vest by implication in the two surviving. And if such implication will arise on the devise over of all, how much stronger and less liable to doubt, is the case, when that going over is not to be till the death of all, &c. The case here is, \u201c if all die after marriage and before they have issue and this of itself is fully sufficient to raise an implication in favor of the survivors. In 2 Show. 135, \u00cd36, the tes\u00bb tator devised to his two daughters, and if they die without issue, to B. One of them died without issue; and the Court said, here is a plain intention that B. shall have nothing till both children be dead, and it is such an intention as both nature and prudence direct $ and the Court unanimously decided for the surviving daughter. As to the point now under consideration, there is no difference between this case and the one now before the Court, except that in the latter there are three daughters, which at this day makes not the least difference. The doctrine, that there cannot be cross-remainders by necessary implication amongst more than two, is exploded \u2014 Cow. 3\u00cd. In 5 Term 427\", 431, even in the case of a deed, there is a decision against the grantee in the ultimate limitation, because it was only to take place on the death of all the children without issue. In Cowp. 79, the devise was to his two brothers and one sister, and the heirs of their bodies lawfully begotten, and for want of such issue, over. Lord Mansfield and Wilies, Justice, said, there were but few cases which came before the Court where cross-remaimlers are not meant by the testator and/they said, want of issue there plainly-meant issue of all, and decided in favor of the survivors. And may it not be said, in the present case, that the testator did not mean that those in the ultimate limitation should take,*whilst any daughter lived, or any .issue of theirs existed at the death of a surviving daughter ? In the present case, the words are, \u201c if all die not having issue j\u201d in the last case cited, the words were, \u201c and for want of such issue.\u201d' If the meaning of these words was, for \\yant of issue of all, is not the same meaning much more unequivocally expressed in the words, \u201c if all die without issue ?\u201d It fellows, then, that on the death of one not having issue, her part is not to go over, but to remain with the others till they, also, die under the prescribed circumstances. It also follows, that the Complainants, being the surviving sisters, are entitled to the share of their deceased sister Mourning, unless the will of the testator making such a disposition be incompatible with the rules of Law.\nIt is however contended, that the word or, used in the devise, was intended by the testator to be used copu-latively, and signify and, and that the devise really means, \u201c die before eighteen, and before marriage, and having issue thereby and that therefore, the estate of the legatee would be indefeasible until all the events happened, and the estate would be absolute whenever it became impossible for all of them to happen; as if one arrived at eighteen, or if she married or died without leaving issue : whereas, if the sentence is to be read in the disjunctive, if either event happens, the estate of the legatees determines ; that is to say, if either they die before eighteen, or before marriage, or being married, before they have issue thereby. It is true, that there are? cases where or is to be construed and; but they are ca-'1 ses-where the meaning of the testator must be evidently disappointed, unless such construction be adopted : as if land be devised to A. or his heirs, it is clear that the testator intended a fee to A.; but A. cannot have a fee Unless the will be read \u201c to A. and his heirs m,\u201d the Court will, therefore, so construe it, that the evident intention of the testator may not be defeated. JButsuch constructions are not to be adopted, except in cases of evident necessity, and where the meaning of the testator indubitably requires it: not where his meaning is doubtful, much less \"where there is reason to believe that his meaning is expressed and conveyed to us by the disjunctive which he has used. In the present case, there are strong reasons to believe that the testator intended to use the word or in. the disjunctive ; he intended to guard against the imprudent marriages of his daughters before they attained the age of eighteen, and this intention would be entirely defeated if every event mentioned in the will must concur to defeat their estates, that is, dying before eighteen, and before having issue by marriage \u2022 which is the consequence of reading or for and: and notwithstanding the design was to defeat her estate, if one of the daughters married and died under eighteen, yet the very circumstance of marrying under eighteen, will render it indefeasible. In 12 Mod. 276, Jennings devised to his son Thomas, and his heirs forever; \u201c but if it should happen that my said son shall die before he attain the age of twenty-one, or without issue of his body lawfully begotten, then my said land shall be divided between my daughters Mary and Elizabeth.\u201d Thomas, the devisee, arrived to the age of twenty-one, made his will, and died without issue; and itv was insisted for the devisee, that the will of Thomas, the father, should be read thus: \u201c die before twenty-one, and without issuefor said the counsel, otherwise if he have issue before twenty-one, such issue shall not inherit. But Holt, Chief-Justice, answered, there is no necessity to construe or as and, for it might be the design to hinder him from marrying till his age of twenty-one. In 2 Ver. 388, there is another decision of Holt, Chief-Justice, to the like effect. The testator devised a house to his sons James and Thomas; 44 but if any of my said children shall die before twenty-one, or unmarried, his part to go over,\u201d &c. Thomas died after twenty-one, but. unmarried ; and Holt decided, that Ids share went over. Another reason for not construing or as and, is this, that if or be construed copu- latively, and one of the legatees die under eighteen, and also unmarried, and also without issue, the estate will go over; but if she die after eighteen, the estate will have vested in her absolutely. Suppose then, she dies after eighteen, and before marriage, her sisters cannot take the real estate mentioned in this clause of the will, because of their illegitimacy; nor can she devise them to her sisters because of infancy ; and they cannot go over to those in remainder, because the estate vested in her absolutely on her attaining the age of eighteen : the consequence is, it must go to the public, for want of an owner j and so must the personal estate also, if she die intestate. Suppose another event, that one of the daughters attain the age of eighteen, and marries and dies without issue, what is to become of the real estate, if her attaining this age vests the estate absolutely in her ? It cannot go to the husband as tenant by the curtesy, nor c\u00e1n she devise them to her sisters because of her coverture, nor can the estate descend to them because of their illegitimacy. Now the testator did consider of this event, for he has expressed the case of death before marriage and having issue thereby, which certainly means, death without issue, after being married. If he meant that the estate should not be defeated, unless the legatee died both'under eighteen and unmarried, and consequently that marriage before eighteen, should render it absolute in the legatee, then he must have meant to leave the cases of death after eighteen, and before marriage, and death after marriage, and without issue, wholly unprovided for. And are we, against the plain words of a will, which amply provide against such consequences, if understood in their natural and common sense, to presume, that the testator did not understand what he said, to substitute one word for another, and so to let in all the evils which they are calculated to repress ?\nAs to the cases in which or has been construed as and, some of them have been exploded, and those which remain, are clearly distinguishable from this case by this plain circumstance, that there was no perceptible or probable intent of the testator to be disappointed by such construction, nor any inconvenience to be incurred thereby. Whereas, in the present case, the real estate mentioned in this clause of the will, will be exposed to escheat, and the personal estate also, in case of intestacy, and a plain and perceptible intent of great moment defeated, if such construction prevail. The ca,4e of Soule and Gerard, Cro. El. 525, was thus: the testator having four sons, devised to his son Richard and his heirs forever i and if he died within the age of twenty-one, or without issue, the land to be equally divided between his other three sons. Richard, the devisee, liad issue Mary, and died before, coming to the age of twenty-one ; and the Court decided that Richard had an estate-tail; whereas the construction now contended for by the Defendants, would have given a fee, determinable on the contingency of death before twenty-one, and without issue. This case, however, is denied to be law, by Holt, Chief-Jus-! tice, in 12 Mod. 277. And in 2 Fern. 377, there is a case cited, where, upon a special verdict, it was determined upon the same words, that if the son die before twenty-one, although he leave issue, that issue shall not take ; which is to read the will as it stands. In 3 Jltk. 194, Walsh v. Peterson, the testator gave to his son Matthew an estate in fee; \u201c but in case he shall happen to die before he shall attain the age of twenty-one, or without issue, then over.\u201d The sou died after twenty-one, and without issue; and it was decided that the estate did not go over, because both contingencies did not happen, which is tantamount to saying, he must die before twenty-one, and before he has issue. The devisee was an only son, and there was nothing in the will, nor in the circumstances of the devisee, to obviate the presumption that the testator did not mean to leave the issue born before twenty-one, without provision. In the case cited, if the issue did not take, the estate would have gone to stran gers from the blood of the testator, which no-doubt, strengthened the presumption $ but in the present case, if the issue born before eighteen shall not take, the estate wj]j g0 to the two surving daughters of the testator. In. 3 Mk. 390, the testator gave to his son A. in fee, \u201c and in case he shall happen to die in his minority, and unmarried, or without issue, then over.\u201d The devisee came of age and married, but died without issue; and the Court decided that the estate did not go over, because he did not die under age and unmarried, nor unmarried and without issue. Here, by the words of the will, two circumstances in the conjunctive were to concur, death under twenty-one and being unmarried, and no change necessary. Next came the words, or without issue ; and they were construed to mean, or dcatJi without issue under twenty-one. They were not construed to mean three concurring contingencies, death under twenty-one, un \u2022 married, and without issue. So it is no precedent for changing or into and: and the Court said it was no way like the case of Soule and Gerard, which is the leading ease, and always cited upon such occasions. Another case is in 2 Stra. 1175, \u201c I give, &c. to my grandson ill fee, but in case he dies before he attains the age of twenty-one, or marriage and without issue, then over.\u201d The devisee attained twenty-one, and died unmarried: the Court said, they would read the will, \u201c if he died under twenty-one, unmarried, and without issue.\u201d The Court did not go upon the ground, that the issue born, before twenty-one, would, without this construction, be disinherited ; but inclined to this construction, as the contingency was in defeasance of an estate: and there does not appear to be a single case, save that in 3 Mk. 194, where the Court adopted the construction upon the ground that otherwise the issue born before twenty-one, would be dis-inhei\u2019ited ; and in the case in Mk. the intent in their fa-vour could not be mistaken. The last case in 3 T. Bep. 470 \u2014 in that case, if the Court had not construed or as and, cither a life-estate given in the same' instrument, would have been defeated, or the estate in remainder must have been void : so there was an absolute necessity, thus to construe the instrument.\nFrom these views of the case, the conclusions are, that the estate is to go over to the ultimate devisee, not before all the daughters die before eighteen, or before leaving issue by marriage ; that if one dies before having issue by marriage, her part goes over to her surviving sisters, by a necessary implication in the will, arising from the words \u201c if all die, then all the estate to go over.\u201d And such disposition being to take place in a reasonable time, is a legal one\u2019; and that there is nothing to hinder the surviving sisters from taking, according to the intent of the testator.\nBrowne, for the Defendants.\nIn the construction of every will, the principal thing to be considered is, the intention of the testator, and when that is ascertained, it must be carried into effect, if consistent with the rules of Law. This intention is to be ascertained from the words which the testator makes use of, and 'the circumstances of himself and the legatees, as far as they are disclosed to the Court, either expressly or by fair implication. The only circumstance expressly stated in the bill is, that the first legatees were the infant illegitimate daughters of the testator. From the considerable specific legacies devised to these illegitimate children ; from their being made residuary legatees, and from other children not being mentioned even as ulterior devisees, it may be fairly implied, that he had no legitimate children. From his mentioning the two eldest of these daughters coming of age at the same time, it will follow that they were twins; and from the. ulterior devisees not being of his name, or mentioned by any term of relationship, it may reasonably be presumed, that they were strangers to his blood and family. The object to be avoided would be. the chance of the, property\u2019s vesting in the State, by one or more of the legatees dying before any one should be capable of taking it under the statute of distributions, or the legatee herself should be of sufficient age to dispose of it by will. This risk would be sufficiently guarded against, by devising it over in case one or more of them died before she or they either married or attained eighteen years of age $ for if one of them married, then her property would vest in her husband; or, if one of them attained eighteen years of age, then sl\\e might certainly devise it, although it be doubtful whether she could do it before.\nSupposing these to be the probable objects and intentions of the testator, we will proceed to an examination of that clause of his will set forth in the Complainants\u2019 bill. In the first part of that clause, the property now in question being personal estate, is absolutely bequeathed to his three daughters, to be equally divided between them when the two eldest (twins) arrive at the age of eighteen, or many, (whichever event first, happens.) \u201c But if either of the said children, Mourning Thomas, Margaret Thomas, and Temperance Thomas Jackson, should die before they arrive at the age of eighteen years, or marry, then &c. But if all my daughters, &c. should die before they arrive at the age 'of eighteen years, or marries, and has issue thereby, then &c.\u201d If the testator had stopped at the devise over to the survivors incase of one dying before she arrived at the age of eighteen years, or married, then, unquestionably, the devise over could not have taken effect; for Mourning both arrived at the age of eighteen years and married. But it is said, that the whole being devised over in case of all dying before they arrive at the age of eighteen years, or marry and have issue thereby, shews that the testator intended that if all his daughters died before they arrived at eighteen years of age, or before they married and hadnssue thereby, the whole should go over to Bennett Boddie, &c. \u2014 and also intended that the whole should be kept together until-it should be ascertained whether that event should happen or not; and that cross-remainders between the daughters were thus raised by implication, to take effect if any one or two of them died either under eighteen years of age, or before being married and having issue thereby. On this position the argument for the Complainant seems to rest ; and to this it is answered,\n1st. That even if the contingency on which the Restate is devised over to Bennett Boddie, Ac. is such as Complainants contend for, still cross-remainders between the daughters could not be raised by implication; and\n2dly. That the contingency on which the estate is devised over to Bennett Boddie, Ac. is not such as they contend for.\nAs to the first point, it may be admitted that the general position laid down for Complainants concerning raising cross-remainders is correct; and also that the law is now settled \u201c that where cross-remainders are to he raised by implication between two and no more, the presumption is in favor of cross-remainders: Where they are to be raised between more than two, there the presumption is against cross-remainders: but (hat presumption may he answered by circumstances of plain and manifest intention either way.\u201d But the cases of cross-remainders to be met writh in the books, are where property has been devised to two or more as tenants in common for a limited time, as for life, or in tail, without any express remainder between them, and then on the death of all, or the. failure of issue of all, the whole is devised over. In these cases it has been held, that when the estate of one of the first devisees hath been clearly spent, by his death, or the extinction of his issue, then the survivor or survivors, or liis or their issue, should take by cross-remainders, by implication. But her\u00a9 there is an express cross-remainder between the first de-vjsees> The testator hath expressly and explicitly set \u00bfown on what contingency or contingencies the surviving daughter or daughters were to take; and as neither of these contingencies have happened, they cannot take at all: For in such a case, the Court cannot raise any cross-remainders by implication. , Then the event on which the devise to the first devisee was to cease had clearly happened, and the cross-remainder by implication was to be raised between two, where the presumption is in favor of them. In the case before the Court, it cannot be said that the event on which the devise to Mourning was to cease has clearly happened $ and the cross-remainder by implication is to be raised between three, where the presumption is against them. The general application and force of the maxim of law, which governed in the case just cited, and ought to govern in this, is attested by there being two modes of expressing it. \u201c Expressio unins esl excludo alterius\u201cExpression semper fadt cessare taciturn.\u201d\nAs to the second point, it is insisted that the contingency on which the devise over to Bennett Boddie, &c. was to take place, is not such as is contended for on behalf of the Complainants; but that the words \u201c if all my daughters should die before they arrived at the age of eighteen years, or marries and has issue thereby,\u201d are to be taken copulatively that is, that the daughters must die both before they arrive at the age of eighteen years, and before they many and have issue thereby; that if they either arrived at the age of eighteen years, or married and had issue thereby, the property was to be absolutely vested in them, and not to go over.\nThe testator had, in the first part of the clause, directed that the property' devised to his daughters should be kept together until the two eldest (twins) should arrive at the age of eighteen years or married. What could induce him to do this ? Not because at the age of eighteen years, they were capable of managing their estates ; for the will does not provide for that, nor does the general rule of the law permit it 5 but, because, when they arrived at the age of eighteen years or married, an important change took place in the interest which they had in the property. Their interest in it then became absolute, whereas, before it had been liable to be defeated by their 4cath. Until one of these events happened, it could not be certainly known to whom the property would ultimately belong, or how it would have to be divided. If one of them died before she arrived at the ago of eighteen years or married, then' it was to be equally divided between the survivors: if two of them should die so, then there would be no division at all, because the whole would belong to the survivor ; and if all three should die so, then it was to' be divided between Bennett Boddie, &c. The first direction of the testator, concerning the division of the estate, was to be carried into effect when they arrived at the age of eighteen years or married, whichever first happened ; and in the remaining part of the clause he uses the same words, \u201c arrive at the age of eighteen years, or marries and has issue thereby,\u201d no doubt, with the same intent. They were to have a division made to them, if they arrived at the age of eighteen years or married, and they were to have the absolute property, if they did either the one or the other. And the words of the will, by a very easy reading, will support this construction : \u00ab but if all my daughters should die before they Ceither) arrive at the age of eighteen years, or marries and have issue thereby.\u201d If we extend it to the negative implied, it would b\u00e9, \u201c but /if all my daughters should not die before they arrive at the age of eighteen years, or marry and have issue thereby, then the said property shall belong to them, and not to Bennett Boddie, &c.\u201d It is worthy of remark, that the words here used, are in substance the same as the directions given by Sir Joseph Jekyll, Master of the Rolls, in Read v. Snell; and whether these are the words of the directions, or only the' substance of them given by the reporter, either would probably be more accurate than. this testator; and yet it is manifest that the daughter or daughters were to have the property absolutely, if she or they, either attained the age of twenty-one years or married.\nThe Complainants\u2019 counsel contend, that the words, \u201c die before they arrive at the age of eighteen years, or marry and have issue thereby,\u201d are to be taken disjunc-tively ; that is, that these are two separate and distinct\" contingencies; that on the happening of the one or the other, the devise over is to take effect, although, the other do not happen, if this construction were to prevail, the issue of the daughters, the principal objects of the testator\u2019s affection and bounty, might be disinherited; for one or all of the daughters might marry, have issue and die before eighteen ye\u00e1rs of age, and if the property is to go over because they had no issue, although they attained eighteen years of age and married, so it must go over because they did not attain eighteen years of age, although they married and had issue, which certainly could not be the intention of the testator. A multitude of cases might be cited, to shew that even in (Jeeds, the Court, in order to effectuate the intent of the parties, will change the disjunctive, or into the Copulative and. The same has been done in construing statutes, notwithstanding the deliberate and formal manner of their passing, and the scrupulousness with which their wording is con-sidered So in all formal conveyances, \u201c to have and to hold unto the said A. B. his heirs and assigns,\u201d or <e unto the said A. B. his executors, administrators and assigns.\u201d Such cases, however, need not be resorted to, as the Books furnish a long series of decisions exactly in point, and which establish beyond all contradiction the construction contended for by the Defendants.\nIn 1596, in Soulle v. Gerard, the testator having four sons, devised his land to his \u201c son Richard and his heirs forever; and if Richard died within the age of twenty-one years or without issue, that then the land should be equally divided between his three other sons.5\u2019 Richard had issue, Mary, and died within age. Tiie Court decided that Mary, the daughter of Richard, should have the land, and that the devise over could not take effect unless Richard had died under twenty-one years of age and without issue. Thus changing or into and in order to effectuate the intent of the testator, who certainly VouId not mean to disinherit his grandchild. It is worthy of remark, that in this case the devise over is to the testator\u2019s other sons \u2022, in the case before the Court, it is to strangers.\nIn 1708, in Wright v. Hammond, the devise was to the testator\u2019s daughter \u201cElizabeth, but if my said daughter Elizabeth should die before her mother or without heirs,\u201d then over. Elizabeth, the daughter, outlived her mother, but died without issue. Pratt, Chief-Justice, in delivering the. opinion of the Court, says, \u201cthe contingencies on which the devise over was to take effect, never happened, for the daughter did not die before the mother.\u201d From which it appears that the opinion of the Court was, that or should be changed into and. Why ? Because, if the estate was to go over because Elizabeth the daugtep had not issue, although she outlived her mother, so it must have gone over, if she did'not outlive her mother, although she had died leaving issue, which never could have been the intention of tire testator.\nTherefore the Court held, that her dying before her mother, or without heirs, did not constitute two separate and distinct contingencies, on the happening of either of which the estate should go over$ but that these words made only one contingency, and that the estate should not go over unless she died both before her mother and without heirs.\nIn 1743, in Read v. Snell, Lord Hardwicke, after shewing that there are many cases where or may be construed and, says, \u201c And there is one case in this very will where it must be so construed, and that is in the second codicil, where she gives her wearing apparel to her maid, in case her daughter dies under age or unmarried.\u201d\nIn 1743, Barker v. Suretces, on a writ of error, the question arose upon these words in a will, \u201c I give the said premises to my grandson, his heirs and assigns forever ; But in case he dies before he attains the age of twenty-one years or marriage and without issue,\u201d then over. The grandson attained twenty-one years of age, But died without ever having been married. The Court gave judgment against the ulterior devisee, and said they rwould read the will without the word or, as if it run, \u201c and if he dies before twenty-one, unmarried and without issue.\u201d The reason assigned in support of the last decision upholds this also : and the limitation or contin-gericy in this case, is the very same as in the case before the Court.\nIn 1774, Walch v. Patterson, the testator devised to his son Matthew and his heirs and assigns forever, \u201cBut in case my said son should die before he attain the age of twenty-one years or without issue,\u201d tjien to his the testator\u2019s wife. Matthew died after the age of twenty-one years, but without issue, and the question was, \u201c Whether the devise over to his mother should take effect upon the happening of one of the contingencies only and Lord Hardwicke held it to be a very plain case, that it should not. Jn\u25a0 this case the devise over was to the mother of Matthew, who, it might have been reasonably supposed, would have provided for her children, (her own as well as the testator\u2019s grandchildren,) in case they had been disinherited by the literal construc tion for which the Complainants now contend; which makes it a stronger case than the one now before the Court, where the devise over is to strangers.\nIn 1746, Frammingham v. Brand, testatrix devised to her son Robert and his heirs forever ; \u201c and in case the said Robert my son happen to die in his minority, or unmarried, jer without issue, then I give it to my son Henry and his heirs/\u2019 Robert attained the age of twenty-one years, but died unmarried and without issue.. The Lord Chancellor held, \u201c that this contingent executory devise to Henry could never take place, for both the words or are to be taken in a copulative sense, and unless Robert had died in his minority and unmarried and without issue, Henry could never take: and if this were to be construed otherwise, it might happen that Robert might marry and die leaving issue in his minority, which might be disinherited if the estate was not to vest in him absolutely on his marriage, which could never be the intent of the testator.\u201d\nIn 1750, in Brownsword v. Edwards, Lord Hardwicke again very emphatically recognizes the same doctrine.\nIn 1789, Wright v. Kemp, in the surrender of copy-hold premises, the use was to William Wallace for life, and from and after his decease, to the use of the heirs of his body lawfully to be begotten,\u201d with a proviso, \u201cthat in case William Wallace should die in the life-time of the surrenderor, or Without issue of his body, then to the right heirs of the surrenderor.\u201d William Wallace died in the life-time of the surrenderor, leaving issue. The counsel on both sides refined much, but the good sense of Lord Kenyon and the rest of the Court, contemned all refinement, and founded themselves on the intention of the surrenderor in favor of the issue of William Wallace, and therefore changed or into and, so as to .vest the estate, in the issue of William Wallace.\nIn addition to these authorities, one may be cited from the opinion of the Court of Errors and Appeals of the State of Virginia, delivered in .1798, in the case of Brewer and wife v. Opie. There the devise was to \u201c the testator\u2019s son Joseph, his whole and sole estate, real and personal, and in case my said son should die before the age of twenty-one years, or without lawful heirs,\u201d then over. \u2022 The opinion of the Court was, \u201c that Joseph the son took a contingent fee, to become absolute upon either event happening; that is to say, his coming of age, or having a child born, or leaving one at his death, no matter which. That or, in this will, is to be taken copulatively, so as to require the happening of both contingencies to entitle those in remainder.\u201d\nThe counsel for Complainants have attempted to question the decision in the case of Soulle v. Gerard. In that case, the first devise was to the testator\u2019s son Richard, in fee, and if he died within the age of twenty-one years or without issue, then over: And some of the Judges said that Richard took an estate tail, and that the devise over was a remainder. Since the doctrine of ex-ecutory devises hath been better understood, this position hath been doubted, and it would probably now* be decided that Richard took a defeasible fee, to become absolute on either event happening, and that the devise over was a contingent executory devise, but the propriety of the decision hath never been ^questioned. All the cases cited for the Defendants are in conformity with it.\nThe counsel for Complainants have relied much upon a case reported in 12 Mod. 276, and a case cited in 2 Vern. 377. In truth, the case in 12 Mod. and the case cited in Vernon, are one and the same case, as appears from the names of the parties, although in 2 Vern. it is misstated either by the citer or reporter. The name of this case is Hilliard v. Jennings, and it is reported in 12 Mod. 276, Com. 90, Freem. 509, Lord Raym. 505, and Corth. 514, (whichlastis considered as the best:) and in it the testator devised the lands in question to his son Thomas and his heirs forever. \u201c But if it shall so happen that my said son shall die without issue of his body or before he shall attain the age of twenty-one years,\u201d then, over to his, the testator\u2019s, two daughters. Thomas having attained the age of twenty-one years, made his will in due form of law, and devised those lands to the Plaintiff, who, together with A. B. were subscribing witnesses to said will, and then Thomas died without issue. All this being found by special verdict, two questions arose, 1st, Whether the said will was duly attested under the statute of frauds ; and 2dly, Whether the absolute fee-simple was vested in Thomas by his arriving at ..twenty-one years of age. The Court gave judgment for the Defendant on the first point, as appears from Carthew, who does not even take notice of the loose conversation of Lord Holt, on which the Defendants so much rely, but only reports the other point. 13 Mod. also shews, that the cause was decided about the attestation of the will \u2022, and it appears from Ld. Raym. 505\u20141 P. Wms. 557 \u20141 Bl. Rep. 101, that the Court did not determine the other point. Also, Powell, Justice, four years afterwards, 2 Vern. 377, cites the case of Soulle \u2022v. Gerard, as good law, which he could not have done, if it had been overruled in the case of Hilliard v. Jennings. So Pratt, Chief-Justice, who argued the case of Hilliard v. Jennings for the devisee, more than nine years afterwards, in 1 Strange 427, delivers the same doctrine as that laid down in Soulle v. Gerard, without taking any notice of the case of Hilliard v. Jennings. Nor has it ever been cited as an authority affecting the point\u2019 how before the Court, in any of the numerous cases determined since it occurred;\nThe case of Woodward v. Glassbrook, has been cited for the Complainants. That case in substance was, that the testator devised to his son Thomas in tail, but if Thomas should die before twenty-one years of age, or un-then over. Thomas died unmarried, but aftfer jic attained twcnty-o\u2019nc years of age; and it was decided that the devise over should take effect. Neither the arguments of counsel, nor the reasons for the opinion of the Coui*.t arc giveu. This is a solitary case decided by one Judge at Nisi Frius, and reported by a gentleman in a great practice, who took notes only for his own use, which were published, perhaps imprudently, after his death. They are frequently found to be very incorrect 5 but if this case be correctly reported, we can only say, that the decisions for a century before, and for a century since, have been uniformly in opposition to it ,\u2022 nor has it ever been cited or relied on in any of the cases on this subject, which have constantly overruled it.\nSwinb. 67, Co.

A literal construction of the will would not effectuate this intention ,* for then, a dying under eighteen years of age, although the daughter was married, or a dying without marriage, although she had attained the age of eighteen years, would give her share over to the survivors. If the word or is construed copulatively, then the survivors can claim the share of the deceased only upon the event of her liaving died unmarried and under eighteen. But Mourning having reached the age of eighteen, and having also manned, there is not the least right in the Complainants. To shew- that the will ougi* to be thus construed, .the cases cited in the case of Dickenson and others v. Jordan and Blount, decided at this term, clearly prove. Another clause of the will provides, that in the event of the death of his daughters und\u00e9r the age of eighteen years, or manage and having issue thereby, the estate shall go over to so pic oilier persons therein named. It is certainly a sound rule of construction, that every part of a will shall be taken into vjew, in order to ascertain the design of the maker; andthis clause seems to shew more clearly, that the intention of the testator would not be accomplished by adapting the construction contended for by the Complainants; for then the claim of the issue of a daughter dying under eighteen might have been defeated, which cannot be thought to have been wished or contemplated.by the testator, who has called distant relations into the sphere of his bounty, only upon a total failure of all those circumstances, upon the happening of which, he meant the shares of his daughters respectively to rest so as to become absolute.\nIn borrowing light from the clause of the will, we must keep in mind this important fact, that the, same construction which would entitle the Complainants to their deceased sister\u2019s share of the estate, must be equally operative to transfer their own shares to the ulterior legatees. The Court cannot now decree in favour of the Complainants, on the ground of Mourning having died without issue, and hereafter refuse to sustain a bill in favour of the rest of the legatees, in the event of the Complainants dying without issue. Moreover, if the Complainants had died under the age of eighteen years, leaving issue, the same construction must have taken the estate from that issue and given it to these distant relations, if they are relations at all; for it does not appear that more than two of them are connected with the testator. Upon the whole, the Court are of opinion, that the occurrence of either event, to wit, attaining the age of eighteen years, marriage and having issue thereby, was sufficient to vest the shares absolutely in the daughters ; and that consequently nothing short of the failure of all these events would vest the share of a deceased daughter in the survivors, or in the residuary legatees upon the death of the daughters. \u2014 Let the demurrer be sustained.", "author": "Tatuoh, Judge,", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["Alston and wife and others v.

The point reserved was sent to thi^ Court; and ,", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "Tatxoe., Judge,\ndelivered the opinion of the Court:\nThe contract between the parties is stated at length in the special case, and appears to be both formally and substantially a bill of sale in all respects, except as to the want of a seal. This, omission, however, is so important in the legal estimation of the paper, that it cannot be classed amongst specialties, but must remain a simple contract, on which no additional validity can be conferred by the subsequent registration. For 1 do not apprehend that any legal effect can be given to a paper by recording it, if that ceremony were not required by law.\nIt might not, however, be an useless enquiry to consider, whether a paper containing nearly all the component parts of a specialty or deed, does not advance some greater claims to be respected in the scale of evidence, than such proofs of a contract as rest upon the memory of witnesses.\nThe solemnity of sealed instruments has been, from the earliest periods of the Law, highly regarded ; because the forms and ceremonies which accompany them, bespeak deliberation in the parties, and afford a safe ground for Courts and Juries to ascertain and settle contested rights. This deliberation is inferred, not from any one circumstance attending the transaction, but as the general effect of the whole. Thus in Plowd. 308, B. \u201c It is said that deeds are received as a lien final to the party making them, although he received no consideration, in respect of the deliberate mode in which they are supposed to he made and executed ; for, first, tiie deed is prepared and drawn; then, the seal is affixed ; and lastly, the contracting party delivers it, which is the con-spmination of iiis resolution.\u201d Hence it appears, that the law gives to deeds a respect and importance which it denies to any other contracts ; not an empty and unmeaning respect, but such as properly arises from the existence of all those circumstances which are calculated to fix and make authentic the contracts of men.\nA contract cannot he a deed, if either it is not prepared and drawn; if the seal be not affixed, or if it be not delivered ; but still if tiie deliberation is inferred from all these circumstances, it is fair reasoning to presume some degree of deliberation from any one or two of them, and to give to the. papey, when it is introduced as evidence of tiie parties\u2019 transaction, precisely such credence as belongs to it, from its partaking more or less of the nature of a deed.\nTo give this rule a practical application to the case before us, tiie conclusion would be, tiiat as the paper is without a seal, it cannot be a deed, and is therefore not decisive evidence as that instrument is ; it is not a final lien ; but as it possesses some of the essentials of a deed, viz. a formal draught and delivery, so far it shall be regarded as evidence of no slight nature of the fact it is introduced to establish.\nThe writers on tiie Law of Evidence have accordingly, in arranging the degrees of proof, placed written evidence of every kind higher in tiie scale of probability than unwritten ,\u2022 and notwithstanding the splendid elo quence of Cicero, to the contrary, in his declamation for the poet Arrhias, the sages of our Law have said that the \u25a0fallibility of human memory weakens the effect of that testimony which the most upright mind, awfully impressed with the solemnity of an oath, may be disposed to give. Time wears away the distinct image and clear iniprcsmi n r-f \u00fc\u00a1e fact, and leaves in the mind, uncertain opinions, ;rfert notions and vague surmises.\nIt is, however, contended by the Plaintiffs, that contracts by our law are distinguished by specialty and by parol; that there is no third kind, and that whatever is nof a specialty, though it be in writing, is by parol. To establish this position, a case is cited from 7 Term Rep. 350, by which it is certainly proved. But the position being established, whether it will authorise the inference that parol evidence is admissible to vary and extend written evidence, will best appear from an examination of the case, and from some attention to the question which called for the solution of the Court.\nIn the case cited, the declaration states, that the Defendant, being indebted as administratrix, promised to pay when requested, and the judgment is against her generally. From this statement it is manifest, that the promise could not be. extended beyond the consideration which was in another right as administratrix, and made to bind the Defendant personally. But in order to avoid this objection, it was contended, that the promise being reduced to writing, the necessity of a,consideration was dispensed with ; and that the fact of its having been made in writing, might well be presumed after verdict, if necessary to support the verdict, which Liter position was conceded by the Court. \u2019\nIt is, then, perfectly evident, that the only question iu the case was, whether midum pactum could' be alleged against a contract in writing, but without seal ? That it could not, had been a notion entertained by several eminent men, and amongst the rest by the learned com mentator, who observes, that \u201c every bond, from the solemnity of the instrument, and every note, from thesub-scription of the drawer, carries with it interna! evidence 0f a g00d consideration.\u201d This, doctrine, however, is inaccurate as applied to notes, when a suit is brought by the payee, and is only correct as between the indorsee and drawer. To demonstrate the propriety of the objection, it became necessary for the Court, in Ram v. Hughes, to enter into a definition and classification of contracts, into those by specialty and those, by parol; to which latter division every contract belongs that is not sealed, though it may be written. Every written unsealed contract is, therefore, in the strict language of legal precision, a parol contract, and like all others, must be supported by a consideration.\nBut let it be considered, what the Court would have said, if the case, instead of requiring them to give a precise and comprehensive definition of contracts, had called upon them for a description of the evidence by whicl} contracts may be supported. They would, 1 apprehend, have said, (because the law says so,) the evidence which may be adduced in proof of a contract is threefold : 1st. Matter of record : 2d. Specialty : 3d. Unsealed written evidence, or oral testimony. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between a contract, and the evidence of a contract, for though they may be, and are, in many cases, identified ; yet in legal language, a parol contract may be proved by written evidence. This is the case now before us, and this brings me to the question it presents, which I understand to be, Whether oral evidence is proper to extend and enlarge a contract which the parties have committed to writing? The first reflection that'occurs to the mind upon the statement of the question, independent of any technical rules, is, that the parties, by making a written memorial of their transaction, have implicitly agreed, that in the event of any future misunderstanding, that writing shall be referred to, as the proof of their act and intention : that such obligations as arose from the paper, by just construction or legal intendment, should be valid and compulsory on them; but that they would not subject themselves to any stipulations beyond their contract; because, if they meant to be bound by any such, they might have added them to the writing; and thus have given them a clearness, a force, and a direction, which they could not have by being trusted to the memory of a witness. For this end, the paper is signed, is witnessed, and is mistakenly recorded. But the Plaintiff says, besides the warranty of title contained in the writing, the Defendant made me another warranty as to the quality, which 1 can prove by a witness present at the time ; and though he has complied with the warranty which was committed to writing, yet he has broken the one which was orally made, whence 1 am injured and seek compensation.\nWe are then to decide, Whether the law deems such proof admissible?\nBy the Common Law of England, there were but few contracts necessary to be made in writing. Property lying in grant, as rights and future interests, and that sort of real property, to which the term incorporeal here-ditament applies, must have been'\u2019authenticated by deed. So the. law remained until the stat. 32 II. 8, which, permitting a partial disposition of land by will, required the will to be in writing; but estates in land might still be conveyed by a symbolical delivery in presence of the neighbors, without any written instrument j though it was thought prudent to add security to the transaction by the charter of feoffment. The statute of 29 Car. 2, commonly called the statute of frauds, has made writing and signing essential in a great variety of cases wherein they were not so before, and has certainly increased the necessity of caution in the English Courts, with respect to the admission of verbal testimony, to add to or alter written instruments, in cases coming within the provi- fiions of that statute. That law being posterior to the date- of the charter under which this State was settled, has never had operation here ; so that the Common Law remained unaltered until the year 1715, when a partial enactment was made cf the provisions of the English statute.\nThe law must therefore be sought for in cases arising before the statute, of frauds, and expositions upon that statute are no otherwise authoritative than as they affirm or recognize the ancient law. Rut I believe there can be no doubt that tiie rule is as ancient as any in the law of evidence, and that it existed before the necessity of reducing any act into writing was introduced.\nIn Plowden, 345, Lord Dyer remarks, \u201c men\u2019s deeds and wills, by which they settle their estates, are the laws which private men are allowed to make, and they are not to be altered even by the King, in Ids Courts of Law or conscience.\u201d\nIn Rutland's case, 5 Coke, the Court resolved that it was very inconvenient that matters in writing should be controlled by averment of parties, to be proved by uncertain testimony of slippery memory, and should be perilous to purchasers, farmers, vtc.\nThe c\u00e1se of Meres & al. v. Ansel and others, in 3 Wilson, 275, is directly in point upon the general principle, to shew that parol evidence shall not be admitted to contradict, disannul or substantially vary a written agreement.\nIn 2 Atkins, 384, Lord Hardwicke says, \u201c it is not only contrary to the statute but to Common Law, to add any thing to a written agreement by parol evidence.\u201d\nAH written contracts, says Justice Ashurst, whether % deed or not, are intended to be standing evidence against the parties entering into them \u2014 4 Term Rep. 331.\n1st Ves.jr. 241, parol evidence to prove an agreement made upon the purchase of an annuity that it was redeemable, was rejected.\nIn a very recent case, in 7 Ves. 211, we are furnished With the opinion of the present Master of the Rolls, Sir William Grant, than whom no Judge ever ranked higher in the estimation of his contemporaries, for profound and accurate knowledge in legal science, and a proper and discriminating application of well grounded principles to the cases which arise in judgment before him. His observations are, \u201c By the rule of Law, independent of the statute, parol evidence cannot be received to contradict a written agreement. To admit it for the purpose of proving that the written instrument does not contain the real agreement, would be the same as receiving it for every purpose. It was for the purpose of shutting out that enquiry that the rule was adopted. Though the written instrument does not contain 4he terms, it must in contemplation of law, be taken to contain the' agreement, as furnishing better evidence than any parol can supply.\u201d\nTo these authorities, I will add a decision of the Circuit Court of Pennsylvania, because it appears to be in principle the very case under consideration.\nAn action on the case was brought by the assignee of a bond against the assignor, upon a written assignment in general terms. The Plaintiffs offered oral evidence to shew that the Defendant had expressly guaranteed the payment of the bond. \u201c Chase, Justice \u2014 You may explain, but you cannot alter a written contract by parol testimony. A case of explanation implies uncertainty, ambiguity and doubt upon the face of the instrument.\nBut the proposition now is a plain case of alteration : that is, an offer to prove by witnesses, that the assignor promised something beyond the plain words and meaning of his written contract. Such evidence is inadmissible- and has been so adjudged in the Supreme Court, in Clark v. Russell, 3 Dal. 415. I grant that Chancery will not confine itself to the strict rule, in cases of fraud, and of trust: hut we are sitting as Judges at Common Paw. and I can perceive, no reason to depart from it.\u201d\nI suppose the above authorities are amply sufficient to establish the proposition for which they are cited, and therefore I forbear to make any other references for that purpose. The exceptions to the general rule may be comprised under the heads of fraud, surprise, mistake, in cases of resulting trust, to rebut an equity, or to explain latent ambiguities \u2022, and there may also be some other cases which cannot be properly ranged under the titles specified. But as the case stated is, in my opinion, directly opposed by the general rule, so far as it seeks to establish the proof of warranty as to quality, by parol, and presents no fact to bring it within any of the exceptions, it would be needless to multiply authorities with respect to them.\nAs to the exception on the ground of fraud, \u00cd conceive that only occurs, where something intended to have been inserted in the contract, is omitted through the misrepresentation or unfair practice of one of the parties. In sucji case, the omission may he supplied by parol evidence. But there is no allegation here that the additional warranty was intended or understood by either party to have been inserted in the agreement.\nIt is also necessary to attend to the nature of the remedy adopted by the Plaintiffs in this case, which is founded on the warranty, and is in assumpsit. The questions arising upon the general issue are, whether the warranty was made, and whether it was true at the time of making. For if the warranty were made, and not complied wfith, it is wholly immaterial whether the defect was known to the seller or not, a principle that seems to extend to every case where the Plaintiff\" proceeds on the warranty. But in an action of deceit, the scienter or fraud is a material part of the declaration, and must be brought home to the Defendant to authorise a recovery against him, and in such case it seems from the authorities, that proofs of the fraudulent conduct of the Defendant may be drawn from sources dehors the written contract. It cannot be contended, that inserting the scienter in a declaration on the warranty, will convert it into an action of deceit founded on tort. In the latter action, the knowledge of the Defendant, or something equivalent to it by which the fraud is charged, is a substantive allegation, and must he proved \u2022, in the former, it is merely surplusage, and may be rejected.", "author": "Tatxoe., Judge,", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["Daniel Smith v.

Hyder A. Davie and wife, and Harwood Jones.\n1 b>From Northampton.\nA. devised his manor plantation to his son B, in trust, to apply and pay-over the rents and profits to another son, C, during his life, and after the death of C, he devised tile plantation to B. in fee-simple. In the year 1790, B. conveyed the plantation to C. in fee, with proviso, \u201c that if C. should die without a child or children, the plantation shoixld revert to B. and his heirs.\u201d B. died in 1794, intestate, leaving two children, D. a son, and E. a daughter. At the time of his death, D. Ids son was heir at law. In 1795, the Legislature declared that sisters should be admitted to inherit lands equally with the brothers, to hold with the brothers as tenants in common. Ini 1798, C. died without leaving any child; and a question arose, Whether D. who was the hen- of his father at the time of the descent, or D. and E. who were the heirs at law at the time the rever-sionary interest of the father fell into possession, were entitled to the rents and profits of the plantation.\nHeld, that E. was entitled equally with D.; for whoever claims a fee-, simple by descent from one who was first purchaser of the remainder or reversion expectant on a freehold estate, must make himself hem to such purchaser at the time when such remainder or reversion falls into possession. s\nAnd the pleadings in a writ of Formedon in Remainder or Reverter, shew that he who is heir at the time of the contingency happening and the lands falling into possession, is to take, and not he that ^5 heir at the death of the first purchaser or donor.. For in Formedon in Descender, file Court stating the\u201egifl to the first donee, expressly avers a descent from him to A, his son and heir, then to B, his son and heir, and then to the Demandant, his son and heir. But in For-, medonin Remainder and Reverter, the Court only avers the happening of the contingency on which the lands were to go over or revert, and that on its happening, the lands ought to go over or revert to the Demandant, who now claims as cousin and heir of the first purchaser or donor.\n*The interest of the first purchaser of a remainder in fee, or the donor of a reverter in fee, is to him and his heirs forever; and on his death. whatever interest vests in his heir, is to him and Ms heirs forever. This interest, although vesting in the heir of the first purchaser or donor and his heirs, is subject to be dives! ed out of his heirs by any subsequent event which makes them not heirs to the first purchaser or donor at the lime when the reversion falls in. As the law of descents has not been changed in England, the books shew no case decided there, in which the estate has by any subsequent event been divested out of the heir of the first purchaser or donor in whom it has once vested; and therefore, if the remainder or reversion once vested in him, he continued to be heir to the first purchaser or donor at the falling in- of the reversion, if he so long lived: but such heir does not take an interest to himself and another to his heirs; and as the interest which he takes to his heirs is liable to be divested by subsequent event-', making his heirs not heirs to the first purchaser or donor at the time when the remainder or reversion falls into posses-sibn, so his interest may be divested by a public and general law, making Aim not heir to the first purchaser or donor at the time when the remainder or reversion falls in.\nfiiere the reversionarj interest fell in in 1798, at which time the act of 1795 had made 1). not the sole heir to the donor, and had declared that D. and E. should then be considered heirs to him. And it is a common case in lav/ for lands to vest in one sub modo only, so as to be divested by a subsequent event, and vested in another. It occurs,\n1. Ex instilutione legis in every instance where on the death of a tenant in fee or in tail, his lands descend to his daughter, uncle, &c.\"and afterwards a son is born, who shall enter upon the daughter, &c. and divest the estate which she took by descent.\n2. Ex provisione hominis ; as where lands are settled or devised to the Use of the husband and wife for life, remainder to such one or more of their children as they shall appoint; and in default of such appointment to all their children as tenants in common. There on the birth of one child, the remainder vests solely in it; but on the birth of the second child, one moiety of the remainder is divested out of the first child, and vested in the second, and so on loties quo-\u25a0lies ; and if the father and mother make an appointment, then the whole remainder is divested out of the children as' tenants in common, and vested according to the appointment.\nSo if on the death o\u00ed' B. an interest vested in his son 11, one moiety of that interest was divested by the act of 1795, and 1). and E. became entitled each to a moiety of the lands, and of course to a moiety of the profits.\nHarwood Jones devised his \u201c manor plantation, and all the lands adjoining the same, to his son John Jones, in trust, to apply and pay over anuually the rents and profits of the same to the use of another son, Harwood Jones, for and during his natural life; and after the death of the-said Harwood, (the son,) to John in fee sim-pie.\u201d In the year 1790, and shortly after the death of Harwood Jones, the devisor, John Jones conveyed the \u2022said manor plantation to his brother Harwood Jones, in fee, y?ith a proviso, \u201cthat if the said Harwood Jones should die without a child or children, the said manor plantation should revert to the said John Jones- and his heirs.\u201d Harwood Jones died in 1798, without leaving any child or children, or the issue of such : and John Jones died in the year 1794, intestate, leaving two children, Harwood, and Elizabeth, since intermarried with Hyder A. Davie. James Exum was appointed guardian to the said Harwood and Elizabeth, and received the rents and profits of the said manor plantation ; and not being able to determine who was entitled to the said rents and profits : whether they belonged exclusively to Har-wood, or were to be divided between him and his sister Elizabeth ; and as Mr. Davie, in right of his wife Elizabeth, claimed a riioiety of the rents and profits, he filed this bill in the Court of Equity for Northampton county, against Harwood Jones, and Hyder A. Davie and Elizabeth his wife, to compel them to interplead, settle and adjust their rights and demands, between themselves, so that he might be enabled to pay the said rents and profits with safety to himself. He appended to his bill the. usual affidavit that he did not file the bill in collusion with either of the Defendants, but from a desire to avoid being doubly vexed concerning the matters contained therein.\nThe Defendants put in their answers ; Harwood Jones insisting that the whole rents and profits belonged to him ; and Hyder A. Davie and wife insisting that one moiety thereof belonged to them. The case was sent to this Court upon the bill and answers, for the opinion of the Judges. The case was argued by Fitts for Harwood Jones, and by Browne for Hyder A. Davie and wife.\nThe argument relied upon for Harwood Jones is noticed by Browne in his. argument for Davie and wife.\nBrowne, for Davie and wife\nThe first questions which present themselves in this case, are, 1st. Whether the heirs pf John Jones are entitled to the lands, the profits of which are now in controversy ? and 2dly, if they be entitled, Who are his heirs ?\nBy the will of Harwood Jones the elder, his son Har-wood Jones was tenant for life, with a clear remainder to his other son John Jones. But John Jones, by de(ed of bargain and sale, conveyed the said lands to his brother Harwood in fee, \u201cProvided nevertheless and upon thi^ express condition, that if the said Harwood Jones sliou,ld depart this life without a legitimate child or children, then and in that case, the said lands, &c. are to revert to and become the property of the said John Jones, bis heirs and assigns for ever, in as full and ample a manner, to all intents and purposes, as if this present indenture had never been made.\u201d if this had been a feoffment or other common Law conveyance, the feoffee would have taken a fee-simple on condition. \u2014 Co. Lit. 203, a\u2014 204, 331, 371, 372. And on his dying without child or children, the feoffdr might have entered and been seised of his former estate. \u2014 Co. Lit. 325,. 202, a.\nA condition may either confirm or defeat a fee-simple. Co. Lit. 207, a.\nBut this conveyance was a bargain and sale to operate by the statute of uses \u2014 2 Bl. Com. 338 ; and on such conveyance a fee may be limited on a fee,, provided the contingency on which it is so limited'is not too remote. The Duke of Norfolk\u2019s case arose on a deed, and was a springing trust after an estate-tail in a term. ,An estate-tail in a term gives the wholeinterest therein, because it cannot be docked by fine Or recovery, and so tends evidently to a perpetuity. A common recovery suffered by tenant in tail barred all remainders and reversions on account of the supposed recompense. But conditions, conditional limitations, shifting uses and trusts, resulting uses and trusts, &c. which were only to have operation after the termination of a fee-simple, being of no value in the eye of the law, no recompense was awarded them, and therefore, they were not bound on that ground $ but on the absurd notion that the recoverer was in of the estate-tail, which, in contemplation of law, will ever continue to subsist. But a recovery by tenant in fee-simple did not bar them; for lie having the whole estate would be entitled to the whole recompense, and there being no previous estate-tail, there was no room for the notion of its continuing to subsist. This is the foundation of the rule limiting them to take eifect within a life in being and twenty-one years after.\nIn the case before the Court, the bargainee was tenant in fee-simple, and no recovery has or could have been suffered. It is therefore submitted that the heirs of John Jones are clearly entitled to the lands, the profits of which are in dispute in this case.\nThe second question is, Who are the heirs of John Jones entitled to these lands ? At the death of John Jones, his son was his sole heir: but at the death of Har-wood Jones the bargainee in 1798, when the reversion-' ary interest of the said John fell into possession, bis son and his daughter were equally entitled: and the question is, Whether the son who was heir at the death of his father John, or the son and daughter who were the heirs at law at the death of Harwood the bargainee, and the falling into possession of the reversionary interest are to take.\nWhoever claims a fee simple by descent from one who was first purchaser of the remainder or reversion expcc-tant on a freehold estate, must make himself heir to such purchaser at the time when such remainder or reversion falls into possession : and although the particular reason given in the case in Willson, against the Plaintiff, was, that she was not of the blood of the first purchaser, yet that would not govern the case from Lord Coke, as the father and the sister of the whole blood were of the blood of the first purchaser. It must therefore be the general one assigned by Fearne, \u201c that she was not heir at the time of the contingency happening, and the .estate falling into possession.\u201d\nIn Formedon in Descender, the Court stating the gift to the first donee, expressly avers a descent from him to A, his son and heir, then to R, his son and heir, and then to-thc demandant, his son and heir. But in Formedon in the Remainder and Reverter, the Court only avers the happening of the contingency on which the lands were to go over or revert; and that on its happening, the lands ought to go over or revert to the demandant, who now claims as cousin and heir of the first purchaser or donor \\ and only under a scilicet shews how he is cousin and heir. What is laid under a 4idelicet is mere form, not traversable by the Defendant; nor is the Plaintiff obliged to prove it, but may support ids general allegation of being cousin and heir by proof of any other facts. As the accuracy and scrupulous precision of ancient pleading, and the necessity that a party was under of averring every thing material to his claim, are well known, and as the demandant in remainder or reversion only averred that at the time the contingency happened and the lands were to come into possession, he was heir to the first purchaser or donor, these precedents appear to be strong evidence, that he who was heir at the time of the contingency happening and the lands falling into possession, was to take ; aud not he that was heir at the death of the first purchaser or donor, or those claiming under Mm. The same doctrine is strongly laid down by Brampton, Chief-Justice, and Berkley, Justice, in Cro. Car. 411, and agreed to by Jones and Croke, Justices, although they differed from the others in the determination of that case upon the custom. But Croke reports himself and Jones as having said, \u201c If lands vest in an heir by reason of a contingency, although another heir more near comes in esse, it shall never be divested $ and he who will afier claim ought to claim from him in whom the estate vested.\u201d The two cases which they citd in support of this doctrine, arc both stated in 1 Co. 65, a. and shew that by the term \u201c vest\u201d they meant vesting in possession on the happening of the contingency. Indeed, they could mean nothing else, for an interest, while it depends on a contingency, is not a vested interest, and is therefore called contingent. So that this doctrine has no bearing on the case now before the Court. Both cases are, however, well explained,, and the dictum itself shewn, not to be Law, in 1 Co. 69, a\u2014Cro. Car. 87\u2014Mob. 3\u20143 Co. 61, b.\nThe interest of the first purchaser of a remainder in fee, or the donor of a reverter in fee, is to him and his heirs forever ; and on his death, whatever interest vests in his heir, is to him and his heirs forever. But the cases already cited, shew that this interest, although vesting in the heir of the first, purchaser or donor and his heirs, is subject to bo divested by any subsequent event which makes them not heirs to the first purchaser or donor at the time when the reversion falls in. It is true, that none of these cases shew that the estate may, by a subsequent event, be divested out of an heir of the first purchaser or donor, in whom it has once vested j but only that it shall not descend from such heir to his heirs, which must be owing to the law of descent\u2019s never hav ing been changed in England since we have any reports of cases decided there : and therefore, if the remainder or reversion once vested in a person, as heir of the first purchaser or donor, ho continued to be heir to the first purchaser or donor at the falling in of the reversion, if he so long lived : but such heir does not take an interest to himself and another to his heirs ; and if the interest which he takes to his heirs is liable to be divested, and has been divested by subsequent events, making his heirs not heirs \u00a1o the first purchaser or donor at the time when the reversion or remainder fell into possession, why should not his interest be liable to be divested and actually be divested by a subsequent event, (the passing of a public, and general law,) making him not heir to the donor or first purchaser at the time when the reversion or remainder fell into possession ?\nIt, is impossible to ascertain wiien this rule of Law was first established; but it was probably after that which, in opposition to the principles of both natural and feudal law, excluded the children of different venters from inheriting from one another the lands of their common ancestor ; and one beneficial consequence, if not a cause of it, is the avoiding of some extreme hardships under the latter rule : ex gratia, if John Jones had had two sons by different venters, and no other relations whatever, and died, then the sou by the first venter had died, and then Harwood Jones, the bargainee had died, living the sou by the second venter ; by this rule, the son by the second venter would inherit $ whereas, if the reversion had vested in the son by the first venter, that then must have continued in him and his heirs, and could not be divested by any subsequent event making him or bis heirs not heirs to the first donor at the time of the reversion falling in, the son by the second venter could not, at Common Law, inherit, but the lands would escheat. In Cunningham v. Moody, Lord Hardwicke says, in a similar case, \u201c The Court never is sorry to see this happen between brothers and sisters of the half blood by the same father ; it both answers the intention and rule of nature.\u201d It is also in strict conformity to t!ie great principles of inheritance, it admits all the blood of the first purchaser, and none but the blood of the first purchaser.\nIt is a common case in Law, for lands to vest in one sub modo only, so as to be divested by a subsequent event, and vested in another. It occurs ex institutione legis in every instance where, on the death of a tenant in fee or in tail, bis lands descend to his daughter, brother,.uncle,. &c. and afterwards a son is born or other nearer heir .: the after-born issue shall enter upon the lister, brother, uncle, &c. and divest the estate which he or she took by descent. So it occurs often ex provi&ione hominis: as where lands are settled or devised to the use of the husband ami wife for life, remainder to such one or more of their children as they shall appoint; and in default of such appointment, to all their children as tenants in common : there on the birth of one child, Use remainder vests solely in it; hut on the birth of a second child, one moiety of the remainder is divested out of the first child, and vested in the second, and so on toiies qnoties ; and if the father and mother make an appointment, then the whole remainder is divested out of the children as tenants in common, and vested according to the appointment. Thife, if on the death of John Jones, an interest vested in his son Harwood, one moiety of that interest was liable to he divested, and was actually divested by the act of Assembly of 1795, and each of the. Defendants is entitled to a moiety of the lands, and of course to a moiefy of the profits.\nBut it is contended, that on the death of John Jones, no interest whatever descended to or vested in his sot\u00bb Harwood. Wherever the vesting of an estate, either in interest or in possession, depends on a contingency,* which, by possibility may never happen, it is calk'd a possibility; and the old authorities did not perhaps distinguish between them. But the law for a number of years past, has distinguished and made a wide difference between them. The first, where the vesting in interest depends on a contingency, which, by possibility may never happen, is called a bare or naked possibility, and has no existence until the event happens. It is a mere hope or expectation, such as an heir apparent has during the life of his father, and of course cannot be disposed of. The second, where the vesting in possession only, depends on a contingency, which, by possibility may never happen, is called a possibility, coupled with an interest; or there is a present existence in interest, although the taking effect in possession, depends on a future event: and .it has been decided by .degrees, that these last are de-scendible, releasable, assignable and devisable. It is admitted that John Jones, the donor, had a possibility coupled with an interest; it was descendible to his heirs, and he might have disposed of it from his heirs, either 'by release, assignment or d. vise. But on his death his son took no such interest. It was not descendible from him to his heirs. If he had died in the life-time of his ancle, his father\u2019s heirs and not his, would have been entitled at the death of his uncle, as has been shewn already. He could not devise it: nor could he assigp it; for devisable and assignable are convertible terms; a devise being only an assignment in contemplation of death. The son of John had not therefore, during the life of his uncle, a possibility coupled with an interest: but only a bare, naked possibility, a mere hope or expectation that he would be heir to his father at the death of liis uncle. The Legislature have disappointed this expectation by the act of 1795, declaring his sister should inherit equally with himself; so that these lands and the\u2019 profits thereof must be equally divided between them.\njSTo inconvenience even at the Common Law, conld have resulted from considering such possibility as in abeyance or suspension, on the death of the donor or first purchaser.' The uncle was tenant in fee-simple, constituted a complete feudal tenant, was dispunishable of waste, conld pray in aid of no remainderman, or rever-sioner, could even bring or defend a writ of right; and the power of alienation could only be restrained during the period which elapsed between the death of John Jones and his brother Harwood Jones.\nFearne\u2019s Essay on Remainders, &c. 5, 349,414.\n2 Bl.

The question submitted to the Supreme Court was, whether an action of covenant would lie on this deed to recover damages for :such deficiency ?", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "Taylor, Judge,\ndelivered the opinion of \"the Court:\nThis case does not essentially differ from that of Rickets v. Dickens & Wait, decided at this term : in both cases the actions are brought upon deeds of bargain and-sale. The one now declared on contains no covenant of warranty, and thus far corresponds with the deed set forth in the first count of the declaration in the other case : but the word \u201cgive\u201d is contained in the deed in the present case, which, according to the principles stated in the case of Rickets v. Dickens & Wait, would imply a warranty, if inserted in a deed of feoffment, &c.: but ia other forms of alienation gradually introduced gince the statute of quia empiores, no warranty whatsoever is implied, they bearing no sort of analogy to the original feudal donation. Lord Coke, in illustrating the statute de higamis, more particularly explains the several conveyances at Common Law, in which that word implies a warranty. \u201c The letter of this act, says he, in 2 Inst. 9.75, extends hut to the feoffor upon a feoffment madebut if \u201c dedi\u201d doth enure by way of release or confirmation, it importeth a warranty during the life of him who makes the deed: so it is, if a reversion expectant upon an estate for years, life, or in tail, be granted by this word \u201c dedi,\u201d and attornment had ; here \u201c dedi\u201d doth import a warranty, though the estate passeth not by way of feoffment.\u201d \u2014 Vide also 9 Blac. Com. 210. The deed in this case being a bargain and sal\u00e9, no implied warranty arises by force of any words, and though it would.be difficult to assign any satisfactory reason why the -distinction should be preserved at the present day, when deeds vary from each other only by a slight verbal difference, and when equal validity is conferred upon all by the ceremony of registration: yet the Court has no power to remove ancient land-marks : they-must administer the law as it is written, and leave the Legislature to alter what may be deemed inconvenient. There is a covenant in this deed for further assurance, which probably was designed by the parties to compel a future execution of- a conveyance containing the necessary warranty. If that be the case, the Plaintiff cannot be reme-diless, although, in the present suit, there must be judgment against him.\nHah., Judge,\ncontra. \u2014 Espiraasse, in his treatise upon the action of covenant, page 267, says \u201c there is no meed of the word covenant, nor of any particular form' of words to constitute a covenant in deed; for any thing under the hand and seal of the parties importing an agreement, shall support this action as amounting to a covenant- As- ip the case of a lease for lands, in * which are the \u2022words \u201c yielding and paying\u201d so much rent 5 this is a covenant, and this action lies for the non-payment, for it is an agreement for tiie payment of rent, which amounts to a covenant,\u201d and he cites 1 Roll. Abr. 518, 519. Sheppard, in his Touchstone, page 87, speaking of deeds, says, \u201c that the construction should be made upon the entire deed, and that one part of it doth help to expound another, and that every word (if it may be) may take effect and none be rejected, and that all the parts do agree together, and there be no discordance therein,\u201d Vide also Plow. 160. And many other authorities might be referred to which support the same principles. It must then be admitted, that every sentence in the deed which is now the subject of controversy, shall have some meaning attached to it, and the true question is, do the words and sentences of the deed import an agreement on the part of the bargainor that there are three hundred and forty acres in the tract of land which he conveyed by this deed ? Lands may be described in a deed of conveyance by course and distance directed by marked lines \"and corners, or by known and visible boundaries only, without mentioning course and distance. As to the first mode, a mathematician would tell you that there was sufficient certainty in it without making any actual survey. But when he should be told, that altuough a deed called for courses and distances, yet if the distances were longer or shorter, or courses different from those called for in the deed, he must be bound by them, he would probably think it safer to make an actual survey.\nIt is unnecessary to cite authorities to prove that course and distance must be controlled by real lines and corners. This rule has been long established by the. Legislature, and'enforced by judicial decisions. Where the lands are described by known and visible boundaries, without course or distance, there is generally a greater necessity for a survey. In the case now before us, three of the lines are said to run certain courses and distances to certain corners ; The fourth runs from a pine in Abbot\u2019s line with the said line to the first station. Those distances may be found to be shorter in fact, than those called for in the deed. The fourth line instead of being straight, may form a semicircle, because Abbot\u2019s line, with which it runs, may be of that form. Who must be supposed to be best acquainted with these lines and the quantity of acres contained within them, the purchaser or the seller ? I apprehend the seller .\u2022 and the parties to the deed for the land in question seem to have thought so too : for, in the deed by which he passes his title, and which evidences the contract of sale, he iiot only sells the land within the boundaries therein set forth, but sells it as \u201c containing'\u201d three hundred and forty-three acres. But it is said tiiat this latter member of the sentence is only descriptive of the land, and nothing more. To this I answer, if ittbe descriptive only, it must be as to quantity, and nothing else. If then the seller has by his deed described the land as \u201c containing\u201d so many acres, when in fact it does not; if he must be supposed to have been best acquainted with the quantity ; if \u201c every word should have effect in a deed (if it may be) and none be rejected,\u201d I think the conclusion must be, that the Defendant is liable for a deficiency.\nIt is asked, however, if upon a survey it should have been found that the tract of land contained more than three hundred and forty-three acres, what would have been the consequence ? Could the Defendant claim compensation beyond the stipulated price ? It is evident that he could not; and for the reasons before given, namely, that he has sold all the lands within certain boundaries, and let the quantity be what it may, he can claim no more than what he has agreed to take for all the lands within such boundaries. Nor could the Plaintiff set up a claim in the present case, had the Defendant omitted to stipulate, in addition, that there were within those boundaries three hundred and forty-three acres. If the words (i containing three hundred and forty-three, acres\u201d do not amount to such a stipulation, it appears to Hie that they can mean nothing: for all the lands contained within the boundaries set forth, would have passed without these words; and where persons sell lands and use these words merely as descriptive of the land, without intending to create a covenant as to quantity* they add the words \u201c more or less\u201d \u201c by estimation\u201d or some other words which shew their intention to be not to bind themselves as to quantity. To use the words of the President Pendleton, in the case of Joliffe and others v. Hite and others, 1 Call. 501, \u201c a man wishes to sell his land, and another willing to purchase, enquires what is the quantity ? The vendor answers, I hold it for so many acres, but-I mean to sell the tract as it is, more or less, and such is my price.\u201d He adds, this is perfectly understood by planters and farmers of the lowest order.\u201d I cannot but think that the principles to be extracted from this case in Call, support the construction which \u00cd contend for in the present- case. And although I fear that my opinion may be erroneous, since my brethren of the bench do not acquiesce in it, I feel bound to declare it to be my opinion, that, in this case, judgment should he entered for the Plaintiff.", "author": "Taylor, Judge, Hah., Judge,", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["Powell v.

Presley Hinton.\n\"J l From Warren. J\nA person- summoned as a garnishee may avail himself of any defence which he could make, were he sued by his creditor.\nA. summoned as a garnishee in a suit between B. and C, declared that he had given his bond to C. for \u00a38/0 ; that the debt really due at the time was only \u00a3801 15s; that the bond was given upon an usurious consideration, and therefore void. B. urged A. to make some, contract with C. for taking up this bond, assuring him that he might have confidence in C\u2019s integrity, and that if he would make such contract, C. would certainly p'ay to him B, the debt which he owed \u2022 to him; and A. believed from B\u2019s representations, that if. he made this contract, he would not be called upon by B. as a garnishee. A. agreed by a day certain to take up his bond and make payment to C, upon his deducting 12 1-2 per cent, from the amount thereof. After this contract was made, but before the day of payment agreed on, B. sued out an attachment against C, and A. was summoned as garnishee. Notwithstanding this summons, A. complied with his contract with C. and paid the money on the day. On this garnishment, no judgment of condemnation will be entered, and the garnishee shall be discharged.\nRichard Russell sued out an original attachment against Edward P. Davis, then residing in the State of Virginia, and Presly Hinton was summoned as a garnishee, to declare whether he owed said Davis, and if so, to what amount. Hinton appeared, and in his garnishment stated, that some time in the year 1804, he purchased from Davis a tract of land, paid down part of the purchase money, and gave six separate bonds to secure the balance; three of which bonds he had discharged, and as to the other three, he not finding it convenient to pay them as they became due, had entered into a contract with Davis to allow him more, than six per centum per year upon the money, provided .Davis would prolong the time of payment; and the three bonds amounting to \u00a3801 \u25a0 15s. 0d, currency of Virginia, had been surrendered to him, and he had given a new bond to Davis for the sum of \u00a3870, like money, and a longer time for payment had been given. He declared this last bond was given upon an usurious consideration. He further stated, that some time after this new bond was given, Davis came into this State, and that Davis, Russell and himself had frequent conversations upon the subject of the debt due by Davis to Russell, and also of the debt due by himself to Davis; that Russell urged him to make some other contract with Davis whereby the bond to Davis might be taken in, or as Russell expressed it, purchased in; alleging that he, Russell, had full confidence that in that event, Davis would discharge the debt due to him. That in consequence of Russell\u2019s persuasions and solicitations, he made a contract with Davis for the taking in of said bond, believing from Russell\u2019s representations that he would discharge him from any garnishment in relation to the said bond. That shortly after he had made his contract with Davis as aforesaid, Russell sued out this attachment and had him summoned as a garnishee: that notwithstanding this summons, he had fulfilled his contract with Davis, and had paid to him five huhdred pounds. Being asked what were the terms of the last contract between himself and Davis, he answered, that he proposed to Davis to take up the bond by a day certain, if Davis would discount twelve and an half per cent, thereon, and pay him part in cash, part in tobacco, and assign to him bonds on demand for the balance: that Davis acceded to this proposition, and the day of payment happening after he had been summoned as.a garnishee in this caSe, he had, notwithstanding the summons, complied with his agreement and made the payment. Upon this statement of facts, it was submitted to this Court to decide, Whether the Plaintiff was entitled to judgment of condemnation against the garnishee?", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "Locke, Judge,\ndelivered the opinion of the Court:\nThe garnishee has stated at full length, the nature of the debt, and the amount thereof, due to Davis at the time he was summoned at the instance of the present Plaintiff, and the last contract made with Davis, under which he has paid the five hundred pounds which the Plaintiff prays may be condemned for his use. He submits to this Court how far he is liable to the Plaintiff\u2019s demands. To determine the extent of this liability, it may be necessary to consider it on the ground of the debt due to Davis at the time lie was first summoned: and, secondly, on the ground of his second contract, by virtue of which the first debt was extinguished or surrendered to the Defendant. As to the first, it is a general principle, that a garnishee, when summoned by the Plaintiff in attachment, is entitled to make every defence against such Plaintiff, that he would be entitled to make against the original contracting party, had he brought suit. For it is rather a case between them, than between Plaintiff and garnishee; in as much as the Plaintiff\u2019s right to re cover must depend on some existing debt between gar-\u2019 nishee and his creditors. If, then, Davis had brought an action of debt upon the bond for \u00a3870, and Hinton had p]eaded the statute of usury, (as he has virtually done here,) and.the evidence shewed to the Jury that Davis had reserved to himself eight or ten pounds for the forbearance of every hundred pounds attempted to be secured by the bond, the Jury must have found that the bond was given on an usurious consideration, and therefore void: and if void as between Davis and Defendant, will be equally so between Defendant and Russell. On that part of the garnishment, therefore, no doubt can be entertained. -, ,\nBut it is alleged, that as Defendant, by virtue of a second contract, and after he was summoned as a garnishee in this case, has paid over to Davis five hundred pounds', ho is liable to the Plaintiff for that amount. This part of the case seems to indicate more than usual skill on the part of the- Plaintiff, to circumvent and ensnare an honest, unsuspecting man. At whose instance was this second contract made ? Did it not proceed from the intimations of the Plaintiff himself ? He recommended this measure to the Defendant, at the same time assuring him that he had full confidence in the integrity of Davis, and if this contract was made by Defendant, he felt certain that the debt which Davis owed him, would be paid. lie did not say, in express terms, that Defendant should be discharged from his garnishment: but his mentioning, that if Defendant made the contract, he had full confidence that Davis, in that event, would pay his debt; that owing to these solicitations of the Plaintiff\u2019, the contract was made, and in full confidence that Russell would look to Davis for his debt, and discharge Defendant, seem to be tantamount to an express discharge. For, if Defendant was or could be liable, there was no necessity to place any confidence in Davis, because the Plaintiff had the Law on his side to compel a payment from Defendant, let Davis act in any way lie pleased. But the case has impressed a belief upon the minds of a majority of the Court, that Plaintiff, knowing the bond to be usurious, and therefore his remedy gone against the garnishee, induced the Defendant to change the nature of his debt to Davis, under a belief which he artfully enforced, that if Defendant did so, he should not be called upon as a garnishee: and having induced Defendant to make a positive contract with Davis, a contract which, he well knew, Defendant would feel himself bound in honor to comply with, he would lay hold of that circumstance to compel a second payment by Defendant, by calling upon him as garnishee,.after he bad promised to Davis the payment of the money in such way, that Plaintiff well knew as an honorable man he could not decline the payment. If, then, the Plaintiff has made such de\u00bb clarations of bis feliance upon the integrity of Davis, as to induce Defendant to pay such sum as was really and honestly due to Davis, but of which Davis liad no legal mea^ns of compelling payment, be cannot afterwards have any claim on Defendant. If he should be made liable, he wrould be compelled to pay this debt twice, when, without the advice and influence of the Plaintiff, be was not liable to pay any part of it. The statute pf usury shielded him effectually. The Defendant cannot recover back the money which he paid to Davis, supposing it to have been paid upon an illegal consideration. Wc are therefore of opinion, that no judgment of condemnation ought to be rendered against the garnishee, and .that he ought to be discharged.\nHaix, Judge,\ncontra. \u2014 I think now as I did in the case of Gee v. Warwick, that a garnishee has a right to avail himself of any legal defence which he might have in his power, were, he sued in an action at Law by his creditor. If, in the present case, the debt due by the Defendant to Davis, was contracted upon an usurious consideration, it would furnish a good plea to the Defendant in an action o i - brought by Davis to recover it. ' The rights of the debtor a,,e no{. jmpairecl by the absconding of the' creditor : but to answer ,the purposes of justice, the rights of the creditor so absconding, are, bf our act of Assembly, transferred to others to whom he is a debtor. In such case, the garnishee is under the same moral as well as legal obligation to pay any debt to the Plaintiff, the creditor of his creditor, that he felt himself bound by to pay it to his creditor before he absconded. The Plaintiff\u2019s claim, in this case, is as strong upon the Defendant, as if Davis had assigned the bond in question to him. Although the garnishee may h\u00e1ve a good defence against a recovery upon the bond, founded upon the act of Assembly made to prevent usurious contracts, he ought not, after having voluntarily relinquished it as to Davis, to be permitted to shelter himself under it as to Russell. He was under no tie, legal or moral, to pay a cent to Davis j but, except as to this defence, he was under both to pay it to Russell. If lie was disposed not to retain another man\u2019s money unconscientiously, he should have well considered whose money it was. His conduct to Davis proves very clearly, that he did not intend to avail himself of that defence, but to pay what was really due. But he paid it to a person who was not entitled to receive it either on equitable or legal principles. The Plaintiff ought not thereby to be injured. In short, I think, that as the garnishee has relinquished the only defence he had at Law, (which is fully evidenced by his second contract with Davis) he stands, .as to the present Plaintiff, as if such defence never had been in his power \u00e9, and that having paid the money fo Davis, he paid it in his,own wrong, and of course should be compelled to pay it again, to the Plaintiff, whose moral right to receive it cannot be questioned, and whose legal claim to it the Defendant should not be permitted to dispute, after having renoun- eed the benefit of the only plea which, from his garnishment, he could with any success have relied upon. \u25a0\n3 Term Rep. 266.

The question arising upon the demurrer was, \u201c Whether, Mary Paris Moore, being an infant in ventre sa mere at the death of Julius Caesar Moore, she was entitled to a distributive share of bis estate.\u201d This question was sent to this Court, and was argued by Alfred Moore, one of the Defendants, in support of the demurrer, and by Gaston against it.\nAlfred Moore, in support of the demurrer.\nThe question for the determination of the Court upon the Defendant\u2019s demurrer, is this: Can an infant in ventre sa mere, take under our statutes of distributions, equally with a brother and sister of the deceased, who were living at the time of the brother\u2019s death, and capable of taking ? If it shall be the opinion of the Court, that such an infant can take, then the demurrer will be overruled \u2022, but if, ou the contrary, the surviving\u2019 brother and sister were entitled to take, exclusively, then the demurrer rnitst bo allowed, and the Defendant dismissed as to so much of the Plaintiff\u2019s bill as has been demurred to.\nIt will be observed, that the. claim made under the infant in the present case, is by representation ; for it was neither a brother nor sister: \u2014 it was a niece.\nThe Complainant can have no right except under the law of North-Carolina; and the sole question will be, whether this unborn infant could, under the law of North-Carolina, be capable of taking\u2019 its uncle\u2019s estate, by rc-presenting its father? The act of 1778 informs us, that the Common Law, the statute laws of England in force and use in this country, and our own acts of Assembly, passed previous to the declaration of independence, and not inconsistent with our form of government, constitute the law of this State. The acts passed since 1778 are also a part of our law.\nIt will be observed, that in no act of the British Par-liamcnt in force in this State, or in any act of our own Legislature, is there a single word to be found about an infant in ventre sa mere: we must therefore turn to the Common Law, and see whether a claim under such an infant can be supported.\nBy the Common Law, an infant in ventre sa mere was not considered as in rerum natura \u2014 Plowden 366. It was, indeed, regarded in some cases to avoid wrong and inconvenience, as other fictions are intended ; as where one had given warranty, and died without other heir, tins infant shall be vouched \u2014 Hobart 338 \u2014 Co. Lit. 390, a. \u00a7 744. But in Co. Lit. 100, b. it will be seen, if his sister be forejudged, he is bound, because he had no right. Sucli infant was only regarded to avoid wrong and inconvenience in cases of descent, for where he was to take by purchase, as in the present case, he was not regarded at all\u2014 1 Co. 95, a. \u2014 3 Co. 61, b. \u2014 1 Shep. Ab\u2019t. 143\u2014 Dyer 303-4 \u2014 2 Bl. Com. 169. This, therefore, is conclusive with respect to personal property which cannot descend \u2014 2 Tern. 710 \u2014 2 Brown, 47, 63. To kill such an infant, however maliciously, as by giving poisonous drugs to the mother for that express purpose, is not fe-J0ny \u2014 3 institutes, 50. And why is it not felony ? Why truly for the reason first given, that it is not considered as in rerum natura ; for if it was so considered, it is undoubtedly murder by the same law. Further, if a man had made his will, and devised or bequeathed property, real or personal, with a plain intent, that the interest should vest at the time of his own death, an unborn infant was utterly incapable of taking, although it had been his own child \u2014 3 Dyer, 303. There is no part of the English law more plain than this \u2014 there is not a dissenting voice among Judges or Lawyers respecting it, and this is grounded upon the reason first given, that such an infant is not in rerum natura ; for if the devise or bequest had been, that the infant should take when it should be born, then the devise or bequest is good, which may be fully seen in Fearne upon Devises.\nIt will be observed, therefore, that although it is not unlawful to make provision for such a child, when it shall come into life, a devise of .a present interest to such infant is absolutely void, because you cannot give to a nonentity. It should be further observed, that if a present interest given to such infant, is good at one period, it is good at another. In the early growth of a foetus, it is believed not to have life $ some mouths pass away, before it is supposed to be alive: in this nnanimated state, it would surely be absurd to suppose it could take any thing. Let us therefore suppose, that property is given to it at an after period to this first stage, say four months before its birth, and that the child is born dead, can it then be said that this gift vested any thing in the infant ? For if it did, let us look at the consequences. Should this infant, at this period of four months before its birth, have in existence a brother or sister capable of taking, but immediately before the birth, such brother or sister should die, and then the infant in ventre should be born dead ; will any man pretend that the property thus given to this unborn infant, vested in the brother or sister, so that their representatives arc capable of taking ? To shew the absurdity of this, let us further suppose that the child * 11 had died in its mother\u2019s womb several weeks before its birth : \u2014 who is to ascertain the precise moment when it did die, so that legal consequences should result from it? Suppose the child is never born at all, hut is taken from the mother piece by piece, as did actually happen to a woman in the neighbourhood of Wilmington, where the flesh dissolved of itself and passed away, and the bones worked through the belly of the mother, .bid it over enter into the head of any man, that administration could be granted upon the goods of such an infant ? Yet there is no written law forbidding it; the whole arises from the principle first laid down, that it is considered as not in rerum natura. For if it was considered as in existence, so as to be capable of taking property, there is neither law nor reason, why the same consequences respecting property should not follow in this case, as well as any other. What impropriety could'there be in a brother or sister taking under such circumstances ? It Is therefore apparent, that-the Plaintiff has no claim under the Common Law', and there is no statute law of England in force in tiiis country, or act of. our own Legislature, that can aid him in this part\u00edcula!\u2019.\nWe will next shew that a distributive share vests immediately upon tiie death of the intestate, as effectually as in the ease of a devise to take effect immediately upon the testator\u2019s death \u2014 1 Yern. 403 \u2014 3 Mod. 58.\nThe only support which the Plaintiff has for his claim, is the dvil law; for although the counsel who argued the case, did not venture openly to put it upon that footing, yet they took a course which, if successful, would produce the same effect. They contended, that oilr act of distributions was a copy of the British act, and ought therefore to receive a construction conformably to the British act; and that it really was the intention of the Legislature to have it thus expounded.\nIt must be obvious to every one, that there is no exPress*on *n olu\u2018 ac^\u2019 that either requires or can warrant such a construction. It will be remarked, that the English statute of distributions to which wTe refer, was passed in the 22d and 23d of Charles the 2d, and that by our act of 1778, no acts of the British Parliament which were not in force and use in this State at the time of our independence, are received as the law of North-Carolina. It has been pertinaciously adhered to by all our Judges, and the best informed Lawyers, that no act of the British Parliament, passed subsequent to the granting of our charter, which was in the 16th of Charles the 2d, was,in force in this State. Some acts of the British par-laiment, it is true, passed long after the granting of our charter, have been in use ; but this arose from the power of the British government over us, and not its right; and although these acts have been submitted to, they have always been complained of. It will be further observed, that these acts which have been submitted to from neebssity, and on account of the structure of the Courts, during the royal government, have always had a danse expressly enforcing them in the colonies ; which the British statutes of distributions certainly have not, and they have constantly been considered as neither in force nor use among us ; for if this was not the case, what occasion had our Legislature to pass a statute of distributions, which, as our adversaries contend, is in the very words of the British statute. From these circumstances, then, this must at least appear, that our adversaries contend for a construction of our act conformably to that upon a British act, which was never any part of our law.\nBut there has been introduced upon this occasion, adjudications of the English Judges upon their statutes of distributions; and as it is notorious, that the civil law lias always been rejected in England, 1 BI. Coni. 14, it may therefore be supposed, that when we find the Eng-lisli Judges deciding that an unborn infant is entitled to take, our Judges ought to decide in the same manner. Here we make this objection \u2014 Oiir Judges must decide all cases that come before them, according to the law of our own country. If, therefore, it should appear, that the adjudications of the English Judges are not sanctioned by the Common Law, the acts of Parliament in force in this State, and trio acts of our own Legislature, sack adjudications can by no means be regarded by our Judges; for if they should be governed by such adjudications op decrees of the English Judges, it can only be upon the. belief, that the opinions of English J udges are equal to acts of our Legislature. We can make it appear that the English Judges have decided rightly upon the authority of their oxen act; but when our adversaries assert, that our act is a copy of the British act, and should therefore receive the same construction, they are guilty of ,a great error. Our act of distributions does indeed copy the British act in every particular except the very one on which the British Judges were enabled to let in a posthumous child ; and on which all the hopes of the IPlaintiff are placed. For it will.be observed by the Court, that it is enacted in the third section of the act of 22 & 23 C. 2, that distribution shall be made of intestates* estates, according to his majesty\u2019s ecclesiastical laws.\u2014 Now in our act of distributions, the 2d clause which is directly above, and the 5th clause which is directly below (for the 4th clause is only to save the customs of York and London') arc copied, but the 3d section is carefully left out.\nAll writers upon the Law will inform us* that in construing statutes^ we are to look at the mischief intended f(J be remedied^ and then at the remedy provided against the mischief. Let us, then, see what was the evil existing at the time of the passing of this act of 22d and 23d C. 2d, and sec the remedy provided against it, and how far our statute of distributions conforms to the British statute.\nIt is known to the Court, that the Ecclesiastical Courts of England, have, from the time of their erection to the present day, had in the first instance the management of the personal estates of all intestate persons. These Courts are governed by two codes of, laws \u2014 the one for the government of all clerical matters, called the Canon ; and the other for the distribution of justice in all cases respecting property which were cognizable in them\u2014 which is the Civil Law. The great abuse which the ecclesiastics made of their power, by taking the whole of the dead man\u2019s estate to themselves in pios usus; or by dividing it between the widow and children, in an arbitrary, and frequently capricious and unjust manner, in violation even of their own rules of distribution, was for centuries, a source of complaint in England. The remedy for the evils complained of, progressed slowly\u2014 By Statute Westminster the 2, 13, Edw. 1, c. 19, the ordinary was compelled to pay the debts of the deceased as far as the goods would go. Statute 81, Edw. 3, c. 11, took the management of intestates\u2019 estates out of the hands of the ordinary, and compelled him to grant administration to the next of kin to the deceased. It will here be proper to observe, that until this time, there was no/such thing as an administration in England \u2014 to the Common Law such a term was utterly unknown ; for by that law, upon the death of a man, any body might take possession of his personal estate, and whoever did so, had the sole management of it; and such person was styled executor. \u2014 1 Neis. Abt. 143, 5th Repts. 82. It will easily be perceived therefore, how the Priests who were better served than .any other people, and had their emissaries all over the kingdom, came to be the sole managers of intestates\u2019 estates. Statute 21, H. 8, allowed the ordinary to grant administration to the widow, next of kin, or both at option.\nWow, after the passing of these three statutes, all the relief gained, was that of compelling the ordinary to pay the debts of the deceased j for the residuum, after taking out the partes rationabiles, remained in their hands, or in those of the administrator they had appointed, from whom they always took bond, to distribute according to their directions. This residuum might as well consist of the whole as a part of the estate; for by the Common Law, which before the passing of the Statute of 22 & 23 C. 2, guided the course of distributions, if a man died intestate, one-third of his estate went to his widow, one-third to his children, and the remaining third to the King; if he died without a wife, then one-half went to his children, and the other to the King \u2022, if without \u25a0wife or child, then the whole went to the King, for a brother or other collateral could in no event take. \u2014 2 Bl. Com. 491,. 492, 494. But at a very early period this branch of the royal prerogative, was granted by the King, to the prelates in pios usus for tiie benefit of the dead man\u2019s soul. To remedy the hardships resulting from the course of distribution at Common Law, and the still greater hardships resulting from the grasping avidity of the clergy, the statute of 22 and 2 3 Charles 2, was passed; which after dividing the dead man\u2019s estate between the widow and children, and letting in the brothers and sisters, and their representatives or next of kin, in default of children, enacts in the 3d section, \u201c to divide and settle, and to compel such administrator to observe and pay the same, by the course of his majesty\u2019s ecclesiastical laws.\u201d Here it appears that provision is made in this 3d section, for the case of an unborn infant; because by the eccle siastical law, an unborn infant is considered in existence, and is equally entitled to take, with a child actually born ; which is directly contrary to the Common Law, as f,as (,een she\\vn. Had it not been for this section, sucli unborn infant would have been left in England as it is here, to the operation of the Common Law. It will clearly .appear therefore, that when it is as-sprted, that our statute is a copy of the British statute, the assertion is incorrect, because the only part of the British statute, which cad authorise a Judge to \"decide upon the Civil Law, in favour of an infant in ventre, has been left out in our act, and under remarkable circumstances, for we have copied from the British statute, directly above and directly below. The insertion of what is contained in the 3d section of the British act, into that act, is a plain proof that it was perceived by the British parliament, as it is perceived by us, that without that section, an unborn infant could not take; because if it could, there was no reason for introducing- the Ecclesiastical Law, which could only operate upon that single point, for in every other particular, the statute was in itself full, clear, and complete. However proper therefore it might appear to construe our statute of distributions, as the English Judges construe theirs, in those parts where they precisely agree, what reason can there be for saying, that we are to construe our statute upon a section of the British statute, which has been excluded from ours, and upon which alone the Plaintiff\u2019s claimde-pends ? This exclusion has the very same effect with a direct negative ; it is equivalent to a dictate of our Legislature to us, that all the other parts of the British statute should be regarded, but this should not; for they have taken in the one and left out the other. If this conduct has been unwise, it is for the Legislature alone to alter it \u2018, but the Defendant will venture to offer a conjecture, that whenever they come to legislate upon it, they will not adopt what is. now contended for, under the 3d section of the act of Charles 2d. It would be very easy to show, if it was necessary to trouble the Court .with an ana.ogy to other acts of Assembly, that the Legislature has always hadf a leaning to that branch of the family from whom the propei ty was acquired, which is our case, for the Defendant retains nothing but his father\u2019s property, in opposition to a man who is a stranger in blood, and claims under a woman who was also a stranger in blood to his father.\nAmong the cases which have been introduced by the Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, there is bat one, the case of Wallis and Hodson, 2 Mk. 115, which can be said to bear upon the present question, and this merely because it was a question respecting a collateral. The Defendant, therefore, passing the other cases by, will proceed to examine this, as it is the one most relied upon j and from this ho will plainly make it appear the Plaintiff receives no support.\nThe principal reasons which governed Lord Hard-wicke in the case of Wallis and Hodson, as he himself declares, were, that the Plaintiff was in rervm natura, and that by the rules of the Common and Civil Law she was as much a child, as if born in the father\u2019s life time: and to shew that she would so have been considered at Common Law, he cites the case of an infant in ventre being vouched in a common recovery. But it will here be observed, that this argument is forced, because such infant cannot be vouched alone, the heir at law in being must be joined with him \u2014 Co. Lit. 39.0, a. \u00a7 744. It is a mere fiction to avoid wrong and inconvenience \u2014 Hobart, 338, and is restricted entirely to cases of descent \u2014 1 Co, 95, a. \u2014 1 Shep. M\u2019t. 143. He further says,,that a devise to such infant is good by the opinions of Treby and Powell. It was said in argument by Powell, that \u201c a devise to an infant in ventre sa mere, by the better opinions, though various, is not good \u2014 vide 11II. 6 \u2014 13 Bvo. Devi. 32 \u2014 1' Mol. 609-10 \u2014 Dyer, 303-4, 342 \u2014 Mod. 127, 177, 634 \u2014 2 Buis. 2.72, \u2014 1 Bol. Repts. 110 \u2014 Lit. 255 bathe says he is of a different opinion in the case before him, because \u201c it is plain testator intended, a future devise.\u201d lordship says further, that an injunction may be granted in its favour to stay waste, and cites 2 Vernon 710, Musgrave and Parry \u2014 yet there is no such injunction in that case, and the Chancellor there decided against the infant in ventre.\nIt is entirely manifest, therefore, that neither the Common Law, nor any statute in force in this country, had the least share in bearing Lord Harckwicke out in his decree. But the sanction for the decree of Lofd Hard-wiclce is found in the sd section of the act of Charles 2d, and there also is the sanction for the dictums or decrees of the Lord Keeper.North, and Lord Raymond; and the Defendant here defies the most laborious and best informed Lawyer, to produce a single case adjudged in a Common Law Court, prior to the passing of the act of 22d and 23d Charles 2d, where an infant in venire was held capable of taking a present interest. If the decree of Lord Hardwicke is not to be justified upon this section of the act of Charles 2d, then it is without any justification at all, and so would incontestibly appear, from the examination that has been given it. After the most attentive examination, then, of the case of Wallis and Hodson, this is the result. If Lord Hardwicke decided properly, it was in consequence of the 3d section of the act of Charles 2d, enforcing the ecclesiastical law; which is of no more force in this country than the Persian or Hindoo law \u2014 if his decree was not grounded upon this, then it was an illegal decree ; and certainly, therefore, in either case can have no force as a precedent.\nWhether sound policy would justify the Court in deciding against the Defendant, supposing they had a right to exercise their opinions respecting policy, is worth some attention. \u2019 Upon the death of the father, the mother, it is said, is to take the whole, in case of the death of the child. Now, by the Common Law, the next heir to an infant could never be its guardian $ and why ?\u2014 \" because he is interested to destroy his ward.\u201d Is not a mother interested to do the like ? Suppose the case of a deformed and sickly wretch of a child, a large estate, the mother young and under strong temptations in the prospects of a second marriage \u2014 how easily may a sucking child be destroyed without detection; who is there to guard this infant by day and night, no brother or sister to share the property ? But the case is yet worse; suppose her married, and the husband more anxious to get the estate, than to preserve the life of the child \u2014 what then ?\u2022\u2014\nIt is confidently believed, that should the question of Law be in favour of the Defendant, it could not be otherwise than gratifying to the Judges to decide in his favor, from the peculiar complexion of the case. But other cases may arise, depending upon the same, principle of Law, under such circumstances of hardship, as could not fail to move the compassion of the Judges. But this neither can nor ought to have any weight upon their minds; hut if such feelings can become overruling ingredients in any case, the Defendant is surely entitled to the full benefit of them. From the earliest times, as far as we have any knowledge of the Common Law, until 10 and 11 Wm. 3d, such hardships did exist in England in all their rigour, with respect to an infant in ventre taking a contingent remainder, and doubtless must have often and severely exercised the feelings of the English Judges ; still the Law, hard as it might appear to be, was never attempted to be controlled by their feelings $ the Parliament alone was resorted to for relief.\nIn a question of such importance as the present, nothing that can by possibility operate upon the minds of the Judges, ought to be left un,examined. It may be said, that the question has been already settled by adjudged cases in our own Courts, which ought to govern the present case. It is not known to the Defendant, that any case like this has ever been adjudged : but if there had been hundreds of them, it is contended they have no authoritative power to bind the judges in this case. There is a plain difficulty arising from want of information respecting what has hem adjudged \u2022, for as far as has been seen of the books of reports, it is well known to the Defendant that many of the cases reported, have been entirely misconceived, being cases in which the Defendant was himself concerned when he was at the bar, or determined when he was upon the bench. If any adjudged case in this country, ought to have any validity as a precedent, it must be because it has been rightly adjudged; for if the contrary should prevail, it is not conceivable what sort of security there can be for property in this State; for there are abundant cases to be found, that are directly contrary upon the same question. What, then, would be our situation ; a Judge is at liberty to choose which side he pleases, and consequently to decide for or against a man, and has equal authority for it; in fact, there has never been a Court in this State, so constituted as that it might be said to be safe to take its adjudications for authority. Before the revolution, the Superior Courts were all Circuit Courts, and no man acquainted with the profession, will say, that any law question of importance can be satisfactorily and safely settled upon a circuit \u2022, the reasons are too obvious to be insisted upon. Errors notorious have liben committed by the wisest Judges under such circumstances, and such have frequently been corrected ; but not in this State, because the cases were taken up and settled at the same Court, amidst a multitude of other business, and no writ of error or appeal, for a revisal of such question, was practicable. There were, indeed, a few instances upon demurrers, cases agreed, and the like; but these were also settled in khe midst of the same hurried scene. The same objection applies to the Courts established since the revolution, where three judges made the circuit. After a fourth Judge was added and the circuit divided, the inconsistencies increased, until the establishment of the Court of Conference, (trow :tlic Supreme Court, which, as could easily be shewn, is very different from a Court v . of errors and appeals,) before which our judiciary has never presented such an aspect as to make adjudications of any authority. Whether this last Court has or has not decided this question, is not known to the Defendant j but if it lias, it can only be in a few ca&es, and certainly without that view of the Case which it is here attempted to present. Besides, the Supreme Court is itself in too fluctuating a state to give such an important effect to its decisions; for it will be i*ecollected, that if the argument here offered is insufficient to entitle the Defendant to prevail, the Judges now to decide have no need to rest upon adjudged cases; they must decide against him because the Law is againt him. But if, upon the other hand, the argument is sufficient to shew his legal right to the property demanded of him, then what would follow ? \u2014 he must still lose that legal right, because there are adjudged cases that are evidently erroneous.\nTo conclude \u2014 if there is such a thing as natural justice, it is on the side of the Defendant in the present case, for he retains nothing but his father\u2019s property, against a man who is an utter stranger in blood. What the law of North-Carolina is, has been clearly shewn\u2014 It has been plainly declared in the act of 1778 ; by that law, the Plaintiff in the present caso can have no claim. It has been shewn that the Civil Law is not a part of our law, and that the Plaintiff\u2019s right is derived under that law. It has been shewn that the adjudications in England, so far as they are in support of the Plaintiff, are all bottomed upon the Civil Law: \u2014 that *the Judges in England have decided right, because they have been directed to decide as they have done by a clause in their act of distributions. Should the Judges in the present case decide as the English Judges have done, it must be wrong, because the section of the British act which made it lawful and proper in the English Judges to decide as they did, has been totally omitted in our statute \u2014 it is not in the competence of our Judges to 1 . supply the place of this section, because that would be to make law instead of expounding it. Until the Defendant, therefore, shall be better instructed by the fallacy of some important part of his argument being shewn, he must feel entire confidence that the Court will dismiss him as to so much of the Plaintiff\u2019s bill as has been demurred to.\nGaston, contra.\nThe demurrer presents the question, whether a posthumous child can take a distributive share. The difficulty of this question is not commensurate with its importance, whtether we regard, 1st, The words of the statute of distributions; 2dly, The design of the Legislature $ or 3dly, The doctrine of the law on analogous subjects.\n1st. The statute of distributions passed in the year 1715, ch. 48, provides, \u201c that the surplus (after provision for the widow,) shall be distributed by equal portions to and amongst the children of the intestate, and if there be no children, then t\u00f3 be distributed equally to every of the next of kin, who are in equal degree, and to those who legally represent them.\u201d On account of a verbal inaccuracy in the 6th section of this act, its provisions were re-enacted by the act of 1766, ch. S. Some alterations as to the widow\u2019s share, were made in 1784 and 1787; but so far as respects the present controversy, the law of 1715, as explained by that of 1766, remains yet the same. Does Mary Paris Moore legally represent her father James ? This enquiry depends upon the proper construction of the word \u201c children,\u201d used in the first part of the clause cited : this word, both in its legal and ordinary acceptation, embraces as well those born after, as before the intestate\u2019s death , and thus it must be understood, unless there be conclusive reasons for restricting its signification. In the first place, it is said, that an infant in ventre sa mere, is not actually in rerum natura ; that it is a mere non-entity, and of course cannot then take. Upon this point, the counsel in support of the demurrer, has shewn much curious learning and speculation, which it is not necessary to examine minutely; because it is not contended that an.infant takes when in ventre sa mere, but that it shall take when it comes into being, and shall be regarded by the administrator in making distribution. To this, however, it is said, in the second place, that the right to distribution must accrue immediately upon the'intestates\u2019 death, and 1 Vern. 403 \u2014 3 Mod. 38, are cited to prove this position : hut these cases do not establish this position ; they prove merely the transmissible nature of a right of distribution. It does not follo\\v from this circumstance, that a posthumous child cannot take a distributive share, any more than it fallows from the transmissible nature of a legacy, that it cannot be given to a child in ventre sa mere. Decisions will be quoted in a subsequent part of the argument, to prove the corx*ectness of this distinction?\n2d. What was the design of the Legislature in passing the act of distributions ? To discover this design, let us observe the rules laid down in Heydon\u2019s case \u2014 3 Rep. 7. What was the mischief? That the administrator had all the estate; for the bonds taken by the ordinary in England to compel distribution, were illegal \u2014 1 Lev. 233\u2014 2 P. Wins. 441-447. What the remedy ? An equal distribution among those equalhj dear; an universal will, according to the principles of equity, and the feelings of nature. How much will this remedy be fettered \u2014 the principles of equity, and the feelings of nature outraged, by the Defendant\u2019s construction. ? If the makers of the statute were asked, whether they meant to add to the miseries of the posthumous orphan, by forbidding him any part of his parents\u2019 personal estate, what would be their answer ? The intention must be manifest, and ought to be regarded, even though it were not well expressed by the words: how much more when perfectly consistent with them.\ngd. If we look into analagous decisons, we shall find that in all instances, both at Common Law and by Statute, (unless when it is repugnant to some inflexible and rigid principle) children in ventre sa mere, are considered, when they come into being, as having the same rights with those who had an actual existence. They may take by descent \u2014 Co. Litt. 55, 3d Wills. 516. They may take by devise \u2014 Fowell on Devises, 320 to 326. They may be executors or take a legacy \u2014 Godolphin 102. They will take benefit of a term to raise portions \u201cfor the children of Jl. living at his death.\u201d Hale v. Hale\u2014 Free, in Ch. 50: Beale v. Beale-r-1 P. Wins. 246. They will take under a bond in favour of \u201c such children us Jl. shall have living at his death.\u201d Gibson v. Gibson, 2 Freeman 233. They may have an injunction to stay waste \u2014 Free, in Ch. 50. They come, within the exceptions for the benefit of infants in the statute of limitations \u2014 1 Flow. 366. They are, as to all beneficial purposes, considered as in rerum natura \u2014 5 Term Rep. 49. 2 H. Black. 399. What possible reason can then be assigned why they should not be regarded in like manner under the act of distributions ? They are so regarded in England, from which our statute is really borrowed \u2014 2 Freem. 230 \u2014 Ball v. Smith. This case was decided by Lord Somers, only twenty-eight years after the statute of distributions of that country was passed \u2014 2 P. Wiiis. 446. Edwards v. Freeman : this case was decided by Lord Chief-Justice Raymond, in 1727 \u2014 2 Mk. 115. Wallis v. Hudson, decided by Lord Chancellor Hard-wicke, in 1740 \u2014 1 Ves. 156.\nBut it is said that these decisions are founded upon the Civil Law, by which the statute of 22d and 23d Charles 2d, directs the division to be made. .The statute contains nothing more as to directing distribution by the rules of Civil Law, than ours. It is true that the latter part of the 3d section 'is not found in our act, for we had no Ecclesiastical Courts. The Civil Law was probably intended to be regarded, because by that law, testamentary matters and the estates of intestates had generally been regulated; and because the main design of the act was to authorise the ordinary to take such bonds as were before taken without authority \u2014 2 P. Wins. 447. Precisely the same reason applies to the construction of our act. The acts of 1723, ch. 10, and of 1762, ch. 5, sec. 23, dii\u2019ect the mode of proceeding in conformity to that used in th\u00e9 Eccesiastical Courts in England \u2022, and the c^e of Dickenson and Spier decided in this Court, shew that this mode is to be pursued in all matters of a testamentary. nature.\nWe are not to understand from this that no part of the civil law is in force in England; for although the body of the civil law has been always rejected, nevertheless parts of it have been adopted, vide 1 Bl.

The reasons given in l Burrows 474, 483, for the construction of the bankrupt laws in England, apply in their fullest force to the bankrupt law of the United States ; and were the act of Congress to receive the construction contended for on the part of the defendant, it could not produce that perfect equality which it intends between the bo-na fule creditors of the bankrupt, or of restraining one creditor from acquiring a preference over another equally meritorious. At the time the several judgments mentioned in the case were obtained in the County Court of Halifax, it is certain that the trader was in a state of insolvency, and unable to pay all his creditors to the full amount of their respective demands. Justice and the true spirit of the bankrupt law required that whatever funds the unfortunate trader had, should be equally apportioned among those per sons who liad placed their property in his bauds to trade upon for their common benefit; and yet while the trader was imprisoned, and the bankruptcy progressing to maturity, one creditor by means of an execution possesses himself of the whole of the, trader\u2019s effects, before the expiration of the two months \u2014 this is an advantage never intended by the bankrupt law, to any individual creditor. To avoid this advantage the act. must receive the construction contended for by the assignees, namely that the bankruptcy (the two months having expired) must relate to the first arrest \u2014 if so, Baker was a bankrupt on the 24th day of August, 1803\u00bb his estate vested in the assignees from that moment, and they arc entitled to judgment on this ground.\nSecondly \u2014 On the 6th day of April, 1803, Baker being then indebted more than he was worth, conveyed all his real estate to Norfleet, one of his creditors, the suits of the Bells, Flemming & Co. and of the present defendant, then pending against him. The conveyance was a dear and unequivocal act of bankruptcy : it was giving One creditor a preference at the expense of all his other creditors, l Bur. AG7. 2 Bur. 829. 4 Bur. 2174. 3 Wills 47. Cowper 629. 1 Brown Ch. Caaes 99. Doug. 91. These cases also shew that every conveyance by deed in contemplation of bankruptcy, is an act o f bankruptcy ; nor does it matter how meritorious the creditor may be \u2014 But it is said that this act of bankruptcy cannot avail the assignees in this action, because it was not the act of bankruptcy in which the commission issued. To this it is answered that it is wholly immaterial on what particular act the petition andcommis. sion may be founded. There may have been many acts of bankruptcy committed by the trader before any application made by the petitioning creditor for a commission. But when the commission does issue, the assignees have a right to recover in any property which belonged to the trader at any period when he was insolvent, and in contemplation of bankruptcy committed an act which in law amounts to bankruptcy \u2014 All the creditors of a trader ought to be con- sidercd as his partners, and if a loss must be sustained, all the creditors should bear a proportional share of it.

The Defendant removed from Pennsylvania, and settled in this State. On the 15th May, 1794, the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiffs, acknowledging the debt, and praying further time for payment. On 26th December, 1805, he wrote to the same effect, and on the 4th November, .1806, he wrote to the agent of the Plaintiffs, expressing a hope that they would take the amount of the penalty of the bond, divided into three annual payments.

This decision, however, was afterwards overruled by Lord Kenyon, 6 Term Eep. S03. And in the case of M\u2019Clure v. Knight, 1 East. Rep. 426, the Law seems to have been considered by the counsel and the Court as settled : for the only question, made in the argument was, whether on a judgment rendered in Ireland on a penal bond, the Plaintiff in a suit brought in England on such judgment, was entitled to recover beyond the penalty ? which was properly decided in the affirmative, on the ground that the nature of the demand was altered by the judgment, and that it was competent for the Jury to allow interest on what was there ascertained to be due. The other cases cited by the Plaintiff are Btinbunj 23, and 2 Dallas 252.\nThe first is a Chancery decision, and is reported by the Reporter in a line and a half \u2022, in which he states \u201cthat interest was decreed to be paid on a bond, although it exceeded the penalty.\u201d But none of the Cases to which he refers support the principle of the decree, and some of them are entirely opposed to it. The first from Hardress 136, was a bill to be relieved against an extent on a judgment in debt for a penalty of \u00a31500, after satisfaction of the penalty by perception of the profits according to actual receipts, but not according to the extended value. The Court would not give the Complainant relief without paying costs and damages for it appeared there had been a default in him in not permitting the Defendant quietly to receive the profits upon a former extent, whereby he was put to great charges, and the Court declared the Plaintiff should either have all Law or all Equity. 1 Ch. Ca. 271, was the case of a jointress who had paid a mortgage, and she was permitted to hold over until repaid with interest. The other cases, 2 Ch. Ca. 226, and 2 Ver. 509, are in direct opposition to the principle which they were cited by Banbury to support; To which may be added the cases reported in 1 Atk. 75. 3 Bro. 489, 496. 1 Ver. 349, referred to by Defendants. Counsel. The other case cited by the Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel from 2 Balias 252, wpuld at first view seem to conflict with the English decision $ but it is believed a distinction may be drawn between that case and those decisions. That was a suit on a penal bond conditioned for the performance of a.collateral act, on a stated day, to wit,, the procuring of a patent within six months for a tract of land which the Defendant had sold to the Plaintiff. The Judges, in delivering their opinion, considered the penalty as a debt duo to the, Plaintiff, on the day when the collateral act was to have been performed, and that upon that ground he was entitled to retain a verdict for interest beyond the penalty which the jury gave for the detention of the debt \u2014 From a review, therefore, of the cases on the subject, it may be considered as a settled point, that except in some particular cases, where a collateral act is to discharge a penalty which is inserted in a bond as a debt which is to become due on the failure of performing that act on the day stipulated $ or in cases in Equity framed upon some specific ground of relief, the penalty of the bond is all that can be recovered, either at Law or in Equity. As to the question made by the Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel, whether there is any difference between common conditions to penal bonds and the one sued on, which binds the obligor to the amount of the condition with interest till paid ; this is nothing more than a condition in Law, which would arise without its being stated in the bond, and was inserted either from an ignorance of the Law, or from an excess of caution : But it cannot be considered as intended to increase the obliga 'tion of the Defendant. It is therefore the opinion of the Court, that the Plaintiff should enter a Remittitur for the amount assessed for interest by way of damages.", "author": "Weight, Judge,", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["Warden & sons v.

The case was sent to this this Court, upon the question, Whether the gift vested such an interest in Elizabeth, the daughter, as enables lier husband and herself to recover the negro.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "By the Court.\nWe are of opinion, that the daughter, Elizabeth, having survived her father, the donor, the property in the negro girl vested absolutely in her at his death, and that the Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment.\nThe decision in this case has been thought to militate against the rule of tile Common Law which forbids the creation of future interests in a chattel after a life estate therein, except by executory devise, or by way of trust. It is to be regretted, that the Court did not assign at length, the reasons upon which tlieir decision was founded; but it will be seen, from a consideration of the principles upon which it is probable their decision was made, that it does in no wise impugn the rule of the Common Law. The case of Tims v. Potter, 1 Hayw. 234, 275, is the leading case in our Courts upon this subject. Glover gave a negro girl to Ms daughter, reserving to himself a life estate in the said negro. The daughter survived the father, and after his death brought an action of detinue to recover the negro and her increase. The principal question upon the trial, was, Whether the Plaintiff was entitled to the children of the negro gir\u2019, born during the life of Glover, the donor ? The validity of the gift to the daughter was not questioned. Various other cases have occurred since that time, similar to the one of Tims and Potter, and the Courts have considered the gift as vesting an estate, in the donee ; and the Courts have probably proceeded upon one or the other of the following grounds : 1st. That where one person gives a chattel to another, reserving therein a life estate, the Law deems the gift a present one, in case the donee survive the donor, and to take effect in possession in that event; but that the interest of the donee during the life of the donor, is a mere possibility, which is not transmissible to the representatives of the donee ; and that if the donor survive the donee, the interest in the chattel remains entire with him, and goes to his representatives. And this possibility differs from a contingency; the first having no actual existence till a certain event happens; the second having an actual existence, which may or may not take effect. Upon this principle, if Parish Self had survived his daughter, the negro girl would have belonged to him in absolute property, as before the gift, and would have gone to his administrators after his death, his daughter having nothing during his life but a mere possibility: but in the event of her surviving her father, the gift took effect in possession. The interest and estate in the negro were not out of the father by the gift: he parted only with a possibility of interest, which was to take effect or not, as the event should happen of the daughter surviving him or not.\nThe case of Roberts, adm\u2019r, &c. v. Polgrean, 1 Hen. Black. 536, illustrates the above principle, and shews that the cases of Tims and Potter, and Duncan and wife v. Self\u2019s administrators^ do not militate against the rule of the Common Law, which forbids the creation of future interests in a chattel after a life estate therein, except by execu-tory devise or by deed of trust. In that case, the limitation of a term was, \u201c to Mary Rawles, during her natural life, with remainder to her son William Rawles, and his issue lawfully beg-otten : and in default of issue of said William Rawles, then to Elizabeth Polgrean, (the Defendant,) daughter of the said Mary Rawles, during her natural life\u201e with remainder over.\u201d Mary Rawles conveyed the premises \u2022 during \u2022the remainder of the term, to her son William Rawles, his executors, administrators, &c. William Rawles then by deed of indenture conveyed the premises to \u201c Margary Coles and her heirs, immediately after the death of Mm the said William, to hold the same to her and her heirs forever.\u201d William Rawles survived Margary Cole, and died intestate and -without issue, and administration on his estate was granted to Elizabeth Polgrean (the Defendant.) Margary Cole died intestate, and administration on her estate was granted to her daughter, Mary Roberts. The suit was brought by Mary Roberts, as administratrix of the estate -of Margary Cole, to recover the possession of the leasehold premises, claiming under the deed made by William Rawles to Margary Cole: and two points were decided by the Court,\n1. That the deed from William Rawles to Margary Cole must be construed to be a present gift to the wife, in case she survived her husband, to take effect in possession on that event; and that William Rawles, the donor, having survived Margary Cole, the donee, the whole interest in the term survived, or rather remained in him.\n2. That this interest vested, upon William Rawles\u2019s death, in Ms representative. Elizabeth Polgrean was the person to whom the term was limited originally in default of -issue of William Rawles: yet the Court said slie could claim nothing under this limitation, but held the term in her character of administratrix of William Rawles\u2019s estate.\nThis case shews, that in all such cases as Tims v. Potter, and Duncan and wife v. Self\u2019s administrators, the donor remains possessed of his former absolute estate in the 'chattel; that his estate therein is not abridged by the gift, from an absolute interest to an interest for life ; that the donee takes by the gift neither a vested nor contingent re-\u25a0trninder, hut a mere possibility, which may take effect or not, as the clonee happen to survive or not survive the donor.\nThis case seems also to recognise the rule, that by deed, (not of trust) a chattel cannot be limited over after an estate for life, and that the estate for life absorbs the entire interest in the chattel. It would seem, that it was upon the operation of this rule, Elizabeth Polgrean, the Defendant, was adjudged to hold the term in her character of ad-ministratrix of William Rawles\u2019s estate, and not in her own right under the ulterior limitation contained in the first deed. Per, by the first deed, the term was limited \u201c to Mary Rawles during her natural life,\u201d and then over to William Rawles, and his issue lawfully begotten, and in default of issue of said William Rawles, to Elizabeth Polgrean during her natural life. As William Rawles died without issue, the term would have belonged to Elizabeth Polgrean under this limitation, had not Mary Rawles, the donee for life, taken the absolute interest; for the limitation over is not too remote, it being to take effect withm the compass of a life in being, it being \u201c to Elizabeth Polgrean during her natural life,\u201d and is the same as the Duke of Norfolk\u2019s case. The Court held, that Elizabeth Polgrean could claim nothing under this limitation. Mary Rawles, the donee for life, conveyed her interest in the term to her son William Rawles, and under this conveyance, he \u2022became possessed of the entire interest, and Elizabeth Polgrean having administered on his estate, she was adjudged to hold the term as his administratrix.\n2d. The Courts may have proceeded upon the ground that the reservation for life was inconsistent with the gift, and therefore void. This was the view taken by this Court of such a reservation, in the case of Vans and wife and others v. Hicks, decided at May Term, 1819.", "author": "By the Court.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["James Duncan and wife v. The adm\u2019rs of Parish Self, dec\u2019d."]}}}

If the Legislature is at liberty *() (prect the officers of State to issue grants for certain pro- \u00b0 \\ perty ; surely they arc at liberty to grant it themselves in a more solemn way by act of Assembly, which is an instrument subject to more scrutiny and solemnity in its passage than any other instrument known in our law. ft cannot be thought, that there is more danger of imposition upon the \u2019 \u201e , , . General Assembly, m the disposing o\u00ed public property ny act of Assembly, than there is upon individual officers convey-by srant-\nj\u201e fmth, the passing of public property by act of Assent- * * 1 * v * bly, hath been practised almost ever since the formation of our Constitution ; and has never been questioned. Some of n\u2018\u00b0st Earned Lawyers of former times, who had a prin-c'I,a* share in forming the Constitution, approved soon af-of the mode of passing the public property in this way.\nOn the 18th, of October, 1779, C.17, a tract of land was vested by act of Assembly in Thomas Person, his heirs and assigns$ on the same day another tract is declared to be and remain to Thomas Burk, his heirs and assigns: 17th April, 1780, a tract is vested in William Houston, his heirs and assigns ; another in Hannah Reed. Similar instances occur in 1780, C. 40, 1782, C. 36, 1783, C. 38, C. 42,1784, C. 71, 1786, C. 72, C. 82, 1787, C. 33, 1789, C. 56, and divers oilier acts passed since 1789. These several acts, demonstrate an unity of sentiment on this subject, not only of the profession, and of the Assembly, which has from time to time proceeded in this way ; but of the public, who have never questioned the validity of such conveyances. A more important question is, whether it is true, as argued on the other side, that a repeal of the vesting acts, divests the Trus- . ' * tecs of all the property acquired miner the former raws, which had not been disposed of when the repealing act passed.\nAnd if we consider either the nature of Conveyances, or of repealing acts of the Legislature ; and if we at the Same time admit the untrue position, that the Assembly had power, at pleasure, to rc-assume the properly which they had parted with by their grants ; still we shall be obliged to acknowledge, that they have not divested the Trustees of this property.\nIt is incontrovertibly true in regard to the Conveyances of individuals, that if the title be transferred by deed or other instrument; and that be afterwards lost, cancelled, or otherwise destroyed ; the title does not thereby revert to the grantor. Gilberts Law7 of Evidence, 107, states precisely \u201c that if a conveyance be made by lease and release, the uses were once executed by the stuttde, and they do not return back again by cancelling the deedand in this proposition he is supported by 1 Mo. 107. Boiler\u2019s N. P. 267. It is upon this principle that a contract cannot be dissolved nor property transferred, but by consent of the party, who is entitled to the benefit of it \u2014 it cannot be dissolved by the arbitrary act of one party, to the prejudice of the other, and without his consent; nor can it be re-transferred by any act, which is not assented to by the legal owner. Is the Legislature released, from the operation of this principle ? No: it is incorporated into the immutable law of natural justice ; and no power upon earth can rightfully overturn it. How comes it then, that a declaration of the nullity of the vesting acts, made several years after the property has completely passed from the Legislature, without consent of the Trustees, shall again restore it to the state ? Suppose such a declaration as completely to have destroyed those instru-. meets of conveyance, as ii'thev had been burned, or caueell-expunged from all the public .records ; still the title ^ias ah'eady passed, and some further art was requisite to re-vest these titles \u2014 ap art as we shall presently se.e far bey ond ^ie p0wers 0f t\u00a1ie Legislature to perform, if the most complete destruction of the. instruments of conveyance., will not restore the property, can such a consequence be derived from the nature of a repealing act ? This question is solved, by considering the effect of a repealing act. In common with other acts, it Inis pot any retrospective view; unless given it by express wordg. 1 do not deny but that the Legislature have power in pass retrospective laws, on subjects liable to their legislation: But such an exercise of power, is always the dictate of imperious iwccssilv ; is in itself odious; becauseit interferes with persons and things, who did not expect it, a\u2019-d is therefore not admitted; but when the words of the act unequivocally give it such a meaning. 4 Bur. 3461, 3 Mo. 310,2 Just. 292. The repealing act then in the case before us, having no reslrospec-tive terms, commenced its operation precisely at that point of time when it passed.\nWhat then became of all the property which had before that time vested in the Trustees? It was not in the least degree affected by the repealing acts. Our opponents say however, that the words of the repealing act resume, for the use of the state, all confiscated and esrheated lands not then sold although parted with before, and extends expressly to all former acquisitions; and that the repealing act is' really retrospective. For a moment be it so; then we are to enquire, not only what they have done, but also (which is far more material) what they had a right to do.\nAnd in order to make a fair experiment of the extent of legislative power,let us see how far the Legislature can interfere with the rights of private property; how far, with the property belonging to corporations; and then more par ticularly how far they have control over the property of the Unhersify of North-Carofina. The intangibility of pri\" vate property, is, to every com minify, a principle of the highest consideration: the industry of its inhabitants depends upon 51, and the necessaries and the comforts of life\u00bb which are results of industry, are produced by a belief in every citizen, that what his industry procures will be peculiarly Ftis-own. In despotic governments none labour, because the earnings of labour are not free from invasion ; and idleness and poverty, and the destitution of those things which render life, agreeable, predominate.\nNorth-Caroiina will find by fatal experience, the oftener her Legislature breaks in upon tiiis great principle, tho nearer will She approach to tiiis representation of despotism! Every example of innovation which slie gives, Will lessen the assurance of individuals in its sanctity ; because every hew instance gives new strength to the practicability of invasion, exposing to public view the futility of the maxim, which professes to render private property inviolable. Deliberate but one moment on the consequence of this principle, and its vast magnitude will rush.upon the senses. We shall be convinced of tho reasons, why all wise governments have made it a fundamental maxim of their political institutions j and why in ail free ones, it ought to be the most sacred. Those who argue for this power, can only derive it, either from tho inherent rights of sovereignty, or from some cl\u00e1use in the Constitution of North-Caroiina. If it he a right of sovereignty, it is because s\u00e1liis populi est su-. prema lex ; and can only be resorted to, where the maxim applies \u2014 in cases of extremity; and when an abstinence from the' use of private property, would endanger the public safety. Under such circumstances, it is better that one should suffer than all be ruined. Yet here, the individual who suffers to serve the public, must be compensated for his loss, because it is just that a loss sustained for the benefit of all should he borne equally by all. Thus compensation be-tcoraes a duty of the sovereign, without which he cannot rightfully practice the seizure or private property ; to say he will do it, without necessity and without compensa-w0uld be called tvranny in an individual sovereign : * J t and bow is it the less so where the same thing is done by a collective body ? Certainly there is no difference as to the individual Who suffers. Yattel, B. 1. C. 20, 244, decides that the right of eminent domain is in certain cases necessary for him who governs,, and consequently is a pert of the empire or sovereign power $' but when he disposes in a case of necessity of the possession of a community or individual, the alienation will be valid for the same reason but justice demands that this community, or this individual be recompensed out of the public money ; and if the Treasury is not able, yet all the citizens are obliged to contribute to it; for the expenses of the state ought to be, supported'equally or in just proportion : it is in this as in the case of throwing of merchandize overboard to save the vessel. The Assembly of Nerth-Carolina, circumscribed in its capacity by the fun-damenta) law of the'Constitution, cannot pretend to greater prerogatives than the Parliament of Great Britain, whose power is thus described by the most learned British authors, 1 BI. C. 160. \u201c The power and jurisdiction of Parliament, is so transcendant and absolute, that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons within any bounds!, it hath sovereign and incontrovertible authority, in making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviewing and expounding of laws; concerning matters of all possible denominations; ecclesiastical or temporal, civil, military, maritime or criminal; this being the place where that absolute despotic power which' must in all governments reside somewhere, is intrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms,\n\u201cIf can in short do every thing that is not naturally impossible, and therefore some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipotence of Parliament,\u201d 4dl*powerful however as it is, like the Gods, who are bound by the decrees of fate, it bows down before the sacred image of which I am speaking, and reverences holy rights of private property. 1 E!. C. 139, sh\u00e9^s the regard that is. paid to them, \u201c So great moreover\u201d says he, \u201c is the regard of the law for private property, that it will not authorise the least violation of it: no not even for the general good of the whole community.- If a neiv road for instance wore to be made through the ground of a private person, it might perhaps'be extremely beneficial for the pub. lie; but the law permits no man or set of men, to do this without consent of the owner of the \u00a1am . In vain may it be argued,\" that the good of the individual ought to yield to that of. the community ; for it wduSd be dangerous to allow any Private man,, or even any public tribunal,: to be the judge of this common good, and to decide whether it be expedient or no. \u2014 ^Besides, the public good is in nothing -more essentially interested, than in .the protection of- every individual\u2019s private rights,-as modelled by the municipal law. In this and similar cases,.\u00abthe Legislature alone have, and indeed frequently does interfere, and compel the individual to acquiesce. But bow does it interfere a yd compel? Not by absolutely stripping the subject of his property an an arbitrary manner, but by giving him a full indemnification,\u2019 and equivalent for the injury thereby sustained. -The public is now considered as an individual, treating with an individual for an exchange. All the Legislature does, is tb-oblige the owner to alienate his possessions .for a reasonable price ; and even this is an exertion of power, which the Legislature indulges with caution ; and which nothing but the Legislature-can perform!\u201d The despotic Legislature of Great-Britain cannot intermeddle with the rights of private property, hut in cases of urgent necessity, and not without making just compensation. And shall the Assembly of North-Carolina encroach upon those rights, when not required by public necessity, and without making any compensation at all ? I would fain know, in a concern of such .moment, whence it is, that they are less bound to respect the rights of private, property than the English Parliament ? and upon\u2019 v, hat oc casion it was, that the people cloatlied them with a discretion s^fatal to their dearest interests. To speak in com-of the British constitution, is unpleasant to an American ear, because of the idea which is connected with the absoluteness of its power. What then are we to say, when we hear it asserted, that the Assembly of North-Carolina surpass them in power, and can do what they cannot 2 It may be said, that the Assembly are the only judges of the existence of the necessity, which justifies the assumption of private property for public uses, if this be true, then the pre-requisite of public necessity is no restriction of their power; for in their judgment it may exist, when in the opinion of all others it does not; and thus a wrong committed against the rights of an individual, would be sanctified by the wrong judgment of the oppressor. Whatever respects the power of the legislature, must be judged of by those who are to determine of the conformity of its acts, to the powers delegated by the people; and when it is said that public necessity must precede their power to affect the rights of private property, and that they have done so without such necessity, whether it did exist or not, must be determined by some other persons than themselves. Before the act is done, either by the intervention of a Jury, as in the case of public roads; or by some other known mode, recognized by the laws and constitution of this country: and after it is done by the opinion of those Judges who are appointed to watch over the constitution, and are sworn to reject all unconstitutional acts. Then supposing this to be the case of an individual,' how does it appear that the public necessity demands that seizure of property, which the act in question contemplates 2 It is not to be found in the public records, nor in the public history of the country ; no verdict establishes it; nor is it even alleged in the preamble of the act: but above all, not a word of compensation is any where mentioned in it. It appears to be a seizure without necessity, without cause, and without compensation ; and is not justified by the right of eminent domain, belonging to sovereignly ; because it has not observed the restriction to which that right is subjected! *\nIs it then justified by any thing we find in the constitution of this State ? And it seems to me that there is no part of the constitution of our State, which allows to the Legis-iafure a right to divest the cit izen. or any corporation or set of citizens, of the rights of private property. There is a clause in our constitution, particularly applicable to this subject. \u2014 Bill of rights, section J\u00d3: \u201c no freeman ought to be taken, imprisoned, or disseised of Ills freehold, liberties op privileges, or outlawed or exiled, or iri any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the Jaw of the land/>\u2019 I will presently proceed to remark upon all the material parts of this section ; but before doing, so, let us notice the effects of a similar, but much less explicit provision, in the constitution of a sister State. It is contained in the 1st, 8th and 11th articles of the declaration of rights of. Pennsylvania, and in the 9th and 46th sections of the constitution of that State. The Legislature of Pennsylvania had passed an act to divest certain persons of titles acquired under the existing law and to place titles in others: and. this brought on the question, whether the law was agreeable to the constitution, and if not what was the consequence of its disagreement therewith. And after defining what is a constitution, the learned Judge who presided, discussed the question now under consideration. He defined a constitution thus: \u201c It is the form of government delineated by the mighty hand of the people in which certain fixed principles of fundamental law's are established. The constitution is certain and fixed : it contains the permanent will of the people, and is the supreme law of the land. It is paramount to the power of the Legislature, and can be revoked or altered only by the authority that mude it. What are Legislatures ? Creatures of the constitution : they owe thei existence to the constitution: they derive their power from the constitution. It is their commission, and therefore alj their acts must be conformable to it, or else they will v0\u00a1(]. The constitution is the work or will of the people themselves, in their original sovereign ami unlimited capacity. Law is the work or will of the Legislature in their deriva-f(ve or subordinate capacity : the one is the work of the Creator and the other of the creature. The constitution fixes limits to the exercise of the Legislative.authority, and prescribes the orbit within which it must move. Whatever may be the case ip other' countries, yet in \"this there can be no doubt tbat'ev'\u00e9ry act of the Legislature, repugnant to the constitution,'is'absolutely void. The late constitulion of Pennsylvania declares the rights of conscience, and that elections be by ballot. Could the Legislature annul these articles respecting religion, the rights of conscience and elections by by ballot? Surely no.' As to these points, there was no devolution of power. The authority was purposely withheld, and reserved by the people to themselves. If the legislature had passed an act declaring that in future there should be no trial by jury, would it have been obligatory ? No. It Would have been void for want of jurisdiction or constitutional extent of power. The right of trial by jury is a fun-damenta! l\u00e1\\y made s\u00e1cred by the constitution, and cannot he legislated away. The constitution of a state is settled and permanent, not to be acted upon by the temper of the times, nor to rise and fall with the tide of events. I hold it to be a clear position, that if a Legislative act oppugns a constitutional principle, the former must give way and be rejected on the score of repugnance, I hold it to be a po sition equally clear and sound, that in such a case, it will be the duty of the court to adhere to the constitution, and to declare the act null and void. The judiciary.in this country is not a subordinate but a co-ordinate branch of the government.\u201d He then comes to the point more immediately the subject of our present consideration. \u201c Those passages,\u201d says he, \u201c adverting to the before mentioned clauses of the constitution of Pennsylvania, \u201cdeclare that the right of acquiring and possessing property and having it protec* fed5 is one of the natural, inherent and unalienable rights of man. Men have a sense of property; property is necessary to their subsistence, and correspondent to their natural wants and desires; its security was one of those which induced them to unite in society. No man would he. come a member of a community in which he could not enjoy the fruits of his labor and industry. The preservation of property then is a primary object of the social compact, and by the .late constitution of Pennsylvania, was made a fundamental law. Every person ought to contribute his portion for public purposes and public exigencies; but*no one can be called upon to surrender or sacrifice his whole property, real and personal, for the good of the community, without receiving a recompense in value. This would be laying a burden upon one individual which ought to be sustained by the society at large. The English' history does not furnish one instance of this kind ; the Parliament, with all its boasted omnipotence, never committed such an outrage upon private property ; and if they had, it would have served only to display the dangerous. nature of unlimited authority. It would have been an exertion of power and not of right; such an act would be a monster in legislation, and would shock all mankind. The Legislature, therefore, had no authority to make an act, divesting one citizen ofhis free, hold and vesting it in another, without just compensation, It is inconsistent with the principles of reason, justice, and moral rectitude; it is incompatible with the comfort, peace and happiness of mankind ; it is contrary to the principles of social alliance in every free government; and lastly, it is contrary to the letter and spirit of the constitution. In short, it is what every one would think unreasonable and unjust in his own case.\n\u201c The next step in the line of progression is, whether the Legislature had authority to make an act divesting one citizen of his freehold and vesting it in another, even with compensation ? That the Legislature in certain emergencies had authority to exercise this high power, has been urged from the n\u00e1ture of the social compact, and from the words the Constitution ; which says, that the house of repreSentatives shall have all. other powers necessary for the Le-ure of a free state or commonwealth ,* but they shall ^ave 110 P?wer a<ld to, alter, abolish or infringe any part this constitution. The course of reasoning on the part of the defendant may be comprised in very few words. The despotic power as it is aptly called by some writers, of taking private property, when state necessity requires, exists in every government; the existence of such power is necessary; government could not subsist without it; aud if this be the case it cannot be\" lodged any where, with so much safety as with the Legislature. The presumption is tha they will not call it into exercise except in urgent cases, or cases of the first necessity. There is force in this reasoning. ft is, however, difficult to form a case, in which the necessity of a state can be of such a nature, as to. authorise or excuse the seizing of landed property belonging to one citizen and giving it to another citizen. It is immaterial to the state in which of its citizens the land is vested ; but it is of primary, importance, that when vested it should he secured, and the proprietor protected in the enjoyment of it. The constitution encircles and renders it an holy thing. The present case is a case of landed property vested by law in one set of citizens, and attempted to be divested for the purpose of vesting the same property in another set of citizens. It cannot he assimilated to the case of personal property t .ken and used in time of war, or famine, or other extreme necessity ; it cannot be assimilated to the temporary possession of land itself, in a pressing public emergency on the spur of the occasion. In the latter case, there is no change of property, no divestment of right; the title remains, and the proprietor, though out of possession for a while, is still proprietor and lord of the soil. The possession grew out of the occasion and ceases with it. Then the right of necessity is satisfied and at an end ; it does not effect the title, is temporary in its nature, and cannot exist forever. The constitution expressly declares that the rigid; of acquiring possession and of protecting property, is natura!, inherent and unalienable. It is a right, not ex gratia from the Le\u00bb gislature, but ex debito from the constitution. It is sacred, for it is further declared that the Legislature shall' have no . sower to alter, abolish or infringe any part of the constitu-;ion. The constitution is the origin and measure of the Legislative authority. It says to the Legislature, thus far shall you go, and no farther ; not a particle of it shall shaken, not a pebble shall be removed. Innovations are langerous ; one encroachment leads to another; precedent ;ives birth to precedent; what has been done may be done gain : thus radical principles are generally broken in upon, tnd the constitution destroyed. Where is the' security Where is the inviolability of property, if the Legislature, , positive act, affecting particular persons only, can take md from one citizen, who acquired illegally, and it vest in nother ? The rights of private property are regularly rotected and governed by general, known and established iws; and decided upon by general, known and established unals. \u2014 Laws and tribunals are not made and created on istant exigency, or an urgent emergency to serve a present irn, or the instant of a moment: tlieir operations and uence are equal and universal. They press equally 011 lence security and safety, tranquility and peace: one s not afraid of another, and no man afraid of the Legisla\u00bb ire.\n\u2018It is infinitely wiser and safer to risque some possible mis\u00bb hiefs, than to vest in the Legislature so unnecessary, dan\u00bb jrous and enormous a power as that which has been exer\u00bb sed on the present occasion ; a power that according to e full extent of the argument, is boundless and omnipo-nt; for the L\u00e9gislat\u00fare judged of the necessity of tire cases id also of the natu're and value of tihe equivalent. Such case of necessity and judging too of the compensation, n never occur in any nation; Singular indeed and unto-ird must be the state of things that would induce the Le-slature, supposing they had the power to divest one in- (jividual of bis landed estate, merely for the purpose \u00f3f vesting it in another, even upon full indemnification, unless indemnification be ascertained in the manner I shall mention hereafter,\n<e But admitting that the Legislature can take the real estate of A. and give it to B. on making compensation ; the principle and reasoning upon it go no farther than to shew that the Legislature are the sole and exclusive judges of the n\u00e9cessity of the case in which this despotic power should be called into action. It cannot on the principles of the social alliance or of the constitution, be extended beyond the power of judging upon every existing case of necesssby. The Legislature declares and enacts that such are the public exi-. gencies or necessities of the state as to authorise them to take the land of A. and give it to B. The dictates of reason and the eternal principles of justice, as well as the sacred principles of the social contract and the constitution, direct, and they accordingly declare and ordain, that A shall receive compensation for the land. But here the Legislature must stop; they have run the full length of their authority and can go no further. They cannot constitutionally determine upon the amouBt of the compensation or value of the land; public exigencies do not require; necessity does not demand; that the Legialature should of themselves, without the participation of the proprietor or intervention of a jury, assess the value of the thing, or ascertain the amount of the compensation to be paid for it.\u201d\nHere I will stop, though the judge continues to make many other remarks of great importance. Let us pause now a little and ruminate on the sentiments here delivered. They \u00e1re the genuine effusions of a mind devoted to liberty and ardently anxious to proclaim its true principies to the woi Id. It seeks to recommend them by shewing these principles in their native simplicity ; and are they not worthy in the most exalted degree of the admiration of every citizen ? Would to God I could exhibit them in their most engaging form ! How soon should 1 succeed in repelling the attempts that are inade to cover them in obscurity ! How soon would they be enshrined in l!ie temple of on the affections of the people from every danger ! be enshrined in l!ie temple of our hearts, and guarded\n.\u00ab No freeman ought to he deprived of his property but hy the\u2018 verdict of a jury or the law of the land,\u201d is a par\u00ed of the clause to be remarked on, which immediately respects the private rights of individuals. Other paits of it I shall pre. sently shew, respect the property of corporations as well as the personal liberty of the citizen. There is no doubt but the convention intended this clause as a restriction upon some of the branches of the government, which might otherwise use the powers prohibited. And what branch of the government was so much to be dreaded as the Legislature ? The authority of the Executive is too confined to have given cause for apprehension, and the authority of the Judges is here asserted, as I shall presently prove, not restrained or diminished. \u2014 The things here prohibited cannot be done but in courts of justice regularly constituted, and proceeding according to the known and steady modes of trial, used and practised in ail cases. I have heard if argued, that as the Legislature can make the law of the land by passing an act for that purpose, that therefore this Cause of the bill of rights, if taken as restrictive of the-? power, is of little or ho effect. And can there be a stronger argument to prove, that the term law of the land, lias seme other meaning ? Would the Convention, that wise body of men, when perfecting the'most important instrument that ever came under the consideration of a deliberative body, have intended to restrain the future Legislature, in matters of the most momentous concern, by a provision which they might render nugatory,at pleasure? Is it any way consistent with the dignity of that body or that noble love of liberty which characterised them to attribute to them such language as this: \u2014 These are powers too dangerous to be entrusted with the Legislature, and they shall not exercise them; but if they pass an act for the purpose, they may exercise ihem! T he words law of the land, therefore, mean some thing other than an act of the Legislature. If we resort its meaning to the history of the times in which it was **as^ li3et^ m national instruments, we shall discover its\u2019 genuine signification. It was first used in the 29 th article of the magna charra of England, extorted by (orce Irufm yle anj explicitly declaring the rights of the people in instances in which he had formerly violated them. It declared, n\u2019ot that these rights cund not be forfeited at all, but that they could not he forfeited at the will and pleasure of the executive, nor in oilier manner than by a lair trial in a court of justice by jury, where the facts were disputed, or where the facts were not disputed by such other modes as were agreeable to the law of the land or recognized by it. In either of which cases, the judgment of the regular tribunals of the country \"must be pronounced before the party could lose his rights. This was what was then and is now meant by the term law of the land. Sir Edward Coke, in' his 2d Institutes, page 60, expounds this sentence to mean due process of laxo. In Shower\u2019s Parliament Cases and Har-grave's preface to C. upon Litlieton, it.is expounded to refer to such eases as are not triable by the judgment of one\u2019s peers : And Sullivan, page 491 and pagt 493, explains it to mean modes of proceeding to judgment in a court of justice legally constituted ; which inodes are prescribed by law, and take place in cases where the trial by jury cannot be used ; for instance, if the party plead guilty or will not -appear, or suffer judgment by default, or if there be a demurrer upon ti'.e pleadings of the parties where ad matters of fact are truly stated and admitted by both parties, or where the court passes judgment for a contempt committed in the face of tiie court. In page 615, Mr. Suiljvan says, no freeholder shall he disseized of his freehold but by the verdict of a jury or the law of the land, as upon default, not pleading or being outlawed. The meaning then of the term we are considering, was that a man should not be deprived of his freehold, &c. but by the judgment of a court of justice regularly constituted and authorised to decide what tin* law is, and to pronounce it in cases coming before them; which court shall ascertain facts by the verdict of a jury, where proper, or where that would be improper by such other How different is this from means as the law has appointed the idea which makes every act of the Legislature a law of the land and vests in them the arbitrary and despotic power of prostrating ail those rights so dear to mankind whenever they please\u2019 The term \u201c Saw of the land\u201d had a precise legal meaning when used by the convention, and signified the lawful proceedings of the proper tribunals of the country. How much more for the advantage of the citizen is it, that this should be the meaning of the constitution than the other before adverted to J If a court of.jusMce injures an individual from unjustifiable, motives, the Judge who injures him may be impeached and removed from office; or he may early his case before a superior tribunal j but who shall procure bins redress against the Legislature ? The experience of ages evinces this truth, that the judiciary generally acts with coolness and reason; but it is known to all persons of political experience, that the best and most enlightened men when placed in large assemblies, will so far partake of the licafs of the moment, as frequently to concur in measures, which in their calm and retired moments they find much cause to regret. Had the Assembly the powers which are expressly denied them by this clause of the Constitution, there is reason to fear that many would be the victims of the indiscreet exercise of them. Whose property would be safe, or whose life, if an Assembly, infuriated by the opposition of party, as in the times ofCsesar and Pompe.y, or inflamed by artful accusations, or otherwise roused to act against individuals obnoxious to the public, could deprive them of either without further ceremony than that of passing an act for the purpose, and wiihout more responsibility than to the tribunal of their own consciences? Sue!) times of trouble may come upon us as they have come upon other nations, and it is the interest us well as duty of every good man to shut up as far as possible every avenue to cruelty, injustice and persecution, for w \u25a0 know not upon whom the evil is ts fail.\u2014 In such a state of things, with no bridle upon the \u00a1sa- jjgnant passions, how often should wo hoc the, mask of p itriotisui assumed as the prelude to sacrifice J ,w often should we see our best citizens sinking under ^)e we\u2019o^ of unprincipled prrsecutiou! Who is there jn tlie least acquainted with the excesses into which 11HJJjer{)HS a,,c apt to run, that would be willing to see the dangerous power I am contending against, vested in the Legislature. M ay I never see it yielded to them ; for then will my country be covered vidi the mantle, of mourning, and the spirit of confiscation, like that which appeared to Brutus, will follow on the footsteps of her patriots! Thank God, no man in North-Caroiina can he deprived of his life or property but by the regular judgment of a lawful court, who cannot oppress because they cannot originate any law of themselves, but act upon those made- by others. It is sometimes argued that the Constitution did not mean to hinder the Legislature, but all other persons and bodies of men Tom meddling with the individual rights specified in this 10th article, but that unlimited powers may be safely intrusted with the Legislature. Answer. The Convention clearly thought otherwise ; for the 24th section of the Bill of Rights prohibits the passing of any ex post facto law, and why ? doubtless from an apprehension, that if not prohibited to exercise such a power, it would be used to the injury of individuals. It was equally necessary and essential to liberty, that the property of individuals and their personal liberty should be guarded against the encroachments of the Legislature. This 10th section furnishes that guard, or it is not furnished at all; and this is a consideration which gives additional strength to the argument that this 10th section acts as a limitation upon the powers of the Legislature. As to private property, therefore, I may venture tp affirm it is beyond the reach of the Assembly, and cannot be taken from the owner by any act they can pass for the purpose.\nNeither can they take away the property of a corporation. It is remarkable that in the 10th section of the Bill of Rights, the word liberty twice occurs, once in the plural ami again J ' . . , 7 . T. in the singular; no freeman ought to he dtssei&ed of fits a-berths, &c. or deprived of his liberty hit by the verdict of a jiiny or the law of the land. A disseisin of liberties has a legal and technical meaning, well known to lawyers to be altogether distinct from the deprivation of personal freedom or the power of going whither we please ; it regards property and its possessor, while the other phrase, deprived of Ms liberty, regards his freedom from unjust confinement. Disseisin of liberties, must, in the opinion of the convention, mean something different from deprivation of liberty,,otherwise it would not have been used in the same, clause. It is a term which peculiarly signifies those privileges and possessions which corporations have by virtue and in consequence of the instruments which incorporate them. It is defined in 2 Bl. Com. 37, and Sullivan page 516, commentary upon the word liberties, used in the 29th article of the Magna Charta, from whence it has been translated into our Bill of Rights, says \u201c it signifies the privileges which some of the subjects, whether single persons or bodies corporate, have above others by the lawful grant of the King, as the chattels of felons or outlaws and the lands and privileges of ' corporations.\u201d It means therefore in our Constitution the possessions and privileges of corporations, and in conjunction with the other words of that article, amounts to this : that the possessions of a corporation, like those of an individual, shall not be taken away .but by the verdict of a jury or the judgment of a court of justice. If then the Trustees of the University be considered in the light of individuals, or of a common corporation, the property which they had acquired could not be affected by any act of the Legislature; nor could it be' taken from them, but by the judgment some proper court, having sufficient jurisdiction, and proceeding according to the known and established law of land.\nAnd if so, I would ask, is the University distinguished to its disadvantage from other corporations ? or is there any circumstance which renders its property less sacred than that of an individua] or common corporation ? It is a correct idea, that where the Assembly are dircc^ by the people in their constitution, to doNany special act, and they do it accordingly, the Assembly are to be con-sj(]ere(] ja rel.ation to that act, as the attornics of the people, appointed to do it, and consequently, that the act itself is to be considered as the act of ihe people: In like manner as a deed executed by my attorney, in my name, is my act and deed and not Ms. Thus if \u00e1 Judge or Attorney General is ,to he appointed, the Legislature as the at-tornies or agents of the people elect him ; but when he is elected, he is the officer of the people not of the Assembly ? and cannot be turned ot;t of office by them. How is (he case of the University different in principle from the case here put: The 40th section of the Constitution, directs that \u00ab A school or schools shall be established by the Legislature for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters tobe paid by the pxiblic as may enable them to instruct at low prices, and all useful learning shall be promoted and encouraged in one or more Universities. Now, when the-Legislature have, pursuant to this direction, erected and established an University, have they any more power over it, than they have over the judges? it not as much the work of the people as if they had es-biished it themselves by the constitution, without (he agen- or intervention of the Assembly ? surely it stands upon same basis as the Legislature itself does. It is as much will of the people, that there should be an University, that it should continue, as it is that there should be a Legislature. When the Legislature endowed it, they did as the organs of the people, and they cannot avoid the before they have received an authority from the peo-as express for its dissolution, as they had for its establishment. It may be said, the Assembly are directed to establish schools, and one or more Universities ; but not endow them, and th^i therefore they alone and not the people, have given the escheated and confiscated lands to the University. I answer, whenever a principal thing is directed to be done, all the necessary means of.doing it are given to the agent. An University cannot be established without funds, and therefore it is necessarily implied that they are to provide funds for it, as well as pass a law for bvinging it into existence. When the Assembly accordingly pointed out the escheated and confiscated property for this purpose; it from that nrnment became a gift of-the people, ratified through the' medium of their organ the Legislature | which none but the people assembled in convention can resume; It has been said this is a public institution for public purposes, and therefore is subject to the power of the Legislature, which is intrusted with the superin-tendance of all other public concerns within this state :\nI answer, the University like the seat of government is... JnstiHited for public purposes; but like that, is ordained by the constitution for this very reason, that it may not be subject to the vicissitudes of legislative opinion. The Legislature may regulate all thing? which pertain to the seat of government, but they cannot abolish it. So it is with respect to the University, they cannot abolish it, nor do any act which has a direct tendency to that end, such as taking away their funds. All that I need insist upon, however, is ibis.: that they cannot abolish the University itself \u2014 a position which none will deny. Then it is on the same footing as other corporations, .and the 10th article of the bill of rights secures all its property under the words \u00abno freeman shall be disseised of his liberties,\u201d &c. but by the law of the land. To avoid this consequence, it must be assumed, not only that the University is.undei the government of the Assembly, but also that its existence is dependant on their pleasure; for if like other corporations, its existence is independent '>f the Legislature, then so is its property, for that is secured1 by1 the same words which secures the property of other corporations. If the idea were correct, that they who can create can destroy, it would answer no purpose to the advocates for the power of the Assembly; unless they could a]30 sl!ew that the University is a creature of the Assembly. It is a creature of the people, who have used the As-as an agent to effectuate their will 5 which having once done, their authority upon this subject has ceased for- , . ever. The convention intended the University should he a permanent institution; and therefore they have riot left it to the discretion of the Legislature, but as a matter of the utmost moment 5 they have inserted it in the constitution ; and directed its creation, to the end that being a constitutional and not a legislative establishment, it should not be liable to those changes, which time produces in the conduct of Legislatures.\nTo say the least, the University is a corporation, as independent as other corporations are, and of course entitled to be as secure against the encroachments of the Legislature upon its properly and effects. Bat considering it as established by the people, and rendered sacred by a place in our constitution, for the very purpose of perpetuation, it seems impossible to doubt upon the subject before us, or to run the risque of mistake, in pronouncing, that the Assembly have no rigid to interfere with its property of any kind/ It is not true that whoever can create can destroy. In England the king can create and usually does create corpora- \u2022 tions; but he cannot destroy them at pleasure. My lord Coke, in his II Reports, page 99, gives us the reason. No freeman says he, of a corporation can be removed, but upon conviction by course of law 5 for he adds it is provided by Magna Charta, C. 29, that no one shall be disseized of his liberties, but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land; and 4 Report 57, proves that the king who created, can no otherwise proceed to the dissolution of a corporation, than by a due course of law, and by obtaining a regular judgment for that purpose. The same doctrine is held, 1 Bl. Com. 485. Then' it does not follow that because the Legislature could create, therefore it could destroy the Lniversity and take away its property. But it does follow that if the words used in Magna Charta, as restrictive 0: the power of the executive, are.used also in our bill of rights as restrictive of the power of the Legislature, that they must confine the Legislature licire in the same.manner they do the exccuiive in .England; and consequently that the Legislature cannot interfere with the University,' otherwise than by submitting to the judiciary of the country, whether or not they have been guilty of any such acts as. will in law amount to a forfeiture of their property, or toa dissolution of the body, constituted for the superiritendance of its affairs. Upon this view of the case 1 submit to the court that the law in question is against the constitution and void.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "Locke \u2014 Judge\ndelivred .opinion of the court.-\u2014 The Legislature of North Carolina in the year 1789, grant- \u25a0 cd to the Trustees of the University \u201c all the property that has heretofore or shall hereafter escheat to the,,state,\u201d And by another act passed in the year 1794, they also granted; \u201c The confiscated property then unsold.\u201d, By aii act passed in the year 1500, they declared, \u201c that from, and after the passing.of this act, all acts and.clauses of, acts, which have heretofore granted power to the Trustees of the University, to seize and posses* any.escheated or coin fiscated property, real \u00f3r personal, shall he and the same is hereby repealed and made void.\n(t-\u2018Andie it further enacted, That all escheated or confiscated property which the said trustees, their agents or at. torriies have not legally sold by virtue of the said laws, shall from,hence revert to the state, and henceforth be consider-, ed as the property of the same, ,as though such laws had never been passed.\u201d \u2014\nThe Trustees of the University in pursuance of the powers vested in them by the act of 1789, have brought this suit, to recover the possession of a tract of land escheated to the state, before the passing of the repealing act in the year 1800. The defendants have pleaded this repealing act jn bar, by which they allege the power of the trustees to support this action is entirely destroyed. It- is therefore considered how far the Trustees have title tinder the act of 1789, and in the next place, how far they are diof that title by the repealing act of 1830. \u25a0 .\u25a0\nTo determine the first question, it may be necessary to take into view the objections stated to the title of the Trus-teesi independent of the operation of the repealing act, and these are two: first, that no title to escheated lands' vests in the state until an inquisition or office found ; and secondly,' that if the state had title, yet the Trustees have derived none by the act of 1789, because the state attempted to convey the right by act of Assembly and not by grant as required by the 36th section of the Constitution. . With regard to the first objection, the court think it a sufficient answer to say, that on this subject the l\u00e1w has been suppoS* ed to be long settled, as this objection h\u00e1s been made in almost every suit heretofore brought by the Trustees of the University, and always overruled. The court approve of\u2019 the decisions upon this point, and will observe the ancient and wise maxim \u00ab stare decisis.\u201d 2 Black. 245, 2 Co. Rep. 52.\nAs to the second objection, the words of the constitution are, \u00ab all commissions and grants shall run in the name of the State of North-Carolina and bear test and be signed by the Governor,\u201d &c. It seems to be a fair and clear exposition of this part of the constitution to say, that when the stale conveys land by grant, the grant shall liave the requisites prescribed, to\u2019 wit, run in the name of the state,' bear teste and be signed by the Governor, &c. and that alb grants otherwise authenticated shall be void. It became necessary that the officer, whose duty it shall be to sign and authenticate grants, should he pointed out, and that their form and substance should be ascertained, in order to give uniformity to such grants and to avoid that variety which would be produced by the judgment of different officers* But the court see nothing in this clause restricting th\u00e9 Le gislature to this singly modo of conveyance ; they are left free from any control in the mode or manner of ing their property, unless they should adopt the one pointed out in the constitution, and then the form and ceremony are ' , .... _ _ _ prescribed. Tins opinion is warranted not only by the pressions contained in the clause itself, but by the many and repeated acts of Assembly passed, since the making o.f the Constitution, for the, purpose of transferring property. Many of these acts have been mentioned and referred to by the counsel for the lessors of the plaintiff. We are therefore of opinion that tl>e land in question vested in the state without an inquisition or office found, and that the Legislature were competent to pass the interest in the same to the Trustees of the University by the act of 1789 ; and that the Trustees have a good and valid title, unless the operation of the repealing act of 1800 has destroyed it.\nThe operation of this act is next to be considered ; and \u00a1f may be necessary to premise, that the people of North-Carolina, when assembled in convention,.were desirous of h iving some rights secured to them, beyond the control of the Legislature, and these they have expressed in the bill of lights and the constitution. The preamble to the constitution states among other things that \u00ab we the representatives of the freemen of Nortli-Carolina, chosen and assembled in Congress for the express purpose of framing a constitution, under the authority of the people, most conducive to their happiness and welfare, do declare, &c.\u201d Section 13th directs the General Assembly to elect several officers of state. Section 15th, directs the election of, a Governor. Section 38th, directs, that there shall be a Sheriff, Coroner or Coroners and Constables in each county. It became neces-savy for the Legislature to appoint these officers or to pass such laws as would secure to the people such officers as would carry this form of government into effect. The framers of this instrument appear to have been well sfbquainted with the importance and necessity of education, -and lest this object might escape the attention of the Legislature or be by them neglected^ section 4ist declares, \u201c That a school or schools shall be established by the Legislature for' the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters paid by the public as may enable them to instruct 4 * 1, J 1 at low prices; ami \u00e1li useful learning shall be encouraged an(| promo|-\u00bft\u00a1 \u00a1n one or more Universities\u2019.\u201d \u2018By this si\u2019ction as strong an injunction was imposed on the Legislature to establish an University as by the preceding clauses to appoint the several officers of government; these objects'seem to be regarded by the framers of the constitutiori'with equal solicitude; they have therefore in the same imperative style declared that there shall be an University',1 and that thoro shall be a governor, leaving to the Legislature to make such appropriations and create such funds for the endowment of, the institution as would- be sufficient- to effect the purposes, for which it should be established- \u2018 In the year 1789, the Legislature obeyed this\u2019constitutional injunction and made an appropriation of escheated lands and appointed Trustees for the management of the concerns of the institution. By the act of 1800, the Legislature declared that this property should be taken from the Trustees and revert to the state. Is then this last act authorised by the constitution, or does it destroy a right which that instrument gave to the people, * right highly .esteemed in all civilized nations, that of edu-eating their youth at a moderate expense? a right.of acquiring knowledge and good morals, which have always been deemed most conducive to the happiness and prosperity of a people?\nSome light will be thrown upon this subject by examining the nature of corporations, how property can be taken \u2022 from them, and how they can be dissolved. Corporations are formed for the advancement of religion, learning, cbiti-naerce.or other beneficial purposes. They are either aggregate 05 sole, and created by grant or by law. When they ^re once erected, they acquire many rights, powers, capacities .amf some incapacities, 1 Black. 495, as 1st, to have perpetual succession and therefore all aggregate corpora- dons have necessarily the power of electing members in the .room of those who die, to. sue and be sued and to do all oilier acts as natural persons. 2d. to purchase lands and to hold them for the benefit of themselves and successors, \u25a0 4th to nave a common seal. 5th. to make bye-laws for the Better government of the corporation. These corporations' cannot commit' crimes, although their members may in their individual capacity. The duties of those bodies consist iri acting up to the design-for which they were instituted. Let us next enquire liow their corporate property can be taken from them and ho.w they may be dissolved. A member may be disfranchised or lose bis place by his own improper conduct, or he may resign. A corporation may be dissolved by act of Parliament, which is boundless in its- operation; by the natural death of ail its members, in case of an aggregate corporation ; by surrender of its franchises into the hands of tljekiog; which is a kind of suicide; by forfeiture bf* its charter through negligence or abuse of its franchises, in which case the law judges the body politic to have broken the conditioh on which it was incorporated, and therefore the incorporation to be void ; and the regular course is to bring an information in the nature of a quo Warranto\u00bb to enquire by what authority the. members now exercise their corporate power, having forfeited it by such and such proceedings. 1 Bla.dc. 485, S Black. 2C3. None of these'prerequisites have been done in the present case. \u2014 We are then led to enquire into the soundness of an argument greatly relied on by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that those who create can destroy. The Legislature have not pretended to dissolve the Corporation, but to deprive them of a part of the funds, that were deemed to be vested in them, and to transfer those funds to the state. In England the king\u2019s consent to the creation of any corporation is absolutely necessary, either given expressly by charter or by'act of Parliament, where his assent is a necessary ingredieht or implied hy prescription. 1 Black. 472, 473. \u2018The king may grant to a sub. ject the power of erecting a corporation; and yet -it is the king that erects, the subjectjsbut the instrument. '1'Black\u00bb 474, Where there is an endowment of lands, the law dis-linguistics and makes two species of foundation; the first, mcipiens, or the corporation ; in which sense the king -\u2018s \u2018he founder of ail Colleges and Hospitals : the other, fundado prof.dens, or the dotation of it, in which sense the first gift of the revenues is the foundation, and who gives them is the founder : 1 Black. 4\u00a13t. \u2014 The constitution directed the General Assembly to establish this institution and endow it; then it would seem from the principle upon which all this doctrine is predicated, that the constitution and not the Legislature bad erected this corporation; the Legislature being only the agent or instrument, whose acts are valid and binding when they do pot contravene any of the provisions of the constitution. We view this corporation as standing on higher grounds than any other aggregate corporation ; it is not only protected by the common law, but sanctioned by the constitution. It cannot he considered that the Legislature would have complied with this conslituiional requisition, by establishing a school for a month or any determinate number of years, and then abolishing the institution ; because. the people evidently intended this University to be as permanent as the Government itself. It would not be competent for the Legislature to declare that there should be no public school in the state, because such an act would directly oppose that important clause in the constitution before mentioned. But if the Legislature can deprive the University of the appropriated and vested funds, they can do that which will produce the same consequences ; for deprive the institution of funds already vested and refuse to make any additional appropriations, there never can exist in the state a public school or schools ; and thus the Legislature may indirectly effect that purpose, which if expressed in the words before mentioned they conld not do. Besides, whew the Legislature have established an University, appointed Trustees and vested them with property which they were hold in trust for the benefit of the institution, have they discharged t heir duty as the agents of the people and transferred property which is afterwards beyond their corf- trol ? \u2014 From that moment the Trustees became in some measure the agents of the people, clothed with the power of disposing of and applying the property thus vested to the uses intended by the people, but over which the power of the Legislature ceased, with the discharge of the constitutional injuuc'hu); unless it might he necessary in the course of time to make other or further appropriations to continue and support the institution : and this we consider to bo their duty at all times, when such necessity shad exist, that the exportation ox the people, as expressed in the constitution may not be disappointed.\nBut one great and important reason whicli influences us in deciding this question, is the 10th section of the bill of lights, which declares \u201c that no freeman ought to be taken/ imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privile-. ges, or outlawed or exiled, or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty nr property, but by the law of the land.\u201d \u2014 It has been yielded on the part of the defend-, ants that if the Legislature had vested an individual with the property in question, this section of the bill of rights would restrain them from depriving him of such right: but it is denied that this section has any operation on corporations whose members are m\u00e9re naked Trustees, and have no interest in the donation, and especially on a corporation erected for a public purpose. It is also insisted that the term,\u00ab Law of the Land,\u201d does not impose any restrictions \u00f3n the Legislature, who are capable of making the Law of the Land, and was only intended to prevent abuses in the other branches of government. That this clause was intended to secure to corporations as well as to individuals the rights therein enumerated, seenis clear from the word \u201c liberties,\u201d which peculiarly signifies those privileges and rights which corporations have by virtue of the instruments which incorporate them, and is certainly used in this clause in contradistinction to the word \u201c liberty\u201d which refers to the personal liberty of the citjzen. We therefore infer that by this clause the legislature are as much restrained from affecting the property of corporations, as they are that of a private individua!, unless the expression, \u201cLaw of the Lan(j j> slioultf receive the construction contended for on the * part of the Defendant. \u2014 It is evident the framers cf the ; l- 1 , . constitution intended the provision as a restraint upon some ^,..,^\u00bf1, 0f t!10 government, either the Executive, Legisla\" tive, or Judicial. To suppose it applicable to the executive would be absurd on account of the limited powers conferred .on that officer; and from the subjects enumerated in that clause, no danger could bcapprehended, from the Executive Department, that being entrypted with the exercise of iio powers by which the principles thereby intended to be. secured could be affected. To apply it to the Judiciary, would, if possible, be still more idle, if the Legislature cair make the \u00ab Law of the Land.\u201d For the J udiciary are only to expound and enforce the law and have no discretionary powers enabling them to judge of the propriety or impropriety of laws.' They \u00e1re bound, whether agreeable to their ideas of justice or not, to carry into effect the acts of the legislature as far as they are binding or do not contravene the constitution. If then this clause is applicable' to the. legislature alone, and was intended asa restraint on their acts, (and to presume otherwise is to render this' article a dead letter,) let us next enquire, what will be the operation which this clause wiii^or ought to have on the present question. It seems to \u00fas to warrant a belief that members of \u00e1 corporation as well as individuals shall not be bo deprived of their liberties or property, unless by a trial by Jury in a court of Justice, according to the known and established rules of decision, derived from the common law, and such acts of the Legislature as are consistent with the constitution \u2014 and although th\u00e9 Trustees are a corporation established for public purposed* yet their property is as-completely beyond 'the control of the Legislature, as the. property of individuals or that of any other corporation, Indeed, it seems difficult to conceive of a corporation established fox1, merely private purposes. In every institution of th\u00e1t kind, the ground of. the establishment is some public good of purpose intended to be promoted $ but in many, tha members thereof hare, a private interest, ^coupled with the public object. In Ibis case,'.the trustees have vate interest beyond the general good: yet we conceive jthat circumstance will not make the property of the tees subject to the arbitrary will of the Legislature, The property vested in the Trustees must remain for the uses intended for the. University, until the Judiciary of the country in the Usual and common form, pronounce them guilty of such acts, as will, in l\u00e1w^ amount to a forfeiture of their rights or a dissolution of their body. The demurrer must therefore be allowed, and the plea in bar ovcruL ed,\nHall \u2014Judge\n\u2014Contra.\u2014A aquestion of more importance than that arising in this case, cannot come before a court. It is nothing less than one branch of the government undertaking to decide, whether another branch of the same government has or lias not transcended its constitutional powers $ a question which in its discussion should at all times command the best energies of the head and heart\u00bb When this shall be the case, although a difference of opinion may sometimes exist, it will be an honest one, and cannot fail to find its remedy in .mutual tolerance and concession. But well convinced, indeed, ought one person to be of another\u2019s error of judgment, before he passes sen-tcncc of condemnation on it, when he reflects that each has given the same pledges to support the constitution. Before a law enacted by the legislature should be pronounced unconstitutional, it ought to appear to the court to be palpably so : if an honest doubt can be entertained on the subject, we pwe it to ourselves as well as to the legislature, to carry it into effect. . Far be it from me, if it p?ere in my power, to damp that laudable and honest zeal, which cha-racterised the argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel; it cannot be too much extolled or too widely circulated: but I speak it with deference to the opinions of my brethren, that I think, occasions might occur, when its influence would be more happily felt and lead to more useful and correct re-suits. In the opinion which I have formed on this question I am probably mistaken, as I have the misfortune to differ from the rest of the court: but from the best consideration . . , ,. , I can give to it, I am bound to say, that I behove the law in qUeg^on jg uq! unconstitutional.\nI feel no disposition to controvert many things urged in argument by the defendant\u2019s counsel; he has had recourse, however, to one argument, which I think militates against him. It is drawn from the41st section of our constitution, which is in the following words : \u201c a school or schools shall be established by the Legislature, for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters, paid by the public, as may enable them to instruct at low prices : and all useful learning; shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one or more Universities.\u201d He endeavours to strengthen his general proposition, namely, \u201cThat any law taking away the property of an individual or a common corporation is unconstitutional,\u201d by stating, in addition, that there was a constitutional obligation on the Assembly to set apart funds for the support of the University; and if it were constitutional and right for them to do so, it is unconstitutional and wrong to take away those funds. If the framers of the constitution intended by that seciion that the Legislature should establish'one or more Universities and schools, and vest in them certain funds, which might be deemed sufficient at the time for their support in a constitutional view; if it were intended that by doing this, the Legislature had completely discharged their duty, and had nothing more to do with such schools and Universities,1 whatever misfortunes might afterwards attend them, there might be something in the argument. I think, however, this section of the constitution was intended for a very different purpose. It became the duty of the Legislature, created by and acting under that constitution, to establish seminaries of learning, with salaries to the masters, &c. and afterwards to support and cherish them as long as the con stitution shall exist. If by accident the funds set apart for their eiijjpovt should be destroyed, it would be the duty the Legislature to endow them with others. The Legisla-3 ture is the constitutional guardian of these seminaries of learning, and should at all times keep them under their in-spcction and control. This is a duty which they cannot de. legate or transfer to any one, and can only end with the constitution itself. Suppose then, that property should be given t\u00f3 the Trustees of the University (whom I consider, in no other light than as agents of the Legislature,) which property was not very productive, but sufficiently so for the' support of the University; and afterwards it were to become so much so, that one third of. the profits arising from it, would be adequate to the wants of the institution, who would have a right to the surplus ? \u2014 Let us reverse- the case and suppose the profits of property given to the Trustees to decrease or fail altogether; would it not be the duty of the Legisture to provide other funds or give other property which would be sufficiently productive ? I think it would. If so, can it be doubted, but that the surplus profits would be at the disposition of the Legislature ? It may be said that the Trustees have no surplus funds, that the profits of their property are not equal to the wants of the institution. That may be the case 5 but who is to judge of it ? I answer, not this court: the constitution gives it no such power. The Legisture must, be the j udge. It would be going too far to say, that there was a constitutional obligation on the Legislature to do a certain thing, and that this court and not the Legislature should decide when it was properly done. If, then, the Legislature must judge how large the funds of the University ought to be, add to them when they.., are too small and take from them when too large, this court, are not the proper judges in such cases : and if not, how can we undertake to say that the law in question is unconstitutional ? It cannot, I think, be denied that the General Assembly have a right to take from the Trustees property of which the University stands in no need, and that f0P the best of reasons; because they are bound to furnish it with additional funds, as those which it already possesses decrease, or as its wants may increase. 1 have said that the General Assembly cannot delegate this constitu-_ . , \" tional power; that is, that they cannot, by giving to the Trustees any quantity of property or any given sum of money exonerate themselves from the trust and confidence which the constitution reposed in them. ' It is true they may appoint Trustees as their agents Co act for them, and tlicit Trustees or agents are amenable to them for their conduct; they have a naked authority without any interest. The law' can have no hearing upon them as individuals; it can Only affect them in their public character as Trustees. And'' how is it to do this ? They were entrusted with property' for the purpose of supporting an University in conformity with the directions of- the constitution, and the General Assembly are about to take this property from them, which they contend they have no bight to do?!If the Assembly arc hound in any event to furnish' funds 'to support the University, they have a right to takeaway surplus funds. If it be said that the property in question is not of that description, I answer, who are to judge of' this, but the General Assem-, lily, on whom there is a Constitutional obligation to establish and superintend an University ? On the Trustees, no such, obligation is imposed: they are the mere agents of the Legislature ^ and as wrnll might it he said that any other citizens equal in number to the Trustees should be placed paramount to the Legislature. I therefore can see no analogy between this cash and that of a gift made to an individual or to an ordinary corporation. My opinion upon the whole case, is founded upon the provisions of the constitution, and regarding the Trustees as mere agents for the management of the concerns of the University under the direction of the Legislature, I think the demurrer should he overruled and the plea in bar sustained,\nCh. 21, Sec. 2\nCh. 3, Sec. 1 \u2014\nCh. 5.", "author": "Locke \u2014 Judge Hall \u2014Judge", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["Den on demise of the Trustees of the University North-Carolina vs. Foy and Bishop"]}}}

Marshall\u2019s administrator and devisee.\nPending' a suit against A. as security of E, A, to defeat any recovery that might be made ag'ainst Mm in said suit, conveys his property to C, by an absolute deed, purporting to be for a valuable consideration. And it was agreed between A: and C, that C should recon-vey the property to A, whenever, he should be requested. It appeared upon the trial of the suit against A, that the debt claimed of him had been paid by B, for whom he was security, and judgment was rendered in favour of A : upon which he filed a bill to compel C. to reconvey the property according to his agreement. Equity will not enforce tliis agreement, on account of its moral turpitude.\nThe bill charged that Jackson, in order to the more convenient settlement of his estate at a future day, so as to answer the exigencies of his family, concluded to raise a trust in fee on his estate, and to make such divisions and provisions out of the same, as a trust is capable of according to the rules of Equity, and which an estate at Common Law is not. That to this end, he applied to one Benjamin Marshall, late of Halifax county, now deceased, and made known to him his designs, and requested him to permit Complainant to make him a trustee for the said purposes : that Marshall consented thereto, and promised that he would, from time to time, make such conveyances as Complainant should direct, and rcconvey the property to Complainant if ever requested to do so. That in pursuance of this agreement, Complainant, in May 1801, by deed duly executed, conveyed to Marshall two tracts of land, lying in Halifax county; and by another deed executed about the same time, he conveyed to Marshall all his stock of cattle, horses, hogs, and all his other property, including negroes Hercules and Lydia. The bill ciiarged that the conveyances were upon trust, for the benefit of the Complainant, and that the said trust was declared by Marshall, %t and after the execution of the conveyances; that all the said- property was by express agreement to be at Complainants disposal,' and lie was to take the profits and proceeds thereof, and Marshall was to convey the same at any time, as Complainant should direct : that although a consideration was expressed in the conveyances, none was ever paid by Marshall for the property. That Marshall had since died, having duly executed his last will, and therein devised the lands aforesaid to his son, Howell Marshall, and the other property he directed in his will to be sold, and the proceeds divided amongst his other children : that Jeremiah Marshall had caused the will to be proved, and administration with the will annexed to be granted to him : that he and the said Howell Marshall denied the trusts aforesaid, and pretended that the conveyances aforesaid were intended by the parties to be absolute, and subject to no secret trust. The bill prayed that they might be compelled to answer, and be decreed to reconvey the lands and other property to Complainant.\nTo this bill, Jeremiah Marshall, the administrator, put in his answer, and therein alleged, that he had no personal knowledge of the transactions charged in the bill, but believed, from every information which he had been able to acquire, that the conveyances were intended by the parties to be absolute; that a considerable part of the purchase money had been paid by Benjamin Marshall, previous to his death, and that Complainant held his bonds for the balance.\nThis cause coming on to be heard in the Court of Equity for Halifax district, sundry issues were submitted to a Jury, who found, that the conveyances mentioned in the bill were upon trusts, and not intended to be absolute ; that they were made to defeat any recovery that might be made in a suit then pending in Halifax Superior Court against Complainant, as security for one Co-field, in which suit the Plaintiff failed to recover, it appearing that the debt was paid by Cofield before the in stitution of said suit. The Jury also found, that Comp! ainaht,.M the .time of executing the said conveyances, , Was-indebted toupbe Burt, and al^o to one Hilliard, to a amoub^bfft.that those debts bore a small propor-theva&ic of bis estate,, and that creditors were not ialcftded- to be defrauded by said conveyances, or hindered or delayed thereby of the recovery of their debts.\nThe bill, answer, and findings of the Jury, were sent to this CourH\u00f3r the opinion of the Judges.\nThis, with the preceding case of Vick and others against Flowers, was argued by Cameron and Williams, (Chatham,) for the Complainants, and by Browne and Norwood for the Defendants.\nCameron, for Complainants. \u2014 In making a decree in the case of Jackson against Marshall\u2019s administrator and devisee, the Court will take into consideration the facts found by the Jury, unless the testimony offered upon the trial was improperly received. The bill seeks to enforce a trust which the Jury have found, but which does not appear upon the face of the conveyances. Can this trust be proved by parol evidence, when the parties have purposely omitted it in the deeds i And if proved, will Equity enforce it ? As to the first question, there can be no doubt but that parol evidence is to be admitted to prove a trust, where it is omitted to be inserted in a deed by fraud, accident or mistake; but where the trust is omitted purposely, the Court will be governed by the particular circumstances of the case, and will receive or reject the evidence, as will best subserve the ends of justice. This seems to have been the opinion of President Pen dleton, in the case of Ross against Norvell, 1 Wash. 1 Norvell filed a bill-to redeem certain negroes which, li\u00e9. r' charged, he had mortgaged to Ross, to secure the pay-fljjiW ment of a debt due to him. The negroes were conveyed! by an absolute bill of sale, with a warranty, and a receipt for the consideration stated in the deed was endors ed thereto. The bill charged, that' the conveyance, though absolute in form, was intended \u00e1s a s\u00e9curity, and that it was verbally agreed at the tim\u00e9, that Norvell. might redeem at any time, upon payment odthe priiffcipal and interest. Ross, in his answer, insisted that thte\u2019Sftl\u00e9 was absolute, and was intended as a satisfaction of a prior debt due to him from Norvell. Parol evidence was received to prove the verbal agreement, and Norvell was permitted to redeem the negroes. The President of the Court of Appeals, in delivering the opinion of the Court, entered at large into the consideration of the question, Whether parol evidence could be admitted to set up this verbal agreement in contradiction to the deed ? And after an examination of the several cases upon this point, observed, \u201c that the general principles of these cases prove, that parol evidence, where there is a deed, is not to be admitted in all cases, nor refused m all, and that every case must depend on its own circumstances.\u201d It is true, that in that case Norvell was suffered to remain two years in possession of the negro\u00e9s, and this being contrary to the ordinary effect of a sale, was noticed by the Court, as a circumstance that gave an impression of a trust of some kind, between the parties. But the Court observed, that this circumstance rendered the difficulty less of admitting the parol proof,- from which it is to be inferred, that without it, such proof would have been received. Indeed, as between the parties to the deed, such proof will seldom be refused ; there-Is much reason to receive it with caution where the rights of third persons are to be affected.\nAs to the second question, Whether Equity will enforce the trust, if proved ? it may be observed, that the Courts of Equity in this State have enforced such trusts. The Jury have found, that the conveyances were not made to defraud creditors, nor to hinder or delay them in the recovery of their debts. They were, made to defeat a recovery that might be made, as Marshall apprehended,\nin the suit then pending against him 5 but as the Plaintiff failed to recover, upon the ground that nothing was due to him,' he cannot he considered a creditor, whoso debt was to be defeated by the conveyances. It has been decided, that to set aside a conveyance, under the statute against fraudulent conveyances, it must appeat* that the person making the conveyance was a debtor, and the person to be defeated his creditor. For the statute speaks of persons indebted, and makes void the conveyances which shall be made by them to defeat, hinder or delay their creditors in the recovery of their debts.\nBrowne, for the Defendants. \u2014 Parol evidence cannot be admitted, to set up the trust which the Complainant seeks to enforce. The deeds upon their face purport to be made for a valuable consideration, and in 1. Fes. 128, Lord Hardwicke declares, that where a deed mentions that it was made for a valuable consideration, no evidence can be received to shew that it was made for any other consideration; for this would be to admit parol evidence to contradict a deed. In the present case, the deed declares that it was made- for Marshall\u2019s use and the use of his heirs, &c. Can parol proof be admitted to contradict this ? 3 Wills. 275, 1 Br. Ch.- 92, shew that it cannot. The rule is, that paro'l evidence may be admitted, where the fact to be disclosed by it, and w inch creates the trust, has been left out of the deed by fraud, accident, or mistake; and the Court of Equity gives relief here, upon the ground of its ancient jurisdiction over cases of fraud, accident, or mistake. To admit such evidence in other cases, would be to add to, detract from, or explain a deed. This question has been often decided, and in Henry Black. 659, there is a case in point, shewing that parol proof cannot be received as to any thing dehors the deed, unless it appear to have been left out by fraud, accident or mistake.\nBut if the proof be received, the trust which it proves is founded in such iniquity, that Equity will not enforce it. Equity will not enforce a contract, nor a Court of Law give damages for the breach thereof, where the consideration of such contract is illegal. This is the general. principle to be extracted from various decided cases, particularly 3 Term, Rep. 454 \u2014 4 Id. 466. Assumpsit is an equitable action, in which damages are recovered for the breach of such contracts as Equity will enforce. Equity cannot decree against a positive rule of Law \u2014 2 Com. Big. 475-6. And if the rules of Law forbid a recovery for the breach of the contract, they likewise forbid the enforcement of the contract in Equity. In 4 Term Rep. 329, the principle upon which the Court always acts, in cases like the present, is laid down by Lord Kenyon : \u201cNo person shall take the chance of committing a fraud, without running the risk of losing by it, when he is detected.\u201d Upon this principle, an alteration in a bond or note avoids it, and a fraudulent conveyance is made good against the party making it.\nIf a voluntary conveyance be made, with a view to being indebted at a future time, it is fraudulent \u2014 \u00a3 Mk. 481 \u2014 3 Ves.jun. 461. Sometimes there is no debt until judgment is obtained \u2014 2 Bl. Com. 436. A judgment recovered for criminal conversation entitles one to set aside a fraudulent deed \u2014 Tree. Ch. 103 \u2014 1 Eq. M. 149. The statutes against fraudulent conveyances cannot receive too liberal a construction \u2014 Cowp. 434.

The object of the Law is to put an cud to all trust and confidence between persons disposed to commit a fraud.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "Weight, Judge,\ndelivered the following opinion, as the opinion of the Court in both of the preceding cases:\nIt is rather a singular circumstance, that claims, such as the present bills set up, are made at this day, and at tempted to be enforced without theiauthority of a single adjudged case to support them. That conveyances like those set forth, made* under similar agreements, have before occurred, there can be little doubt; and it is equally certain, that if these agreements had ever been considered as entitled to the assistance of a Court of Equity, the diligence and industry of the Complainant\u2019s counsel would have discovered the cases in which application to enforce them had been sustained, and relief granted. The silence of the Books on the subject, would seem oi\u2018 itself to affordwstrong presumptive evidence, that the Complainants are not entitled to the relief which they seek. But although such presumption exists, yet if they eould have shewn, that under the influence of any of those principles which direct the decisions of our Courts of Equity, they were entitled to relief, the Court would feel bound to grant it, notwithstanding it might seem to militate against the policy of the statutes which have been, from time to time, made for the protection and security of creditors. It is believed, that so far from granting relief to the Complainants, not only the statute against fraudulent conveyances, but every principle and rule which has been adopted and matured in Courts of Equity, for the purpose of suppressing fraud and of inculcating a course of fair and honest dealing among men, directly forbid 'it. The'* Complainants\u2019 counsel rested their arguments much on the nature of trusts in the Civil Law, from which they have been taken and adopted into our Jurisprudence by the Courts of Equity; and cases were cited to shew, that by that Law, they were enforced, although they had originated in fraud on the part of the cestui que trust. To this it is a sufficient answer to say, that although the Courts of Equity may have derived. their idea of a trust from the Civil Law, yet that that Law lias no binding force or authoritative influence on these Courts, _twhich are guided altogether by a set of rules and. principles, peculiarly their own, that have gifown out of the condition and positive institutions \u00aef the country where they have been established. The Com\u2018plainants\u2019 claim will derive very little w eight from the consideration that it would have been enforced by a Roman Praetor, if it 'be opposed by'any of these rtiles or principles. Some reading is also cited from Saunders on Uses, and Reeves's History of the English Law, to shew that trusts originated in covin, and that on their first introduction, they were applied to what might be deemed fraudulent purposes; that is, to avoid the statutes of mortijhaifti. But it is to be observed, that the clerical Chancellors who presided in the Courts of' Equity at that time, did not consider these conveyances as dishonest or against conscience, and rather leaned in favor of them, and enforced the secret trusts which arose out of them, and which produced a variety of acts of Parliament that were deemed necessary to prevent the fraudulent purposes to which they were applied : among others,. the 13th aiid 27 th of Elizabeth \u2022, of the former, our act of. 1715 is nearly a copy. The Complainants\u2019 counsel, however, contend, that although the statute makes the conveyances to which it. alludes void, yet that it does not give validity to any thing, and hence an inference is drawn, that when a'debt is discharged, to delay the payment of which a conveyance or secret trust is made,'the conveyance ceases to be binding, and the debtor becomes entitled to a reconveyance. But this argument is cer-' tainly unsound $ for although the statute does not validate any thing in express terms, it does by a very strong implication. It declares, \u201c that all \"and every feoffment, gift, grant, alienation, bargain and conveyance of lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods and chattels,\u201d &c. made for the purposes, or with the intent stated in the preamble, shall henceforward be deemed and taken \u201c only as against that person or persons, his or their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and every of them, whose fictions, suits, debts, accompts, damages, penalties and forfeitures, shall release by such c\u00f3viuous or fraudulent devices and practices, as is aforesaid, or shall er^ngbt be in any wise disturbed, hindered, delayed or defrauded, to be clearly and utterly void, frustrate and of.no effect; any pretence, colour, feigned consideration, expressing of use, or any matter or thing to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d As to the parties themselves, therefore, it must mean, that it shall be taken to be good ; for that which would otherwise be1 good, and is declared void only as to a certain intent, remains good to all other intents 5 and that such has been the construction- which the statute has heretofore received, may be gathered not only from the opinion of elementary writers on the subject, but from adjudged cases in the English Courts, and in our own\u20142 Bac. Mr. 605-Fonblanque on Equity, 139\u2014Roberts on Fraudulent Conveyances, 643\u2014Cro. Jac. 270\u20141 Ch. Ca. 59\u20142 Hayw. 348. In the case cited from Cro. Jac. the alienee was permitted to recover at Law from the executors of the debtor, the property conveyed, on the ground, that although the conveyance was void as to creditors, (it being made to defraud them of their debts) yet that it was good as against the person making it, and his representatives. But supposing.no adjudged casp or elementary opinion could be- found in support of such -a construction, yet the object and spirit of the Law would seem evidently to require it. ...The.design and intention of the act was the protection and security of creditors 5 this can only be effected by destroying all confidence between the parties to secret agreements ; by multiplying the difficulties which fraudulent debtors would have to-encounter in attempting to defeat their clai^ft; and denouncing every species of, forfeiture and risfc against such attempts, which can be .raised up against them in a Court of Equity. The act of Assembly, therefore, would seem a complete answer to the claims of the Complainants. But independent of the act, the claims are in direct opposition to some of the \u00edm>St fundamental maxims which direct and influence the conscience of a Chancellor. He who hath done iniquity, shall not have Equity \u201e\u2022 He who requires the aid of a Court of Equity, must disclose a fair and honest transaction \u201e\u2022 are maxims which have never been departed from, aud ar,e |n ti\u00a1rect hostility to the claims of the Complainants. It is true, that Francis, in his exposition of the first maxim, says that the iniquity must be done to the Defendant himself, and this exposition was much relied on by the Complainants\u2019 counsel. But this exposition is certainly incorrect, nor does the case cited by Francis for the purpose, prove it. He cites a case where a person, during the great rebellion, who, in order to avoid a . sequestration by the usurper, had sworn, in an answer in Chancery, that he had been satisfied for a debt, was permitted to recover by a Chancellor sitting after the restoration ; and who, no doubt, held that the opposition to the claim was more unconscientious than the means taken to avoid the sequestration. The true exposition of the maxim is to be found in 1 Fonbl. ch. 4, sec. 13, where, after stating it, he says, \u201c But this must be understood where such person is Plaintiff,\u201d &c. And the following adjudged cases illustrate it: 2 Vern. 602\u20141 Ch. Ca. 202\u20141 Vern. 475\u20142 Ves. 156. The case of Gale v. Lendo, 1 Vern. 475, was a case where the party against whom relief was sought, was in no wise to be injuriously affected by the transaction, in as much as she had received the money for the bond which she had given to her brother on her marriage. The obligor,, however, was not permitted to recover, because he had taken it with a fraudulent intention to operate against her husband,/who had died ; and although he was not affected by it, nor could his estate be made liable for it, yet as it was givpn originally for a fraudulent purpose, it was void as against all persons. This case is also ah answer to the argument of the counsel, which went to shew that although a fraud was contemplated, yet none was effected, and that therefore no forfeiture should attach against Complainants. The fraud consists, not in the actual injury sustained by the person intended to be injured, but in tlie act itself, and the turpitude of the motive which influenced the party to its commission; p,nd that which was once a fraud always remains a fraud \u2014 1 Vern. 475.\nIt would therefore seem, from this view of the cases, that so far from Complainants\u2019 being entitled to relief upon any ground of Equity, they are opposed not only by the statute against fraudulent conveyances, but also by the maxim, that he who hath done iniquity, shall not have Equity; and by the principle, that no Plaintiff is entitled to the aid of a Court of Equity to enforce a contract entered into with a fraudulent intention, and for a fraudulent purpose. This renders it unnecessary to consider the other part of the cases, that is, whether parol proof.should be admitted to prove the private agreement; for if this agreement had been reduced to writing, with all possible solemnity, it would not have received the aid of a Court of Equity for a specific performance. \u2018 The bills must therefore be dismissed.

That in that part which states the mortal wounds, the stroke is only laid by implication. 2. That the indictment does not set forth the length and depth of the mortal wounds.\nPotter, for the Attorney-General,\nargued this case on behalf of the State. \u2014 As to the first exception. It is laid down as a general rule, that certainty is requisite in all indictments \u2022, and the reasons given are, 1st. That the prisoner may know against what he has to defend himself : 2d. That it may be a bar to a future prosecution : 3d. That the Court may know the punishment due to the offence : and, by some writers, 4th. That the Court may know what it is that the Grand Jury have found. In Law, there are three kinds of certainty : Certainty to a certain intent in general; certainty to a common intent ; and certainty to a certain intent in every particular. This last is rejected in all cases, as partaking of too much subtilty $ the second is sufficient in defence \u2022, the first is required in a charge or accusation.5\u2019 Is not the present indictment certain to a certain intent in general ? Lord Hale observes, \u201c that abbreviations, such as are usual, are allowable in bills of indictment, and shall be construed singularly or plurally, as makes best for t|ie maintenance of the indictment.\u201d Hawkins says, ((a d0fect js helped by the apparent sense of the whole;\u201d and, \u201c that the Law will not suffer a criminal to escape on so trifling an exception as would be ahsurd and ridiculous to take notice offor nimia subtilitas in jure reprobatur.\u201d\nIt is admitted that the manner of giving the mortal wounds, amd the intent with which they were given, must be laid positively, or by way of allegation, and not depend upon argumentative certainty. But what is meant by an allegation of the mortal stroke, is explained in Lad\u2019s case, and is just such an allegation v is made in this bill. Here the charge of giving the mortal stroke, is joined by the copulative and to the preceding sentence where the assault is charged, and unites with the \u201c malice aforethought\u201d of that sentence \u2022, the words then and there refer the stroke to the time and place of the assault; and the same words following the word giving, refer.the\u2019 mortal wounds to the time and place of the assault and striking; the first allegation of assaulting and striking is carried on throughout the sentence. It would have been useless to repeat the stroke where the mortal wounds are charged, for the sense is the same without the repetition. Language is never rendered more-perspicuous by tautology. As to the-case of poisoning, cited from 2 Hawk. c. 23, s. 82, and 2 Hale 184, the allegation was, that the deceased \u201c accepit et bibit\u201d omitting the words e<venenum prcediclum\u201d There, it is clear, that the deceased drank the poison aforesaid, only by intendment. The precedents in the Cro. Cir. Comp. 484-5, 491-3, and in the appendix to 4 Black. Com. support the present indictment as to the first exception.\nAs to the second exception \u2014 Why shall the length and depth of the wounds be set forth in the indictment ? No reason can be given why they . should be described, un~ less it be to inform the Court that they are mortal. And is not the Court as well informed now as if a more particular description had been given ? What additional information could the Court derive as to the mortality of the wounds, from an allegation that they were an inch long and one quarter of an inch in depth ? If the wounds had been thus described, and upon the trial it had appeared that the description were incorrect, that the skin of the head had not been separated, the Jury would have been instructed to disregard this variance between the description and the fact. If one man, with his fists and feet, knock and kick another on the body until he die, the wounds or bruises in such cases are never described $ and can the Court perceive more mortality in wounds thus inflicted, than in those which are inflicted on the head, by a heavy stick ?\nThe only reason given for describing the dimensions of the wound is, that the Court may be informed that the wound is mortal. Where the reason fails, the law ceases... Where it is impossible to describe the wound, the description is dispensed with. There are exceptions to the rule requiring the dimensions of the wound to be described. These exceptions are founded upon principle, and those which we meet with in the books are not put as the only exceptions, but as .examples illustrative of the principles on which the exceptions are founded. The . case of bruises is not mentioned in the enumeration of exceptions ; yet because it comes within the reason, it is held to be unnecessary to describe wounds of that nature. So should it be unnecessary in the present case, because this is the case of bruises, and is in fact so charged; for a wound with a stick is a bruise. \u2018\u2018Wound\u201d is a hurt given by violence, no matter with what kind of weapon. \u201c Bruise\u201d is a hurt with something blunt and heavy. Wound includes a bruise. As therefore the present charge is of wounds with a stick, they must be taken to be such wounds as a stick commonly inflicts. Is it competent for the prisoner to object to the use of a word in one of its proper significations ? It is admitted on his behalf, that if the word \u201cbruises\u201d had been used jn this indictment, instead of the word \u201c wounds,\u201d no description would be required: but if every wound includes a bruise, why shall that word, in this indictment, be stripped of its ordinary extent of meaning ? The word wound is not a technical word ; it is one of com tnon parlance. If this word, ex vi termini, imported a separation of the skin, and was confined in its signification to injuries of that character, then it might be alleged that it always differed from a bruise, and did not include it. But it is clear, that in common parlance, and also in judicial decisions, wound and bruise are used as synoni-mous. In 4 Com. Dig. 381, it is said that \u201c plagam seu contusionem is well.\u201d See also 2 Hale, 186. If, then, \u2022wound be not a technical word, (and it is not pretended that bruise was ever considered as a word of art) why restrict the Attorney-General to the use of one of these. words ? The Counsel for the prisoner has shewn, that both plaga and vulnus signify (in Law at least) a wound or bruise. Then, take the present bill, either by sentences or by its context, and it will be found clear, certain and intelligible. There is much good sense in the remarks of Lord Ellenborough upon the case of \u201c the King v. Stephens and Agnew.\u201d \u201c Every indictment, (says lie,), ought to contain a complete description of such facts and circumstances as constitute the crime, without inconsistency or repugnancy; and, except in particular cases, where technical expressions are required to be used, there-is no rule that other words shall be employed than such as are in ordinary use; or, that in indictments or other pleadings, a different sense is to be put upon them than what they bear in ordinary acceptation. And if, where the sense may be ambiguous, it is sufficiently marked bv the context, or other means, in what sense they are intended to be used, no objection can be made on, the grouftd of repugnancy, which only exists where a sense is annexed to words, which is either absolutely inconsistent therewith, or, being apparently so, is not accompanied by any thing to explain or define them. If the sense be clear, nice exceptions ought not to be regarded.\u201d\nThe case of the pirates tried in the Federal Court, before Judge Patterson, if it be law, is decisive of this question. The indictments are filed away among the records of that Court here, and they have been examined. There the Defendants were convicted on two bills: one charging the death to have been produced by a wound with an axe on the head, and no dimensions of the wound were given; the other, by an axe on the shoulder, and throwing overboard, and no dimensions of the wound by the axe, although the bill did not charge that the death had happened by drowning. As the allegation there was, that the wound was given by an axe, a sharp edged instrument, it was more necessary to describe it, than in the present case, where the wound was inflicted with a stick; yet after argument, the Court held the indictments good, and the convicts were executed.\nThe Judges were unanimous in opinion, that the first exception taken to the indictment could not be supported : and upon this point,\nThe reporter regrets that he is not able to give the very able argument of Mr. Seawell in support of these objections.\nCo.

We disclaim all right of giving to them a rigorous construction, to aid the prisoner\u2019s acquittal, or of relaxing their true meaning, to effect his condemnation. Like every other citizen in his situation, he is entitled to the full benefit of the constitutional provisions, devised to promote the security of all: and though the most atrocious criminal ity may have been proved to the s\u00e1tisfaction of the Jury#' yet legal condemnation ought never to be separated froiii legal proofs. And we cannot too strongly impress it on our minds, that want of the requisite precision and certainty, which may, at one time, postpone or ward off the punishment of guilt, may, at another, present itself as the last hope and only asylum of persecuted innocence. It must, however, be confessed, that there is, in the ancient reasoning on this branch of the Law, a degree of metaphysical and frivolous subtilty, strongly characteristic of the age in which it was introduced ; when at the revival of letters, the first efforts of learning were laborious and rude, and scarcely a ray of common sense penetrated the clouds of pedantry. Were a system now to be established, it is probable that much of the jargon of the Law would be exploded, and that no objection would prevail against an indictment, or any other instrument, which conveyed to the mind, in an intelligible form, its intended impression. But we must follow in the footsteps of those who have preceded us, until the Legislature think fit to interfere; though we have no wish to extend the particularity further. On this subject, the sentiments of an eminent Judge have been properly read by the Counsel for the State; since, although he was conspicuous for his tenderness to criminals, as well as for every manly and Christian virtue, yet he condemned this nicety as a reproach to the laws. We would also refer to the opinion of another illustrious man delivered a century afterwards; a man who had devoted a long life to the cultivation of the science he so ably dispensed.\nThe first exception taken to this indictment is, that in that part of it which states the mortal wound, the stroke is only laid by implication.\nThe rule laid down by the writers is, that where the death is occasioned by a wound, bruise or other assault, the stroke should be expressly laid. In every case, however, where the objection has been heretofore taken, there is an omission of the express charge of the stroke, in that part of the indictment wherein it is charged in this. In Long\u2019s case, the word \u201c discharged\u201d is used. There seems to be ho case, where a repetition of tiie stroke is required after the participle giving, if it has been directly charged in the preceding clause.\nA critical examination of Long\u2019s case, supposing it to be of good authority, which is by no means certain, will shew that instead of supporting, its tendency is to repel the exception in this case. The material words of the indictment, necessary to be taken into view, in Long\u2019s case, were \u201c that the aforesaid H. D. a certain pistol, &c. loaded with powder and a leaden bullet, &c. in and\" upon the said II, Long discharged, giving to the said H. Long then and there with the leaden bullet aforesaid, so as aforesaid sent forth from the said pistol by the said H. D. one mortal wound, &c.\u201d The Court \"in giving judgment, divided the objection into two parts : 1st, the clause before the words \u201c giving him 2d, the clause containing these words : and they resolved that the first clause was not sufficient of itself j for although H. D. discharged the pistol upon him, it may be that he was not struck by it. Then thd second clause cannot make it good, for the clause of \u201c giving,\u201d &c. depends on the said first clause, and describes the wound only to shew it to be mortal, which ought to appear by the first \u25a0sentence to be given ; because in that case, the participle determines the verb. But here it did ,not appear by the first clause that a stroke was given, and then ee giving,\u201d &c. cannot supply it; for that is a participle depending upon the verb precedent, and the verb precedent is <6 discharged,\u201d and f< discharged\u201d may be without a stroke. Although the grammar and logic of that case are refined, yet the Court do not in their reasoning intimate the necessity of inserting after the participle \u201c giving,\u201d the manner, the quo modo of the wound. Their opinion is, that if there had been a direct allegation of a stroke in the first clause, the participle \u201c giving\u201d would have connected it with the second clause, and made the indictment good. But the decision was not approved of in after times \u2022, for Lord Ilolt said, that by his consent they would not be so nice again, and that there was not a case in the law like that $ and its authority is admitted to be considerably shaken in a recent case.\nTo sustain this exception, would be to establish a precedent more-exceptionable than that in Long\u2019s case$ and instead of promoting perspicuity and simplicity of language in indictments, would seem only to introduce tedious and perplexing tautology. Yet this is not required even in the statement of those terms of art so peculiarly appropriated to the description of particular offences, that they cannot be supplied by any circumlocution. For where the indictment charged that A. feloniously and of his malice aforethought assaulted B, and with a sword, &c. then and there struck him, &c. the first allegation of feloniously and of his malice aforethought applied to the assault, ran also to the stroke to which it is essential. An indictment against'Mary Nicholson for poisoning Elizabeth Atkinson, stated that the prisoner did wilfully, feloniously, and of her malice aforethought, mix poison, viz. white arsenic with flour and milk, with the intent that the same should be afterwards taken and eaten by the, deceased, and the said flour and milk so mixed with the poison as aforesaid, then and there delivered to the deceased, &c. This was holden sufficient by all the Judges, without adding the words <s feloniously and of her malice aforethought\u201d ,to the allegation of delivering the poison. For they considered that these words ran by the word \u201c and,\u201d and the words \u201c then and there.\u201d But if the sentence had not been so connected, a different construction would have prevailed.\nThe indictment before us contains a direct allegation of a stroke accompanied with the necessary terms of art, and all the sentences are connected together by the words and anti then and there: so that in all these respects it bears the strict form of carrying forward from one sentence to another the criminal charge. Further repetition might have obscured, but could n.ot have illustrated the charge, nor could it have brought the indictment nearer to the most approved precedents. On this point, therefore, tiie Court are unanimously of opinion against the prisoner.\nAs to the second exception, the Judges were divided in opinion: Haix, Lowrie and HexdersoN being of opinion that the exception was fatal to the indictment, and that sentence of death could not be pronounced against the prisoner upon the indictment, in consequence thereof; Tayeor and Looice, being of a contrary opinion.\nIIendersoN, Judge,\nobserved, that if the Court, were\nnow about to decide on the propriety of requiring the dimensions of any wound charged in an indictment to'be mortal, to be set out, he should be clearly of opinion that it was unnecessary. But as immemorial custom, and all the authorities have determined, though not for reasons satisfactory to his mind, that wherever a death is stated to be occasioned by a wound, that the length, breadth and deptli of the wound should be described, whore they are capable of description ; and as the word wounds is used in this indictment, the dimensions of those wounds ought to have been stated. The Judge observed, that a precedent had bqen produced from West\u2019s Symbolcogravlmj, which did not seem to make this necessary : but this was not an authority; it was a mere precedent, upon which no judgment had passed, and the omission might have been made by mistake. On examining all the books, he could find no authority where a death is charged in an indictment to be produced by a wound, that the dimensions of the wound are omitted. It is not for the Court, to determine why this description is required ; it is enough for them to know, that the law does require it $ and believing, both from authority and precedent that this was the law*' he felt it to be his duty so to pronounce it.\nLowrie, Judge,\nhad but little doubt, if this indictment were submitted to the opinion of men unlearned in the law, it would be their unanimous opinion that the description of the manner in which the deceased came to his death was sufficiently set forth. But if the law has said otherwise, though the Court may not see the reason upon which the law is founded, they must be bound by it. It appears from the books, that wounds capable of description, must be described, that the Court may judge whether it be probable, that death might have been produced by them. It appears probable, that in this case, Conway might have come to his death by the strokes stated to have been given; but the dimensions of the wounds being required, they canriot be.dispensed with. The authorities to this point stand uncontradicted, except by West in his precedents, which, for the reasons stated by his brother Hexdersox, ought not to set aside the others. All the exceptions to this rule, are cases where the wound cannot be described, such as where a limb is cut off, or the body run through. He thought the exception was fatal to the indictment.\nHaix, Judge,\nsaid, it was unnecessary for him to add much to what had been said by his brethren, IIej\u00edder-son and Lowrie. But it might be asked what the Common Law of England was, when it was adopted by this country ? for such as it was, it must be observed. It had been very properly remarked, that if the Court were now met to determine in what manner indictments of this kind should be formed, this strictness would not be required. Any one proposing that wounds should be described as laid down in the books, would be considered as evincing but little knowledge of legislation. The rea son given by writers for observing this particularity is, that the Court may see that the wound is such as might produce death. The causes of the death appeared to be laid with sufficient certainty in this indictment: but as we find, from all the authorities, from Coke to East, that whenever death is stated to be produced by a wound, the dimensions of the wound must be given, it cannot now be dispensed with. It appears from West, that the law was not formerly so: but this was the law when the Common Law of England was introduced here. All modern writers agree that the dimensions of the wound must be stated,* not for any good reason, he admitted j but it was not for the Court to legislate, but to decide, as they had sworn to do, according to the law. The exceptions stated in the books, prove the rule. When bruises or blows are stated, no dimensions are necessary j but where a wound is laid, it has been an invariable custom to state its dimensions.\nTayi,o:r, Judge,\nsaid, he was sorry that it was not in his power to concur in the opinion delivered by his brethren. He, however, could place but little confidence in his own opinion, since it was different to-day, from what it was yesterday. He then thought the indictment could not be sustained : but upon a more careful examination of authorities, he now thought otherwise. He had looked into West\u2019s Book of Precedents \u2022, and though, as had been stated, precedents only shew the opinions of the writers, yet all precedents which are brought into argument are of the same authority. Their weight depends much upon the age in which they were written, and the character of the writers. Such as they are, they had induced him to change his opinion. (He here read from West the indictment produced by the prisoner\u2019s counsel.) Looking further into the book, he found a precedent, where a person is charged with striking with a club t lie is stated to have struck, wounded, and maltreated the deceased, who languished and died, but there is no des- ciiption of the wound. He found another precedent, where a person is charged with striking, wounding, and. maltreating the deceased, without describing the wound. From these precedents it appeared, that the writer did not consider it necessary, when a wound was inflicted with a club or stick, that it. should be particularly described. These precedents had induced him to look into the English Common Law, by which his opinion was confirmed.\nHe said he had read what East*says on the subject, where he states that in all cases of doubt, a statement which shews that death might ensue, is sufficient,\u2022 and had asked himself, whether the wound given to Conway is so described in the indictment, as probably to occasion death ? The answer was in the affirmative.\nThis indictment, he observed, is in the same words with the precedents in West, except as to the word Si maltreated,\u201d which is found in the latter, and which is of no consequence.\nFinally, he said, lie came to this conclusion, that wherever the death was occasioned by a cut with a sword, dagger, or other edged instrument, it is necessary to state the dimensions of the wound : but when the death is occasioned by a club, cudgel, or stick, it is sufficient to state the wound, without the dimensions. He, therefore, was of opinion, that the exception to the indictment could not be sustained.\nLocke, Judge,\nagreed entirely with the opinion delivered by bis brother Tayiok, for the same reasons, and from the same authorities quoted by him, and which he deemed it unnecessary to repeat.\nThe indictment being adjudged insufficient, by a majority of the Court, the prisoner was remanded to jail to answer the same charge upon another bill of indictment to be preferred against him.\n5 Co.

Evidence\u2014doctor testimony not admitted\u2014medical diagnosis or treatment exception inapplicable\nThe trial court did not err in a first-degree murder case by denying defendant\u2019s motion to admit the testimony of a doctor stating that defendant confessed to the killing only because one of the interviewing officers told him that he would receive the death penalty if he did not confess. Defendant saw the doctor for the purpose of preparing a defense, and the statement defendant sought to admit was not shown to be pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment.\n2. Constitutional Law\u2014right to confront witnesses\u2014private conversations with attorneys\u2014attorney-client privilege\nThe trial court did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him in a first-degree murder case by refusing to permit defense counsel to cross-examine two coparticipants regarding conversations they had with their attorneys. The coparticipants\u2019 private conversations with their attorneys were protected by the attorney-client privilege. Further, defendant was permitted to inform the jury that the copartici-pants were testifying under an agreement with the State and were provided a charge concession.\n3. Sentencing\u2014life imprisonment without parole\u2014not cruel and unusual punishment\nAlthough defendant contended that the trial court erred in a first-degree murder case by sentencing defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole since it allegedly violated the 8th Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the Court of Appeals has previously rejected defendant\u2019s argument.\n4. Jury\u2014refusal to remove jury foreperson\u2014failure to renew challenge during trial\nThe trial court did not err in a first-degree murder case by refusing to remove the jury foreperson from the jury. Defense counsel failed to renew his challenge as required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1214(h)(2) since he did not attempt to renew the challenge until after the jury returned its verdict. Removal for cause must be requested during the trial.\n5. Evidence\u2014curtailing cross-examination\u2014precluding doctor\u2019s testimony\nThe trial court did not err in a first-degree murder case by curtailing defendant\u2019s cross-examination of witnesses about privileged attorney-client conversations and precluding a doctor\u2019s testimony since defendant saw the doctor in preparation of his defense.\nAppeal by defendant from judgment entered 9 February 2011 by Judge Claire Hill in Robeson County Superior Court.

Trippe, for the State.\nWilliam H. Dowdy for defendant-appellant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "HUNTER, Robert C., Judge.\nDefendant Jamie Daquan Lowery appeals from a judgment entered 9 February 2011 after a jury found him guilty of first degree murder pursuant to the felony murder rule. Defendant argues on appeal that: (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to admit the testimony of Brad Fisher, Ph.D.; (2) that his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was violated when the trial court refused to permit defense counsel to cross examine witnesses regarding conversations they had with their attorneys; (3) the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole constituted cruel and unusual punishment; (4) the trial court erred in denying his motion to remove the jury foreperson; and (5) the trial court denied his right to present a full and complete defense. After careful review, we find no error.\nBackground\nOn 2 July 2008, Alfred Parnell was shot twice and killed while seated in his truck, which was located near a dumpster area behind a grocery store in Robeson County, North Carolina. It is undisputed that on 2 July 2008, defendant, Joshua Goodson, and Nicholas Blackmon drove to the same dumpster area behind the grocery store where Parnell was parked. Both Goodson and Blackmon were questioned by police in July 2008 and denied any knowledge regarding Parnell\u2019s death. However, the two men later cooperated with the investigation and testified against defendant at trial. Goodson and Blackmon admitted before the jury that they had each received a \u201ccharge concession,\u201d and, according to its terms, had not been charged in connection with Parnell\u2019s death. They further testified that they did not know that they would receive a charge concession when they agreed to cooperate with the investigation.\nGoodson testified that defendant and Blackmon were passengers in his car on 2 July 2008. He stated that he pulled up to the dumpster area behind the grocery store and placed some bags in a dumpster. He then pulled into the parking lot of the grocery store and went inside. As he was going inside, he saw defendant get out of the car and walk back to the dumpster area. When Goodson returned to the car, he saw defendant \u201cjogging\u201d back to the car \u201cfrom the road.\u201d Defendant then made the statement: \u201c \u2018[M]an, I be trippin.\u2019 \u201d However, defendant did not make any incriminating statements related to Parnell\u2019s death. Goodson claimed that he did not see defendant with a weapon that day and that he was unaware that Parnell had been shot until he was later informed by his brother, a Lumberton police officer.\nBlackmon testified that after Goodson parked the car at the grocery store, defendant exited the car and stated: \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to get his ass.\u2019 \u201d When defendant returned to the car, he said that he shot Parnell because \u201c \u2018he wouldn\u2019t give it up.\u2019 \u201d Blackmon also testified that he did not see defendant with a weapon that day.\nDefendant was arrested on 5 August 2008. He was 16 years old at the time. In his initial interview with the police, he denied killing Parnell; however he later confessed to the shooting. On 9 February 2011, a jiiry convicted defendant of first degree murder pursuant to the felony murder rule, the underlying felony being robbery with a dangerous weapon. The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defendant timely appealed to this Court.\nDiscussion\nI.\nFirst, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to admit the testimony of Dr. Fisher. Defendant claims that Dr. Fisher would have testified that defendant told Dr. Fisher that he confessed to the killing only because one of the interviewing officers told him that he would receive the death penalty if he did not confess. Defendant claims that while his statement to Dr. Fisher constituted hearsay, it was admissible pursuant to Rule 803(4) of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence. Defendant\u2019s argument is without merit.\nA trial court\u2019s determination concerning the extent to which an out-of-court statement constitutes inadmissible hearsay is subject to de novo review. State v. Miller, 197 N.C. App. 78, 87-88, 676 S.E.2d 546, 552, disc. review denied, 363 N.C. 586, 683 S.E.2d 216 (2009). Rule 803(4), the medical-diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule, states:\nStatements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803(4) (2009). Consequently, statements made for the purpose of obtaining medical diagnosis or treatment do not constitute inadmissible hearsay. Id.\nIn evaluating whether a statement is admissible pursuant to Rule 803(4), the trial court must determine that (1) \u201cthe declarant intended to make the statements at issue in order to obtain medical diagnosis or treatment\u201d and that (2) \u201cthe declarant\u2019s statements were reasonably pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment.\u201d State v. Hinnant, 351 N.C. 277, 289, 523 S.E.2d 663, 670-71 (2000), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 982, 161 L. Ed. 2d 737 (2005). In making such a determination, the trial court must consider \u201call objective circumstances of record surrounding declarant\u2019s statement[.]\u201d Id. at 287-89, 523 S.E.2d at 670.\nHere, it is evident that defendant was not seeking a diagnosis of his condition for the purpose of obtaining treatment. \u201cRather, the record clearly shows that the defendant\u2019s statements . . . were made for the purpose of preparing and presenting a defense to the crimes for which he stood accused.\u201d State v. Jones, 339 N.C. 114, 145, 451 S.E.2d 826, 842 (1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1169, 132 L. Ed. 2d 873 (1995). At oral arguments in this case, defendant\u2019s appellate coun sel admitted that defendant saw Dr. Fisher with the hope that any mental illness he may have had could be diagnosed and used as a defense to the crimes charged. Even though defendant may have wanted continued treatment if he did, in fact, have a mental illness, his primary objective was to present the diagnosis as a defense.\nAs stated in Jones, \u201c[a] person\u2019s motivation to speak truthfully is much greater when he seeks diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition than when he seeks diagnosis in order to prepare a defense to criminal charges.\u201d Id. Defendant\u2019s motivation in this case was to prepare a defense to the crimes charged; therefore, the statements \u201clacked the indicia of reliability based on the self-interest inherent in obtaining appropriate medical treatment.\u201d State v. Stafford, 317 N.C. 568, 574, 346 S.E.2d 463, 467 (1986). Consequently, we hold that defendant did not satisfy the first prong of the test set out in Hinnant.\nAs for the second prong of the Hinnant test, defendant has made no argument as to how his statement that he only confessed because an officer told him he would receive the death penalty if he did not confess was \u201creasonably pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment.\u201d Hinnant, 351 N.C. at 289, 523 S.E.2d at 671. Defendant does not contend that his statement had anything to do with a mental illness he may have had at the time. See State v. Gattis, 166 N.C. App. 1, 8-9, 601 S.E.2d 205, 210 (2004) (holding that exculpatory statement made by defendant to a nurse and recorded in the nurse\u2019s notes was not admissible under Rule 803(4) because it was not reasonably pertinent to diagnosis and treatment).\nIt is relevant to acknowledge that defendant never sought to suppress his confession. Rather, defendant sought to admit a statement that would have cast doubt on the veracity of his confession without his having to take the stand or challenge the validity of the confession in any way. To hold that this statement was admissible, without any greater showing, would set a harmful precedent that would allow a defendant to improperly introduce exculpatory statements to the jury under the auspices of Rule 803(4). A defendant would only have to make the exculpatory statement to a medical professional and then claim that he saw the medical professional for the purposes of diagnosis or treatment. Clearly, defendant seeks to expand Rule 803(4) far beyond what was intended by the legislature or what is allowed by our caselaw.\nIn sum, because defendant saw Dr. Fisher for the purpose of preparing a defense, and the statement defendant sought to admit was not shown to be pertinent to a medical diagnosis or treatment, we hold that defendant\u2019s statement to Dr. Fisher was not admissible under Rule 803(4). Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to admit Dr. Fisher\u2019s testimony.\nII.\nNext, defendant argues that his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was violated when the trial court refused to permit defense counsel to cross examine Blackmon and Goodson regarding conversations they had with their attorneys in July 2008. Specifically, defendant sought to inquire as to conversations concerning the State\u2019s charge concession should Blackmon and Goodson testify against defendant. Defendant claims that, contrary to their trial testimony, these two witnesses knew that the State was offering a charge concession when they agreed to testify.\nThis Court reviews de novo whether the right to confrontation was violated. State v. Hurt, _ N.C. App. _, _, 702 S.E.2d 82, 87 (2010). The Confrontation Clause, applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, protects the fundamental right of an accused \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. \u201cIt aims to ensure the evidence is reliable \u2018by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d State v. Jackson, _ N.C. App. _, _, 717 S.E.2d 35, 38 (2011) (quoting Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 845, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666, 678 (1990)). \u201cThe elements of confrontation include the witness\u2019s: physical presence; under-oath testimony; cross-examination; and exposure of his demeanor to the jury.\u201d Id. \u201cConfrontation means more than being allowed to confront the witness physically. Our cases construing the confrontation clause hold that a primary interest secured by it is the right of cross-examination.\u201d Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 315, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347, 353 (1974) (citation, quotation marks omitted, and alteration omitted).\nHere, defendant sought to question the witnesses about conversations they had with their attorneys, and defendant claims that his confrontation rights were violated because he was not permitted to do so. We hold that Goodson\u2019s and Blackmon\u2019s private conversations with their attorneys were protected by the attorney-client privilege and the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to seek information protected by this privilege.\nIt is well established that:\nA privilege exists if (1) the relation of attorney and client existed at the time the communication was made, (2) the communication was made in confidence, (3) the communication relates to a matter about which the attorney is being professionally consulted, (4) the communication was made in the course of giving or seeking legal advice for a proper purpose although litigation need not be contemplated and (5) the client has not waived the privilege.\nState v. Murvin, 304 N.C. 523, 531, 284 S.E.2d 289, 294 (1981). Defendant does not explicitly argue that the communications between the witnesses and their attorneys do not meet this test. Rather, defendant claims that Blackmon and Goodson had no 6th Amendment right to counsel when they met with detectives in July 2008, and, therefore, their communications with their attorneys were not privileged. Defendant confuses the issue. Goodson and Blackmon had not been arrested when they were questioned by police. The two men sought advice of counsel and their respective counsel had discussions with the State that resulted in Goodson and Blackmon agreeing to testify against defendant. As a result, they were never charged with a crime in connection with the killing. Therefore, the issue is not whether Blackmon and Goodson availed themselves of their 6th Amendment right to counsel; rather, the issue is whether the attorney-client privilege prohibited defense counsel from inquiring about the men\u2019s private conversations with their attorneys. As stated supra, the privilege applies in this instance.\nStill, defendant claims that Blackmon and Goodson waived any privileges they may have had when they took the stand to testily. Again defendant confuses the issue, citing cases that pertain to a waiver of a defendant\u2019s 5th Amendment rights when he or she takes the stand to testify. Here, Blackmon and Goodson agreed to testify regarding the events surrounding the death of Mr. Parnell. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1054 (2009), defendant was made aware of the charge concessions and was permitted to inquire about them in order to reveal any ulterior motivation on the part of Goodson and Blackmon. However, the private communications that occurred between the two men and their attorneys regarding their respective agreements with the State were not admissible and the attorney-client privilege was not waived when they took the stand to testify in accordance with their agreements.\nDefendant briefly argues that any privileges Blackmon and Goodson may have had should \u201cgive way\u201d because such privileges were \u201cin derogation of the search for truth.\u201d Defendant cites Davis, 415 U.S. at 319, 39 L. Ed. 2d at 355, where the United States Supreme Court held that the defendant was denied his Confrontation Clause rights when the trial court refused to allow him to question a witness about his prior adjudication of juvenile delinquency, which was inadmissible under state law, and his probation status. Defendant argues that, like the defendant in Davis, he should have been permitted to ask the witnesses about matters that are generally inadmissible to reveal the witnesses\u2019 \u201cbias and prejudice.\u201d Id. at 311, 39 L. Ed. 2d at 351. This case is inapposite. In Davis, the Court held that \u201cthe State\u2019s desire that [the witness] fulfill his public duty to testify free from embarrassment and with his reputation unblemished must fall before the right of petitioner to seek out the truth in the process of defending himself.\u201d Id. at 320, 39 L. Ed. 2d at 356. In the present case, defendant asks this Court to vitiate the attorney-client privilege, not merely the right to testify without embarrassment.\nDespite defendant\u2019s claim that the attorney-client privilege should \u201cgive way,\u201d to a criminal defendant\u2019s right to question a witness about private conversations with his or her attorney, our Supreme Court has recognized the vital importance of the privilege, stating:\nThe attorney-client privilege is unique among all privileged communications. In practice, communications between attorney and client can encompass all subjects which may be discussed in any other privileged relationship and indeed all subjects within the human experience. As such, it is the privilege most beneficial to the public, both in facilitating competent legal advice and ultimately in furthering the ends of justice.\nIn re Miller, 357 N.C. 316, 333, 584 S.E.2d 772, 785 (2003). Defendant has not presented any caselaw that would suggest that the attorney-client privilege should be nullified so that a defendant can question a witness about confidential conversations for the purpose of impeachment. Granted, defendant was unable to prove his theory that the witnesses were aware of the charge concessions offered by the State when they agreed to testify; however, defendant was permitted to inform the jury that Goodson and Blackmon were testifying pursuant to an agreement with the State and were provided a charge concession. It is unlikely that any questioning regarding conversations between the two men and their attorneys would have produced any additional information that would have aided the jury in the \u201csearch for truth.\u201d\nFinally, defendant claims that the North Carolina Code of Professional Responsibility\u2019s requirement of candor to the tribunal \u201coutweighed Goodson\u2019s and Blackmon\u2019s attorneys\u2019 obligation to assist them[.]\u201d This argument is irrelevant to the matter at hand. Defendant has not cited any authority that would require Goodson\u2019s and Blackmon\u2019s attorneys to come forth during the trial and inform the trial court that the witnesses did, in fact, know that the State was offering them a charge concession when they agreed to testify.\nIn sum, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to question the witnesses about their conversations with their attorneys during charge concession negotiations. These conversations were protected by the attorney-client privilege. Moreover, defendant was allowed to inquire before the jury regarding the agreements ultimately reached with the State. The witnesses\u2019 potential bias and/or ulterior motives for testifying were made known to the jury. Consequently, assuming, arguendo, that defendant should have been permitted to engage in this line of questioning, we hold that any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Bishop, 346 N.C. 365, 385, 488 S.E.2d 769, 779 (1997) (\u201cHowever, even when a defendant objects, this constitutional error will not merit a new trial where the State shows that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).\nIII.\nNext, defendant argues that the trial court erred in sentencing him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole because the sentence violated the 8th Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. This Court has rejected defendant\u2019s argument in State v. Lee, 148 N.C. App. 518, 525, 558 S.E.2d 883, 888, appeal dismissed, 355 N.C. 498, 564 S.E.2d 228, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 955, 154 L. Ed. 2d 305 (2002). The Court stated that the \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s punishment is severe but it is not cruel or unusual in the constitutional sense.\u201d Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted). This panel is bound by the holding in Lee.\nDefendant cites Graham v. Florida, _ U.S. _, _, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825, 850 (2010), where the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life without parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide.\u201d This holding is not controlling in the case sub judice because defendant was convicted of committing a homicide.\nIV.\nDefendant claims that the trial court erred in refusing to remove the jury foreperson from the jury. During jury selection, defendant had exhausted his peremptory challenges, but asked the trial court to \u201cstrike\u201d Tonya Howell for cause. The transcript of the jury voir dire is not available, but according to defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s affidavit, Ms. Howell stated that she knew the Robeson County District Attorney, Johnson Britt. She revealed, inter alia, that Mr. Britt was her son\u2019s soccer coach, that she had spoken with him on over 20 occasions, and that she was pleased with the way Mr. Britt had handled various criminal cases involving her son. The trial court denied defense counsel\u2019s request to strike Ms. Howell for cause. Ms. Howell subsequently served as the jury foreperson. After the jury returned its verdict, defendant renewed his challenge.\nThe decision \u201c \u2018[w]hether to allow a challenge for cause in jury selection is ... ordinarily left to the sound discretion of the trial court which will not be reversed on appeal except for abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d State v. Stephens, 347 N.C. 352, 365, 493 S.E.2d 435, 443 (1997) (quoting State v. Locklear, 331 N.C. 239, 247, 415 S.E.2d 726, 731 (1992)), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 831, 142 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1998).\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1214(h) (2009) sets forth the requirements for preservation of the trial court\u2019s denial of a request to strike a juror for cause, stating:\n(h) In order for a defendant to seek reversal of the case on appeal on the ground that the judge refused to allow a challenge made for cause, he must have:\n(1) Exhausted the peremptory challenges available to him;\n(2) Renewed his challenge as provided in subsection (i) of this section; and\n(3) Had his renewal motion denied as to the juror in question.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1214(i) states:\n(i) A party who has exhausted his peremptory challenges may move orally or in writing to renew a challenge for cause previously denied if the party either:\n(1) Had peremptorily challenged the juror; or\n(2) States in the motion that he would have challenged that juror peremptorily had his challenges not been exhausted.\nThe judge may reconsider his denial of the challenge for cause, reconsidering facts and arguments previously adduced or taking cognizance of additional facts and arguments presented. If upon reconsideration the judge determines that the juror should have been excused for cause, he must allow the party an additional peremptory challenge.\nIt appears from the record that defense counsel in this case failed to renew his challenge as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1214(h)(2). Defendant did not attempt to renew the challenge until after the jury returned its verdict. Clearly, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1214(h)-(i) contemplates removal for cause during the trial. Defendant has, therefore, waived this argument on appeal. See State v.

Also, because the trial court\u2019s order prohibiting defendant from transferring, disposing, or removing property in which he had an interest was authorized under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-358, we affirm the trial court\u2019s 17 February 2011 supplemental order.\nOn 26 January 2010, a Civil Superior Court in Mecklenburg County entered judgment in the matter between plaintiff Songwooyarn Trading Company, defendants Sox Eleven, Inc. and Ung Ahn, and third-party defendant Jae Song. The claims before the court included breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair or deceptive practices. The trial court ordered that plaintiff \u201cshall have and recover the principal amount of $164,318.32 from defendant Sox Eleven, Inc.\u201d and $1,022,041.00 from defendant Ahn.\nDefendant Ahn timely appealed the trial court\u2019s order to this Court. However, defendant Ahn acknowledges that he \u201cdid not obtain a stay of execution of the judgment in the matter [pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-289] and as a result, the plaintiff was afforded the right to pursue execution of assets . . . .\u201d On 21 June 2011, in Songwooyarn Trading Co., Ltd. v. Sox Eleven, Inc., _ N.C. App. _, 714 S.E.2d 162 (2011) (Songwooyarn Trading I), this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, and our North Carolina Supreme Court denied defendant Ahn\u2019s petition for discretionary review on 9 November 2011. Songwooyarn Trading Co., Ltd. v. Sox Eleven, Inc., 2011 N.C. LEXIS 929 (N.C. No. 30P11) (9 November 2011).\nOn 5 April 2010, prior to this Court rendering an opinion in Songwooyarn Trading I, defendant Ahn filed a Motion to Claim Exempt Property (Statutory Exemptions) in the trial court seeking to set aside as exempt from judgment certain real property located in Los Angeles, as well as personal property. Plaintiff contested the motion, specifically contending that the motion failed to set out a complete listing of the debtor\u2019s non-exempt assets, impermissibly undervalued the debtor\u2019s property, and attempted to claim exemptions beyond those permitted by North Carolina law. Following a hearing on the matter, the trial court, on 18 June 2010, found that defendant Ahn had failed to adhere to the statutory requirements for claiming exempt property but allowed defendant an opportunity to re-file the motion.\nOn 2 July 2010, defendant Ahn re-filed the motion to claim exempt property. Plaintiff filed an Objection to Second Motion to Claim Exempt Property, again contending that defendant Ahn\u2019s motion failed to provide a complete listing of defendant\u2019s non-exempt assets and where values were provided, the property was undervalued.\nOn 4 October 2010, defendant Ahn filed responses to plaintiff\u2019s previously submitted interrogatories to discover assets and request for production of documents. On 3 November 2010, plaintiff subpoenaed documents relating to defendants Sox Eleven, Inc., and Ahn from: Bank of America, N.A.; Weekender for Active Lifestyles, Inc.; American Express Company; and RBC Bank. Plaintiff also subpoenaed documents from Bank of America N.A. related to Young Sin Ahn, defendant Ahn\u2019s wife. On 10 November 2010, defendant Ahn filed a motion to quash and modify in supplemental proceedings to quash the subpoenas issued to Bank of America, N.A., Weekender Active Lifestyles, Inc., and American Express Company. Defendant Ahn further moved to modify the subpoena issued with regard to accounts held by his wife, Young Ahn. On 12 November 2010, defendant filed Amended Responses to Interrogatories to Discover Assets Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-352.1 and Request for Production of Documents Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-352.1.\nOn 22 December 2010, plaintiff filed a motion for supplemental relief,\n[requesting an order] prohibiting the Defendant and Judgment Debtor Ung Chul Ahn (\u201cDebtor\u201d) from transferring or otherwise disposing of his assets, including certain rental proceeds arising from real property, or other sources, and requiring Debtor and Young Ahn to deposit one-half of all rental income or other proceeds derived from such property with the Clerk of Court.\nThe same day, plaintiff filed a motion to compel subpoena responses and a motion to compel responses to post-judgment discovery.\nThe matter came on for hearing on 15 February 2011. On 17 February 2011, the trial court entered an order prohibiting defendant Ahn from transferring, disposing, or removing property or assets within North Carolina unless the property is declared as exempt on defendant Ahn\u2019s 2 July 2010 motion to claim exempt property. Further, the trial court ordered that Bank of America, Weekender for Active Lifestyles, Inc., American Express Company, and RBC Bank shall comply with the subpoenas issued to produce documents related to defendants Sox Eleven, Inc., and Ahn. The trial court further specified that the order encompassed requests for documents related to accounts held jointly between defendant Ahn and his wife, Young Ahn, but the order did not reach accounts held by Young Ahn individually. Defendant Ahn appeals.\nOn appeal, defendant raises the following two issues: Whether the trial court (I) lacked jurisdiction to conduct a hearing and issue an order in supplemental proceedings; and (II) erred in its order restricting the transfer, removal or disposal of assets.\nI\nDefendant first contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to conduct a supplemental hearing and issue an order when the principal matter was on appeal. Defendant argues that the supplemental proceedings addressing plaintiffs motions to obtain defendant\u2019s bank records, to limit defendant\u2019s statutory exemptions, and to freeze all assets in which defendant had an interest was held while the principal matter was pending appeal, and, therefore, the trial court was functus officio, without jurisdiction to enforce its order. We disagree.\nUnder North Carolina General Statutes, section 1-294, \u201c[w]hen an appeal is perfected as provided by this Article it stays all further proceedings in the court below upon the judgment appealed from, or upon the matter embraced therein; but the court below may proceed upon any other matter included in the action and not affected by the judgment appealed from.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-294 (2011).\n[W]hile it is true the general rule is that once an appeal is perfected, the lower court is divested of jurisdiction, Wiggins v. Bunch, 280 N.C. 106, 184 S.E.2d 879 (1971), the lower court nonetheless retains jurisdiction to take action which aids the appeal, id. at 111, 184 S.E.2d at 881, and to hear motions and grant orders, so long as they do not concern the subject matter of the suit and are not affected by the judgment appealed from. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1-294 (1983) ....\nFaulkenbury v. Teachers\u2019 & State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, 108 N.C.

Ross, 194 N.C. App. 365, 368, 669 S.E.2d 828, 831 (2008) (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 62(c) (2007)).\nDefendant Ahn appealed from the 26 January 2010 judgment against him on claims of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair or deceptive practices. Following defendant Ahn\u2019s motions to exempt property from the reach of judgment creditors through statutory safe harbors and plaintiff\u2019s attempts to compel discovery from Ahn and the production of documents related to defendants Sox Eleven, Inc., and Ahn via subpoena, the trial court held a supplemental hearing on 15 February 2011. On 17 February 2011, the trial court entered an order prohibiting defendant Ahn from transferring, disposing, or removing property or assets within North Carolina unless the property w\u00e1s declared exempt on defendant Ahn\u2019s 2 July 2010 motion to claim exempt property. Further, the trial court ordered that the entities subpoenaed for production of documents related to defendants Sox Eleven, Inc. and Ahn shall comply with the subpoenas.\nOn 21 June 2011, this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s 26 January 2010 judgment, Songwooyarn Trading I, and, on 9 November 2011, our Supreme Court denied defendant Ahn\u2019s petition for discretionary review. Songwooyarn Trading Co., 2011 N.C. LEXIS 929 (N.C. No. 30P11) (9 November 2011).\nThe trial court\u2019s 17 February 2011 supplemental order, entered during the pendency of the appeal of the 26 January 2010 trial court order while jurisdiction was vested in the appellate courts, did not concern the subject matter of the suit and was intended to aid in the security of plaintiff\u2019s rights while the appeal was pending. We hold the trial court retained jurisdiction to enter a supplemental order. Faulkenbury, 108 N.C. App. at 364, 424 S.E.2d at 422; Ross, 194 N.C. App. at 368, 669 S.E.2d at 831. Accordingly, defendant Ahn\u2019s argument is overruled.\nII\nDefendant Ahn argues that the trial court erred by enjoining him from transferring, removing, or disposing of assets. Defendant first contends that the trial court\u2019s supplemental order is too broad in that it restricts transactions regarding all property in which defendant has an interest, including property held as tenancy by the entirety, and is too limiting in that it restricts defendant Ahn\u2019s exemptions to those declared in the 2 July 2010 motion to claim exemptions. We disagree.\nIn support of his argument defendant Ahn cites North Carolina General Statutes, section 1-315(a)(1), \u201c[t]he following property of the judgment debtor, not exempted from sale under the Constitution and laws of this State, may be levied on and sold under execution . . . Goods, chattels, and real property belonging to him.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-315(a)(1) (2011). However, here, the trial court\u2019s order does not compel the sale of any property but, rather, prohibits the transfer, disposal, or removal of property or assets within North Carolina by defendant Ahn unless the property is declared exempt in defendant Ahn\u2019s 2 July 2010 motion to claim exempt property.\nUnder North Carolina General Statutes, section 1-358, \u201c[t]he court or judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of, or any interference with, the property of the judgment debtor not exempt from execution.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-358 (2011). We hold that the trial court\u2019s prohibition on defendant Ahn\u2019s transfer, disposal, or removal of property or assets is squarely within the authority conferred by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-358.\nAs for defendant Ahn\u2019s contention that the trial court order is too restrictive in that it recognizes as exempt only that property which was claimed in defendant Ahn\u2019s 2 July 2010 motion to claim exemptions, we note that the order does not prohibit defendant Ahn from filing an amended motion or subsequent motion to claim statutory exemptions. Accordingly, defendant Ahn\u2019s arguments are overruled.\nAffirmed.\nJudges CALABRIA and STROUD concur.", "author": "BRYANT, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["SONGWOOYARN TRADING COMPANY, LTD., Plaintiff v.

McConkey, and Jana Berg, Esq., for Brunswick County.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STEPHENS, Judge.\nFactual Background and Procedural History\nThis appeal arises from a dispute over adjustments to the 2007 tax revaluations of certain residential lots in Brunswick County (\u201cthe County\u201d). For many years, the County has used the sales prices of comparable residential lots to set tax value base rates. Prior to 2005, few residential lots in the County were sold without infrastructure such as roads and water and sewer lines in place. Because so few lots were sold without infrastructure (which would presumably have lower values than more developed lots), the County developed the practice of discounting the tax value of such undeveloped lots. If a lot lacked any infrastructure, its value was generally assessed at 20% of that of an otherwise comparable developed lot. As infrastructure was added over time, the value would be stepped up to 40%, 60%, or 80% of sales values, depending on the degree of infrastructure completion. These discounting rates were reflected on tax record cards as a \u201ccondition factor\u201d expressed in decimal form.\nIn 2005 and 2006, sales practices began to change in the County, with more developers selling residential lots without infrastructure. On 6 May 2006, Taxpayer Ocean Isle Palms, LLC (\u201cOcean Isle\u201d) began selling lots in a large residential subdivision of approximately 400 lots divided into several phases. Between 6 May 2006 and 1 January 2007, Ocean Isle sold 180 lots in the subdivision at an average lot price of about $275,000, despite the lack of basic infrastructure in the subdivision.\nAs required by statute, the County conducted a general reappraisal in 2007. For this reappraisal, the County adopted a Schedule of Values which employed the same sales comparison method as in previous years, including the application of condition factors. As in past years, the 2007 Schedule of Values does not explicitly explain or limit how the \u201ccondition factor\u201d may be determined. In 2007, Ocean Isle lots were valued using the Schedule of Values, including the application of the condition factor, resulting in assessed values of $55,000 per lot (20%.of their $275,000 average sales price).\nIn late 2007 or early 2008, the County\u2019s tax assessor ordered his staff to stop using the condition factor to discount the value of undeveloped lots. At the assessor\u2019s direction, the valuations of Ocean Isle\u2019s undeveloped lots were recalculated in 2008 to remove the condition factor, resulting in a change of tax value from $55,000 in 2007 to $275,000 in 2008.\nUpon seeing the new valuations, Ocean Isle contacted the assessor\u2019s office and presented information about two items it contended should reduce the tax value of the lots. The sales prices of lots in the subdivision had included two years of prepaid bank interest paid from loan proceeds that Ocean Isle did not receive and $500 in attorney fees paid by Ocean Isle. In addition, Ocean Isle produced evidence that some of the lots contained wetlands or were otherwise not fully developable. Based on this information, the County reduced the 2008 assessments for Ocean Isle\u2019s lots by about 15% to $233,375 per lot. Undevelopable lots received further adjustments in valuation.\nThese values were carried forward in 2009 and 2010. Ocean Isle did not appeal from the adjusted revaluations in 2008 or 2009. However, Ocean Isle appealed the 2010 valuations to the County\u2019s Board of Equalization and Review (\u201cthe Board\u201d), which heard testimony and received evidence on 22 June 2010. The Board declined to change the valuation of Ocean Isle\u2019s lots. On 26 July 2010, Ocean Isle timely appealed to the North Carolina Property Tax Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) from the Board\u2019s decision. Before the Board and the Commission, Ocean Isle contended that the 2010 values were improper because the 2008 adjustments to the 2007 general revaluations had not been made for a statutorily-permitted reason. On 18 March 2011, Ocean Isle moved for summary judgment before the Commission. On 21 April 2011, the County moved for summary judgment. Following a 26 May 2011 hearing, the Commission, sitting as the State Board of Equalization and Review, entered an order granting Ocean Isle\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The order concluded that the 2008 adjustments had been unlawful and directed the County to use the 2007 revaluations for the 2010 tax year. The County appeals.\nDiscussion\nOn appeal, the County argues that the Commission erred (1) in granting summary judgment in favor of Ocean Isle because Ocean Isle negotiated reductions in its 2008 assessments and then chose not to appeal from those assessments, barring it from raising issues related to those assessments in its 2010 appeal and (2) in failing to find and conclude that the 2010 assessments were correctly carried forward from 2009 as required by statute. In the alternative, the County argues that summary judgment was improper because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the County\u2019s Schedule of Values was misapplied in 2007 and 2008. For the reasons discussed herein, we reverse and remand.\nStandard of Review\nNorth Carolina General Statute section 105-345.2\ngoverns the extent of review for appeals from the Property Tax Commission .... Subsection (a) provides that the appellate court shall review the record and exception and assignments of error in accordance with the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Subsection (b) provides that the appellate court shall (1) decide all relevant questions of law, (2) interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and (3) determine the meaning and applicability of the terms of any Commission action.\nIn re McElwee, 304 N.C. 68, 73-74, 283 S.E.2d 115, 119 (1981). We review questions of law de novo and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the Commission\u2019s decision under the whole-record test. In re The Greens of Pine Glen Ltd., 356 N.C. 642, 647, 576 S.E.2d 316, 319 (2003).\nHere, the County appeals from the Commission\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Ocean Isle. Rule 56(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that\n[s]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Furthermore, when considering a summary judgment motion, all inferences of fact... must be drawn against the movant and in favor of the party opposing the motion.\nCraig v. New Hanover Cty Bd. of Educ., 363 N.C. 334, 337, 678 S.E.2d 351, 353 (2009) (citations and quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[t]he North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to proceedings before the Commission[,]\u201d 17 N.C.A.C. 11.0209, and our review reveals no statutory or case law authority specifically permitting the Commission to rule on summary judgment. Nevertheless, this Court has recognized that\n[t]he duties of the Commission are quasi-judicial in nature and require the exercise of judgment and discretion. The Commission has the authority and responsibility to determine the weight and sufficiency of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, to draw inferences from the facts, and to appraise conflicting and circumstantial evidence.\nIn re Philip Morris U.S.A., 130 N.C. App. 529, 532, 503 S.E.2d 679, 681 (citations and quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 349 N.C. 359, 525 S.E.2d 456 (1998). In addition, we note that this Court has held in a pair of unpublished cases that the Commission does have such authority. See In re Brooks, _ N.C. App. _, 716 S.E.2d 441, 2011 N.C. App. LEXIS 2228 (2011); In re Richard, 184 N.C. App. 187, 645 S.E.2d 899, 2007 N.C. App. LEXIS 1335 (2007). The County\u2019s appeal raises questions of law,- to wit, issues of statutory interpretation and the propriety of summary judgment where there exist alleged issues of materi\u00e1l fact. Therefore, we review the Commission\u2019s summary judgment order de novo.\nPropriety of the 2008 Adjustments\nThe County first argues that the Commission erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ocean Isle because Ocean Isle negotiated reductions in its 2008 assessments and then chose not to appeal from those assessments, barring it from raising issues related to those assessments in its 2010 appeal. We disagree.\n\u201cSubchapter II of chapter 105 of our General Statutes, the \u2018Machinery Act\u2019 [], provides the statutory parameters for the listing and appraisal of property and the assessment and collection of property taxes by counties and municipalities.\u201d In re Allred, 351 N.C. 1, 4, 519 S.E.2d 52, 54 (1999). Counties of our State must conduct countywide revaluations of real property every eight years or sooner, depending on the county. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-286(a) (2011). In the years following a scheduled revaluation, counties are required to carry forward the revaluations unchanged, unless there exists a lawful basis for change pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-287(a) (2011). Taxpayers may seek review of valuations through their county boards of equalization and review. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-322(g)(2) (2011) (\u201cOn request, the board of equalization and review shall hear any taxpayer who owns or controls property taxable in the county with respect to the listing or appraisal of the taxpayer\u2019s property or the property of others.\u201d). Taxpayers can appeal the decisions of their county boards of equalization and review to the North Carolina Property Tax Commission, so long as they comply with the relevant time limitations and other requirements:\nGeneral Statute section 105-290 sets out the time limit for appeals from a board of equalization and review to the Property Tax Commission: Time Limits for Appeals.\u2014A notice of appeal. . . from a board of equalization and review shall be filed with the Property Tax Commission within 30 days after the date the board mailed a notice of its decision to the property owner. To perfect an appeal from the county board, an appellant must file a written notice of appeal with the clerk of the board of county commissioners and with the Property Tax Commission within 30 days after the county board has mailed notice of its decision pursuant to G.S. 105-322(g)(2)d.\nIn re La. Pac. Corp., _ N.C. App. _, _, 703 S.E.2d 190, 193 (2010) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\nWe begin by noting that no evidence in the record indicates that Ocean Isle \u201cnegotiated\u201d the reductions made to the 2008 valuations. Instead, the record reveals that Ocean Isle attended an \u201cinformal conference\u201d at the assessor\u2019s office in 2008 and was told that values would only be adjusted on lots if the assessor had incorrect sales price information. As a result, Ocean Isle provided information about the prepaid bank interest and attorney fees included in the sales prices, as well as about the undevelopable wetland lots. Based on that information, the County made adjustments. These adjustments are better characterized as unilateral action by the County based on the information provided by Ocean Isle rather than a \u201cnegotiation\u201d between the parties. In any event, we conclude that Ocean Isle\u2019s provision of this information had no effect on its right to appeal the 2010 tax values.\nWe also reject the County\u2019s contention that Ocean Isle\u2019s failure to appeal from the 2008 adjustments in that year or in 2009 somehow bars it from bringing an appeal to the valuations carried forward for tax year 2010. There is no dispute that Ocean Isle timely appealed the 2010 tax values to the Board or that it timely appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Commission. Further, Ocean Isle is not challenging its valuations from 2008 and 2009 or seeking a refund of the taxes paid based on those valuations. Instead, it timely challenges the 2010 assessments in the manner and within the time provided by statute. The County cites no case or statute, and we have likewise found none, which prevents a taxpayer from challenging a current year assessment on the basis of an erroneous or unlawful act which allegedly occurred in a prior tax year.\nWhile, as noted by both parties, the case involved a different procedural posture and predates the enactment of the Machinery Act in 1971, we find the following language from In re Pine Raleigh Corp. both instructive and persuasive:\nAppellee moved before the State Board to dismiss petitioner\u2019s appeal on the theory that not having sought review in 1960 [when the tax appraisal took place], it was concluded and could not seek a review in 1961. State Board denied the motion to dismiss. It proceeded to hear evidence on which it could act in determining the value of the property. We are of the opinion and hold that the State Board acted correctly in refusing to dismiss the appeal from the County Board for the reasons urged. Once real estate has been appraised for taxation, it continues to be listed at that figure until reappraised, unless some good reason warrants a change in value. Some specific conditions justifying a change in value are enumerated in G.S. 105-279. When that section is read and considered, as it must be, with G.S. 105-295, it is, we think, apparent that the Legislature intended to authorize County Board of Equalization and Review, when requested so to do, to correct any unjust and inequitable assessment. If it refuses to act, the taxpayer may appeal to the State Board of Assessment. The Legislature never contemplated, that an injustice done a taxpayer must continue for a period, of years merely because he failed at the first opportunity to bring the injustice to the attention of the authority having the power to correct.\n258 N.C. 398, 401, 128 S.E.2d 855, 857 (1963) (emphasis added). Thus, in In re Pine Raleigh Corp., as here, the taxpayer did not appeal the valuation in the year when it took place, but rather waited until that value had been carried forward to a subsequent tax year. Id. In response, the county board of equalization and review asserted that the taxpayer was barred from challenging the tax value that had been carried forward. Id. (summarizing the board\u2019s argument as the taxpayer \u201cnot having applied to the State Board in 1960 when the property was appraised, could not seek a reduction in 1961 based on past income, a fact known in 1960[.]\u201d). Although not binding, we agree with the reasoning of the Supreme Court and its assessment of the General Assembly\u2019s intent in providing for appeal to the State Board of Assessment, whose role is now occupied by the Property Tax Commission, of erroneous valuations even during non-revaluation years. Accordingly, we hold that Ocean Isle was entitled to raise issues relating back to the 2008 adjustments to the 2007 revaluations in support of its timely challenge to the 2010 assessments.\nThe flavor of the County\u2019s arguments is that Ocean Isle has \u201cgotten away with something\u201d by sitting on its rights to the detriment of the County. We note that Ocean Isle quite literally paid for its decision not to immediately challenge the 2008 assessments as adjusted, having paid taxes in 2008 and 2009 based on assessments which the Commission has now held were erroneous. The fact that sections 105-290 and 105-322 limit challenges to the current tax year will continue to serve as powerful encouragement for taxpayers to challenge any allegedly improper assessments as soon as possible. Further, as noted by Ocean Isle, the County\u2019s interpretation of the statutes would work a severe hardship on taxpayers who purchase property during non-revaluation years. A new property owner who discovered an error in the previous revaluation would have no opportunity to challenge it and would be saddled with the injustice until the next revaluation. We reject the County\u2019s interpretation.\nThe County\u2019s second argument is that the Commission erred in failing to find and conclude that the 2010 assessments were correctly carried forward from 2009 as required by statute. However, the Commission\u2019s findings of fact 16 and 17 state that the County adjusted the 2007 revaluations in 2008 and then carried the 2008 adjusted values forward in 2009 and 2010. In addition, conclusion of law 1 quotes the \u201ccarry-forward\u201d requirement of section 105-286(c).\nRather than a failure by the Commission to make certain findings and conclusions on this point, the County\u2019s true contention appears to be that, having been carried forward in accord with section 105-286, the improper valuations from 2008 are now proper and thus immune from challenge. We cannot agree. To adopt the County\u2019s argument would limit taxpayers\u2019 right to challenge revaluations to the year immediately following a revaluation because any wrongful revaluation carried forward would be transformed from unlawful to lawful. Nothing in section 105-287 or in our case law suggests that the carry forward provision is intended to immunize wrongful tax valuations from appeal or to convert them from wrongful to correct. As noted supra, the result would be that \u201can injustice done a taxpayer [would] continue for a period of years merely because [the taxpayer] failed at the first opportunity to bring the injustice to the attention of the authority having the power to correct.\u201d Id. at 401, 128 S.E.2d at 857. The County\u2019s argument is overruled.\nPropriety of Summary Judgment\nIn the alternative, the County argues that summary judgment was improper because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the County\u2019s 2007 Schedule of Values was misapplied. We agree.\nIn non-revaluation years (such as 2008 for the County), adjustments to valuations can be made only for one of the six reasons specified in section 105-287(a). Here, the County asserted that its 2008 adjustments to Ocean Isle\u2019s valuations were to \u201c[c]orrect an appraisal error resulting from a misapplication of the schedules, standards, and rules used in the county\u2019s most recent general reappraisal[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-287(a)(2).\nThere is no dispute that, in all respects pertinent to this appeal, the 2007 Schedule of Values is no different from earlier schedules of values used by the County in previous general reappraisals. The 2007 Schedule of Values still permitted appraisers to use the condition factor to discount the tax value of lots and to use their experience and expertise to determine the true value of lots. What did change in 2007 was the nature of the comparison sales to which the condition factor was applied\u2014before 2007, the comparison sales were largely of developed lots, while during the 2007 reappraisal, the comparison sales were of undeveloped lots. According to the County, the appraiser erred in applying the \u201ccondition factor\u201d to Ocean Isle\u2019s undeveloped lots in 2007 because the resulting tax values were not the true values of the lots. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-283 (2011) (\u201cAll property, real and personal, shall as far as practicable be appraised or valued at its true value in money. When used in this Subchapter, the words \u201ctrue value\u201d shall be interpreted as meaning market value ... ,\u201d).\nOur case law provides little explicit guidance in determining what constitutes \u201can appraisal error resulting from a misapplication of the schedules, standards, and rules[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-287(a)(2). However, our General Statutes are clear that property tax appraisals should reflect the property\u2019s true value. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-283; see also In re Bosley, 29 N.C. App. 468, 471-72, 224 S.E.2d 686, 688, disc. review denied, 290 N.C. 551, 226 S.E.2d 509 (1976) (noting that the purpose of section 105-283 is to \u201cprovide that all property shall be appraised at market value, and that all the various factors which enter into the market value of property are to be considered by the assessors in determining this market value for tax purposes\u201d). The requirement that real property be appraised at its true value is \u201cto assure, as far as practicable, a distribution of the burden of taxation in proportion to the true values of the respective taxpayers\u2019 property holdings . . . .\u201d In re King, 281 N.C. 533, 539, 189 S.E.2d 158, 161 (1972). This\n[e]quality of appraisal, with resulting equity in taxation, is fundamental in the Machinery Act. There may be reasonable variations from market value in appraisals of property for tax purposes if these variations are uniform. A uniform and dependable method of property appraisal which gives effect to the various factors that influence the market value of property and results in equitable taxation does not violate the appraisal provisions of the Machinery Act.\nIn re Bosley, 29 N.C. App. at 472, 224 S.E.2d at 688. The County\u2019s 2007 Schedule of Values echoed these principles in stating that the ultimate goal of its guidelines was to \u201censure the uniform, consistent, accurate and efficient valuation\u201d of property. We believe this language, along with that of the Machinery Act and case law quoted supra, must provide the context for all of the specific guidelines and rules in the 2007 Schedule of Values.\nThus, while we agree with Ocean Isle that the 2007 Schedule of Values provided no specific guidance about how the condition factor was to be applied, leaving that determination in the discretion of the appraiser, that discretion was not unbounded. Rather, the appraiser was required to use his experience and expertise to apply the condition factor in a way that \u201censure [d] the uniform, consistent, accurate and efficient valuation\u201d of property. If an appraiser instead applies a Schedule of Values in a manner which results in uneven, inconsistent, and inaccurate tax values, we hold that the appraiser has misapplied the schedule, causing an appraisal error which can, in turn, be corrected as provided for in section 105-287(a)(2).\nIn light of this holding, we believe the Commission erred in granting summary judgment because there were disputed issues of fact about whether the application of the condition factor in 2007 to undeveloped lots that had been sold resulted in uniform, consistent, and accurate assessments of the lots\u2019 true values. The parties presented conflicting evidence about whether the Ocean Isle lots were appraised at their true value in 2007. The county\u2019s appraiser stated that application of the condition factor resulted in accurate determinations of the lots\u2019 true values at $55,000, but the County presented the affidavit of a licensed appraiser placing the true values between $255,000 and $295,000. The Commission made no finding of fact about the true value of Ocean Isle\u2019s lots. While we recognize that \u201c[t]here may be reasonable variations from market value in appraisals of property for tax purposes[,]\u201d those variations must be \u201cuniform.\u201d In re Bosley, 29 N.C. App. at 472, 224 S.E.2d at 688. Here, the County presented evidence that application of the condition factor to undeveloped lots in 2007 varied between appraisers and subdivisions, suggesting an uneven and inconsistent, rather than uniform, valuation of property. Such a result would prevent the \u201cdistribution of the burden of taxation in proportion to the true values\u201d of taxpayer\u2019s property. In re King, 281 N.C. at 539, 189 S.E.2d at 161. Following a hearing, the Commission shall make the findings of fact necessary to resolve these disputed facts and such conclusions of law as result therefrom.\nTo be clear, we see nothing erroneous about the inclusion of the condition factor in the County\u2019s 2007 Schedule of Values nor in its grant of discretion to appraisers to use their experience and expertise to determine the true value of properties. We also emphasize that mere differences of opinion among appraisers about the exact true value of property are to be expected and do not constitute a misapplication of a county\u2019s schedule of values. However, the use of proce dures permitted by a schedule of values in a manner which results in lots being valued far below or far above their true values and in a manner inconsistent with the valuation of other lots in the same county is a misapplication of the schedule. Simply put, a county\u2019s schedules, rules, and standards for tax revaluations must be applied in a uniform and equitable manner that determines the true value of property.\nAccordingly, we reverse the Commission\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\nJudge STROUD concurs.\nJudge BEASLEY concurs in part and dissents in part.\n. The County conducted general reappraisals in 2007 and 2011.\n. At the time the assessment challenged by Ocean Isle became effective on 1 January 2008, the applicable statute was section 105-286(c). This section was repealed effective 1 July 2009 and replaced by section 105-287(a). This repeal and replacement shifted the effective language of section 105-286(c) to section 105-287(a), but made no substantive change to the relevant case law discussed herein.\n. The County\u2019s 2007 Schedule of Values quotes the language of section 105-283 as the basis for the County\u2019s appraisal standards.", "author": "STEPHENS, Judge.", "type": "majority"}, {"text": "BEASLEY, Judge,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\nWhile I agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of the first two issues, I write separately because I would also affirm the Commission\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Ocean Isle. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\nI do not believe there are any genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the County\u2019s 2007 Schedule of Values was misapplied. The record is clear that the County used the \u201ccondition factor\u201d method of appraisal for decades prior to this action, and that the decision of whether to apply a factor, and if so what factor, has always been in the sound discretion of the County\u2019s appraiser. The County appraiser applied this method in 2007 to value the Ocean Isle lots at prices ranging from $45,000 to $60,000 per parcel. The County then proffered an affidavit of another licensed appraiser, Ray Real, who contended that the lots are in fact worth around $200,000 more each. Real essentially asserted that the lots are worth between $255-295,000 before the condition factor was applied. Thus, the parties are not actually arguing about whether this was a misapplication of the County\u2019s Schedule of Values. Rather, they disagree as to whether the use of a condition factor was proper going forward.\nThe County did not dispute that the condition factor method had been employed for decades, so to argue now that it was a \u201cmisapplication\u201d of its Schedule of Values is unavailing. Instead, the County is actually arguing for a new standard appraisal practice to be imple mented. Because that is not a circumstance covered by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-287(a)(2) (2011), the Commission properly found that Ocean Isle was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and I would affirm that finding.", "author": "BEASLEY, Judge,", "type": "concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part"}], "parties": ["IN THE MATTER OF: APPEAL OF: OCEAN ISLE PALMS LLC FROM THE DECISION OF THE BRUNSWICK COUNTY BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND REVIEW CONCERNING THE VALUATION AND TAXATION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR TAX YEAR 2010"]}}}

Budd, for Defendant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STEPHENS, Judge.\nProcedural History and Factual Background\nThis case arises from a grievance filed with Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar (\u201cthe State Bar\u201d), concerning Defendant Sybil H. Barrett\u2019s participation as an attorney in a residential real estate closing in July 2007. On 30 October 2008, the State Bar received a grievance from the seller involved in the closing. The grievance alleged that Defendant had misrepresented the source of the buyer\u2019s down payment on a HUD-1 settlement statement at closing in order to prevent the lender from learning that the seller had loaned the buyer part of the down payment funds. The buyer and seller had entered into an agreement concerning repayment of the loan. However, the buyer had apparently not made payments expected by the seller, who expressed concerns about his ability to collect on the loan. In correspondence sent to Defendant before filing the grievance, the seller had claimed that this misrepresentation had made the buyer appear to be a better credit risk in the eyes of the lender, permitting the buyer to finance purchase of the residence to the seller\u2019s detriment.\nThe State Bar sent Defendant a notice of grievance, and Defendant responded by letter dated 6 March 2009, asserting that she had received approval of the HUD-1 statement from the lender, Chase Bank, and had not made any misrepresentations in connection with the closing. Defendant further asserted that the buyer and the seller had agreed to a five-year, no interest $7,400 loan of the down payment funds with a balloon payoff, but that the buyer had later (post-closing) told the seller he was planning to refinance the home in order to pay off the loan at an earlier date. Defendant suggested that the refinance had not occurred, angering the seller, who had filed the grievance out of a desire \u201cto punish everyone associated with the [closing].\u201d\nOn 13 April 2010, the State Bar filed a complaint with the Disciplinary Hearing Commission (\u201cthe DHC\u201d) alleging Defendant had knowingly misrepresented the seller\u2019s $7,400 loan to the buyer as a down payment on the HUD-1 statement. After Defendant refused to respond to the State Bar\u2019s October 2010 discovery requests, The State Bar moved to compel her response on 4 January 2011. On 13 January 2011, the DHC entered an order allowing the motion to compel. On the same date, Defendant sent an email response to the chair of the DHC hearing committee stating:\nI reviewed your bogus Order to Compel. I will not be producing anything. In fact, I will not be in communication with any of you people ever again.\nI will not be at the February hearing.\nI am moving on with my life. You have no power over me. You are mistaken to think that you do. You are fully aware that Mrs. [Leanor] Hodge [the attorney handling the matter for the State Bar] is lying. Apparently, this is the status quo.\nDefendant did not comply with the order and the State Bar moved for sanctions against her. In her objection to the motion for sanctions, Defendant asserted that the State Bar\u2019s \u201ccontinued requests for documents . . . are duplicitous and harassing in nature.\u201d The DHC denied the State Bar\u2019s motion for sanctions by order entered 23 February 2011.\nAt a hearing before a three-member DHC panel on 3 February 2011, the State Bar presented evidence that, in the July 2007 closing, Defendant represented the buyer and his lender. Paul Johnson, the lender\u2019s closing officer handling the loan, first sent Defendant instructions calling for a down payment of $22,700 and prohibiting secondary financing without the lender\u2019s written approval. However, the buyer had received two loans toward the down payment: $14,800 dollars from National Home and $9,400 from the seller. On 17 July 2007, the day of the closing, Defendant prepared a draft HUD-1 statement for the closing showing \u201cDown Payment [of] $7,400\u201d as a credit to the buyer, debited $7,400 from the proceeds due to the seller, showed \u201cCommission earned [of] $14,800\u201d from National Home as a contribution from the buyer, and showed a deduction from the proceeds due to the seller of $14,800 as a seller fee to National Home. Defendant testified that Johnson had instructed her via phone call and fax to record the amounts in this manner. Defendant transmitted the draft to Johnson, who stamped it \u201cAPPROVED\u201d and initialed it \u201cPJ\u201d with the date \u201c7-17\u201d before returning it to Defendant.\nDefendant, the buyer and his agent, and the seller\u2019s agent were present in Defendant\u2019s office for the closing, while the seller participated by teleconference, email, and fax. Defendant testified that the HUD statement signed by herself, the buyer, and the seller was the PJ HUD statement, which showed entries regarding the $7,400 and $14,800 amounts as approved by the closing agent. The final PJ HUD statement was three pages instead of the standard two pages because the seller participated by fax. Thus, the first two pages were identical except that the buyer had signed the first and the seller had signed the second, receiving and returning it via fax. Defendant testified that, after the closing was concluded, she sent the signed PJ HUD statement along with other closing documents to the lender via FedEx. At the hearing, Defendant produced a fax from Johnson, dated two days after the closing, requesting that Defendant correct some wording on the title commitment, one of the documents Defendant had sent to the lender in the package of closing documents. Defendant also produced a copy of the PJ HUD statement from her files at the hearing.\nThe State Bar offered testimony from an employee of the lender that the lender\u2019s file contained a substantially different HUD statement (\u201cthe MG HUD statement\u201d) than that produced by Defendant. The MG HUD statement was only two pages long, showed the initials \u201cMG\u201d instead of \u201cPJ,\u201d and had the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s signatures together on the first page. The seller\u2019s signature was forged. In addition, the MG HUD statement lacked the $7,400 and $14,800 entries contained on the PJ HUD statement and instead showed a $22,700 down payment by the buyer. The lender\u2019s representative testified that the PJ HUD statement was not part of the lender\u2019s file. Defendant testified that she had never seen the MG HUD statement prior to the hearing, had not prepared it, and knew nothing about the seller\u2019s forged signature.\nAt the close of the hearing, the DHC panel made oral findings that Defendant had committed fraud and criminal violations, and ordered Defendant\u2019s disbarment. In its written order filed 23 February 2011, the DHC made detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, again ordering disbarment. Specifically, conclusion of law 2 states that Defendant violated the Rules of Professional Conduct:\na. By falsely representing on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement that she provided to the buyer and seller . . . that the proceeds of the National Home loan were a \u201cCommission Earned\u201d and the seller\u2019s loan was a \u201cDown Payment\u201d and by providing the lender with a HUD-1 Settlement Statement that failed to disclose these loans, Defendant committed a criminal act that reflects adversely on her honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b), and engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c); and\nb. By concealing from the lender the fact that the buyer obtained subordinate financing for his purchase of [the real property], defendant engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c).\nOn 29 March 2011, Defendant moved the DHC to reconsider; the DHC denied the motion. Defendant appeals from the 23 February 2011 order and from the denial of her motion to reconsider.\nDiscussion\nDefendant makes four arguments: that the DHC denied her due process by conducting the hearing on the basis of allegations of fraud materially different from those alleged in the complaint; that the evidence did not support the finding of fact that Defendant was the source of the MG HUD statement; that the evidence did not support the finding of fact and conclusion of law that Defendant knowingly misrepresented the source of the buyer\u2019s down payment; and that the DHC imposed a disproportionate and unwarranted discipline on Defendant. For the reasons discussed herein, we reverse the DHC\u2019s order.\nDue Process Claim\nDefendant first argues that the DHC denied her due process by conducting the hearing on the basis of allegations of fraud which materially differ from those alleged in the complaint. We agree.\nNotice and an opportunity to be heard prior to depriving a person of his property are essential elements of due process of law which is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Accordingly, prior to the imposi tion of sanctions, a party has a due process right to notice both (1) of the fact that sanctions may be imposed, and (2) the alleged grounds for the imposition of sanctions.\nIn re Small, 201 N.C. App. 390, 395, 689 S.E.2d 482, 485-86 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted), disc. review denied, 364 N.C. 240, 698 S.E.2d 654 (2010). An attorney facing disbarment is entitled to \u201cprocedural due process, which includes fair notice of the charge\u201d made against her. In re Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 550, 20 L. Ed. 2d 117, 122 (1968). The rules of the State Bar provide that \u201c[p]leadings and proceedings before a hearing panel [of the DHC] will conform as nearly as practicable with requirements of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and for trials of nonjury civil causes in the superior courts except as otherwise provided herein.\u201d 27 N.C.A.C. Ch. 1, Sub. B .0114(h). The North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, in turn, require a complaint to include a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim sufficiently particular to give the court and the parties notice of the transactions, occurrences, or series of transactions or occurrences, intended to be proved showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\u201d N.C.R. Civ. R, Rule 8(a)(1) (2011). Further, the State Bar\u2019s own rules state that \u201c[c]omplaints in disciplinary actions will allege the charges with sufficient precision to clearly apprise the defendant of the conduct which is the subject of the complaint.\u201d 27 N.C.A.C. Ch. 1, Sub. B .0114(c).\nHere, the complaint contains only one allegation of misconduct: that \u201cDefendant purposefully represented on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement [of the relevant closing] that the proceeds of the seller\u2019s loan to the buyer were a down payment made by the buyer [knowing this] was a false representation.\u201d As noted supra, the PJ HUD statement listed the seller\u2019s loan to the buyer as \u201cDown Payment [of] $7,400[.]\u201d The complaint further alleges this action to be in violation of Rule 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, subsections (b) (\u201ccommi[ssion] of a criminal act\u201d) and (c) (\u201cengaging] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d). Thus, the complaint alleged a single false representation by Defendant in violation of the Rules: the entry of the $7,400 loan as a \u201cDown Payment\u201d on the PJ HUD statement.\nHowever, at the hearing, the State Bar presented evidence of different alleged acts of fraud and additional alleged misrepresentations, to wit, that Defendant had produced and submitted to the lender the MG HUD statement, which contained different financial information and included a forged signature purporting to be the seller\u2019s. Because these allegations were not contained in the complaint, Defendant was not prepared to refute or defend against them. Indeed, nothing in the record suggests that Defendant was aware that the MG HUD statement existed. When the State Bar sought to introduce the MG HUD statement at the hearing, Defendant objected, stating that she had never seen it before and had not prepared it. At the close of the hearing, Defendant noted that the complaint only alleged misrepresentations about the source of the down payment listed on the PJ HUD statement and, as a result, \u201cmy understanding is that was the only issue that required me to formulate a defense for today.\u201d\nThe State Bar first contends that, because Defendant was properly served with a copy of the subpoena to the lender requesting its account records from the loan closing at issue, she also received sufficient notice of any additional allegation which might arise from review of those documents. Thus, the State Bar asserts that Defendant cannot argue a lack of due process because she did not ask to examine the documents produced by the lender before the hearing. However, as the State Bar concedes, it never informed Defendant that the documents had been obtained, in violation of Rule 45(d1) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. It can be reasonably inferred that the State Bar\u2019s violation of Rule 45(d1) would have indicated to Defendant that no documents had been received from the lender. We decline to hold that a party waives her due process rights by failing to request documents which the opposing party has implied do not exist and will not be part of the case against her.\nMoreover, per the complaint, Defendant believed she need only prepare a defense to the allegation that the $7,400 entry on the PJ HUD statement was a false representation. She brought to the hearing the materials she apparently believed would constitute a defense against that allegation: her testimony that Johnson instructed her to list the $7,400 loan as a down payment on the HUD statement, a copy of the PJ HUD statement showing that the lender\u2019s agent had approved it, and the fax from Johnson sent two days after closing which suggested the lender had received the closing documents. We see no way that Defendant could have anticipated the addition of the allegations against her regarding the MG HUD statement, much less prepare a defense against them.\nWe likewise reject the State Bar\u2019s assertion that Defendant\u2019s due process rights were protected because \u201cevidence of [Defendant\u2019s] additional falsification of documents was cumulative and did not contradict the misconduct identified in the complaint that [she] had knowingly falsified information on the HUD-1 settlement statement\u201d and because the DHC concluded that Defendant had violated the same two Rules of Professional Conduct cited in the complaint. As the State Bar notes, the hearing and subsequent order dealt with \u201cadditional falsification of documents[.]\u201d These additional alleged falsifications were far more than simply cumulative. Rather, they were different both in kind and in fact. The complaint advanced the theory that Defendant made false representations about the $7,400 loan on the PJ HUD statement. The theory advanced by the State Bar at the hearing was that Defendant created an entirely different HUD statement (the MG HUD statement) which did not list a $7,400 down payment, but rather listed a down payment of $22,700, and further contained a forgery of the seller\u2019s signature. The allegations in the complaint did not \u201callege [these] charges with sufficient precision to clearly apprise\u201d Defendant of the conduct which she would have to defend at the hearing. 27 N.C.A.C. Ch. 1, Sub. B .0114(c). As such, the State Bar violated its own rules as well as Defendant\u2019s due process rights.\nThe State Bar also contends that Defendant waived her due process rights and consented to consideration of the additional issues by failing to object to admission of the MG HUD statement or testimony about it. However, waiver of the right to due process must be made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. Estate of Barber v. Guilford Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Dept., 161 N.C. App. 658, 664, 589 S.E.2d 433, 437 (2003). As noted supra, Defendant stated during the hearing that \u201cmy understanding is that [the misrepresentation alleged in the complaint] was the only issue that required me to formulate a defense for today.\u201d This statement indicates Defendant believed she was facing only the allegation in the complaint and was not prepared to defend any others; it does not suggest that she was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waiving her right to due process.\nThus, the DHC erred in making findings of fact and conclusions of law about any alleged wrongdoing by Defendant beyond the listing of the $7,400 loan from the seller to the buyer as a down payment on the PJ HUD statement. Accordingly, we vacate the following portions of the DHC order on due process grounds: findings of fact 11-13, 17-19, and the parts of findings of fact 21-23 and conclusion of law 2(a) which refer to the $14,800 \u201cCommission Earned\u201d from National Home or the MG HUD statement received by the lender. We also vacate the entirety of conclusion of law 2(b), which states that Defendant concealed the buyer\u2019s subordinate financing from the lender. To the extent this portion of conclusion of law 2 refers to information contained in the MG HUD statement, it violates Defendant\u2019s due process rights. To the extent it refers to information contained in the PJ HUD statement, it is not supported by competent evidence, as explained infra.\nSufficiency of the Evidence\nWe must also vacate findings of fact 24 and 27 in their entirety, and the remaining portions of findings of fact 22-23 and conclusion of law 2(a) as not supported by competent evidence.\nThese findings and conclusions relate to Defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations about the source of the $7,400 \u201cdown payment\u201d listed on the PJ HUD statement, a matter alleged in the complaint and thus properly before the DHC at the hearing. The State Bar\u2019s complaint did not specify to whom this false representation was supposedly made. However, it could not have been the buyer or the seller since both were fully aware that the $7,400 \u201cdown payment\u201d was actually a loan from the seller to the buyer. Nor could the $7,400 \u201cdown payment\u201d have been a false representation to the lender, since the State Bar\u2019s theory was that Defendant never sent the signed PJ HUD statement to the lender, instead creating and submitting the fraudulent MG HUD statement in its place. The uncontradicted testimony of the lender\u2019s representative was that the lender\u2019s file contained only the MG HUD statement. The lender can hardly have been misled or deceived by information contained in a document which it never received. Likewise, to the extent conclusion of law 2(b) refers to information contained in the PJ HUD statement, it is not supported by competent evidence and is vacated.\nHaving vacated the findings of fact noted above and the entirety of conclusion of law 2, there is no support for the DHC\u2019s \u201cAdditional Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline\u201d 2 or \u201cConclusions of Law Regarding Discipline\u201d 1, 2(a), 3-4, and 6. The only remaining additional finding of fact and conclusion of law regarding discipline state that Defendant refused to comply with a 13 January 2011 order (\u201cthe discovery order\u201d) from the DHC compelling her response to discovery requests by the State Bar which interfered with the State Bar\u2019s ability to regulate attorneys to the detriment of the legal profession.\nHowever, Defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery order was also the subject of an order (\u201cthe sanctions order\u201d) filed by the same DHC panel on the same date as the order of discipline (23 February 2011). In the sanctions order, the DHC found that Defendant had failed to comply with the discovery order, but denied the State Bar\u2019s motion for sanctions against Defendant because her noncompliance \u201cdid not unduly prejudice the State Bar\u2019s case[.]\u201d In other words, the DHC panel had already determined that Defendant\u2019s failure to- comply with the discovery order was not sanctionable. Thus, that misconduct, standing alone, cannot serve as the basis for Defendant\u2019s disbarment or imposition of any other sanction. Accordingly, the order of discipline disbarring Defendant is\nREVERSED.\nChief Judge MARTIN and Judge HUNTER, ROBERT C., concur.\n. Originally, the seller had agreed to a $7,400 loan to the buyer, but at closing, the buyer was still $2,000 short of the funds needed for his down payment. During the closing, the seller agreed to loan the buyer an additional $2,000, for a total loan amount of $9,400, and instructed Defendant to draft a promissory note. However, Defendant continued to list the amount as $7,400 on the HUD-1 statement she prepared. At the DHC hearing, Defendant acknowledged this error, which she asserts was unintentional and merely clerical. The error in the amount of this loan was not part of any allegations by the State Bar against Defendant.\n. This HUD statement will be referred to as \u201cthe PJ HUD statement.\u201d\n. The lender\u2019s representative at the hearing had not participated in the closing and had no knowledge about it beyond having reviewed the records that he produced from the lender\u2019s file. Johnson was not a witness at the hearing.\n. The DHC order does not identify the HUD-1 statements by their initials. However, all references to the HUD-1 statement \u201ccontained in the lender\u2019s file\u201d or \u201cpro vided to the lender\u201d must be interpreted as references to the MG HUD statement since the lender\u2019s file produced at the hearing contained only the MG HUD statement.\n. Indeed, the buyer and seller had Defendant draw up a promissory note for the loan as part of the closing transaction.", "author": "STEPHENS, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE BAR, Plaintiff v.

Keith Teague and wife, Penny Teague; Danny Glover, Jr. and wife, Meredith Glover; and Teague & Glover, P.A. (the Teague Defendants), and dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for reformation of a deed of trust from Defendants Robert E. Gibbs, Jr., and Nina B. Gibbs to BB&T; the imposition of an equitable lien on property that Plaintiffs seek to have made subject to the deed of trust; and the foreclosure of the reformed deed of trust. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\nIn 1984, Ms. Gibbs began working for Teague & Glover as a bookkeeper. After learning that Ms. Gibbs had embezzled substantial sums from the law firm over a period of years, Teague & Glover terminated Ms. Gibbs\u2019 employment. Ms. Gibbs was criminally prosecuted and imprisoned as a result of her activities. In addition, Teague & Glover filed a civil suit against the Gibbs . In March 2010, Teague & Glover obtained a judgment against the Gibbs requiring the payment in damages in excess of $800,000. Subsequently, Defendants made an arrangement with the Gibbs under which they agreed to transfer all of their real and personal property to Teague & Glover in exchange for a reduction in the total amount of the judgment.\nThe property that underlies the present dispute consists of approximately 1.3 acres and is divided into two tracts: Tract A, an undeveloped tract containing about .6 acres, and Tract B, which contains the remainder of the property and includes the Gibbs\u2019 primary residence. The Gibbs obtained loans from BB&T in 1999 and 2005, each of which was secured by a deed of trust applicable to the entire 1.3 acre parcel. On 3 March 2009, the Gibbs obtained a new loan from BB&T in the amount of approximately $94,000, with this total representing the outstanding principal obligation associated with the earlier loans. The 3 March 2009 loan was secured by a deed of trust applicable solely to Tract A. At the time that the Gibbs deeded the property to the Teagues and the Glovers, the recipients took the property subject to the deed of trust applicable to Tract A without assuming responsibility for the underlying debt secured by that instrument.\nAfter obtaining title to the property, the Teague Defendants commissioned a survey which disclosed, among other things, that Tract A was the only part of the overall parcel subject to the deed of trust. In August 2010, the Teagues and the Glovers sold the property at an auction sale at which they informed prospective bidders that the property was subject to a lien secured by a deed of trust applicable to a portion of the property.\nOn 17 August 2010, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in which they sought reformation of the 2009 deed of trust from the Gibbs to BB&T so as to include Tract B as additional collateral associated with the loan that BB&T had made to the Gibbs, the imposition of an equitable lien on the entire parcel, and the foreclosure of the reformed deed of trust. On 19 August 2010, Plaintiffs filed a notice of lis pendens applicable to the entire tract pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-116. On 8 November 2010, the Teague Defendants filed an answer in which they denied having had any knowledge that there was a \u201cdispute\u201d concerning the scope of the deed of trust or that a \u201cmistake\u201d had been made in the deed of trust. On 15 February 2011, the Teague Defendants filed a summary judgment motion. On 18 March 2011, Plaintiffs filed a cross motion for summary judgment. The parties\u2019 motions were heard by the trial court on 28 March 2011. On 11 April 2011, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of the Teague Defendants. From this order, Plaintiffs now appeal.\nI.\nPlaintiffs argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the Teague Defendants on the issue of whether Plaintiffs were entitled to reformation of the deed. In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the reformed deed of trust should relate back to the date of original execution, thereby giving it priority over the deed from the Gibbs to the Teagues and Glovers. We disagree.\nAccording to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2011), summary judgment is properly granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cThe party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002) (citing DeWitt v. Eveready Battery Co., 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002)). \u201c[O]nce the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least establish a prima facie case at trial.\u201d Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784-85, 534 S.E.2d 660, 664 (2000).\nWhen the court reforms an instrument in connection with the imposition of an equitable or parol trust, \u201c[t]he general rule is that reformation will not be granted if prejudice would result to the rights of a bona fide purchaser for value without notice or someone occupying a similar status.\u201d Arnette v. Morgan, 88 N.C. App. 485, 462, 363 S.E.2d 678, 680 (1988). The undisputed evidence before the trial court reflects that, after the execution and recordation of the deed of trust, the Gibbs deeded the parcel to the Teagues and Glovers in exchange for a $200,000 reduction in the amount of the judgment that Teague & Glover had obtained against the Gibbs. Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute that this $200,000 reduction in the amount of Teague & Glovers\u2019 judgment against the Gibbs constituted the provision of valuable con sideration in return for the underlying transfer, since a grantor who cancels or reduces a grantee\u2019s preexisting debt in exchange for a deed is a bona fide purchaser for value. See Sansom v. Warren, 215 N.C. 432, 436, 2 S.E.2d 459, 461 (1939).\nIn addition, the parties appear to agree that the undisputed record evidence establishes that, at the time the Gibbs executed the deed to the Teagues and the Glovers in exchange for a reduction in the amount owed under the judgments, the Teague Defendants had no notice that Plaintiffs or the Gibbs Defendants claimed that there was an error in the deed of trust that the Gibbs had given to BB&T for the purpose of securing the 2009 loan that BB&T had extended to the Gibbs. In fact, Plaintiffs concede that the deed from the Gibbs to the Teagues and the Glovers was executed and recorded on 19 May 2010 and that, \u201c[o]nly after [their] survey was completed in June 2010 did the Law Firm and the Teagues and Glovers learn that the property description in the 2009 Deed of Trust did not describe the entire Property but only described [Tract A].\u201d As a result, we conclude that the Teagues and the Glovers were bona fide purchasers for value who took the property in question without notice of the alleged defect in the deed of trust applicable to the property. For that reason, we need not decide whether the deed of trust rested upon a mutual mistake of fact or whether an equitable lien or parol trust should have been imposed because, even if the omission of Tract B from the property utilized to secure the loan from BB&T to the Gibbs resulted from a mutual mistake of the parties or should have otherwise led to the imposition of a parol trust or an equitable lien, any reformed deed of trust would not have priority over the deed from the Gibbs to the Teagues and the Glovers.\nAlthough Plaintiffs acknowledge that reformation of a deed of trust based upon a mutual mistake or the imposition of an equitable lien or parol trust will not be allowed to prejudice the rights of a bona fide purchaser for value, they argue that the Teague Defendants are not entitled to that status. Plaintiffs\u2019 contention rests on the assertion that \u201ceach case must be evaluated on its specific facts in order to determine whether any third party actually relied on the public record, and whether reformation would prejudice an innocent purchaser for value.\u201d The position espoused by Plaintiffs essentially assumes that, in addition to demonstrating that the Teagues and the Glovers obtained a deed to the property for valuable consideration and without notice of the alleged error in the deed of trust, the Teague Defendants must also adduce evidence that, in reaching the decision to accept a deed to the property in exchange for reducing the amount of the judgment that Teague & Glover had obtained against the Gibbs, they \u201cactually relied\u201d on the allegedly erroneous provisions of the deed of trust. In support of this argument, Plaintiffs rely upon \u201cthe general principles of reformation,\u201d which they contend render \u201cthe recording statutes ... inapplicable,\u201d and argue that their position is supported by this Court\u2019s decision in Noel Williams Masonry v. Vision Contractors of Charlotte, 103 N.C. App. 597, 406 S.E.2d 605 (1991). We disagree.\nIn Williams Masonry, a contractor obtained a construction loan from a lending institution for use in developing a piece of property. The loan in question was secured by a deed of trust that failed to include a legal description specifically identifying the property utilized to secure the loan. Subsequently, the contractor entered into contracts with several subcontractors under which the subcontractors agreed to supply labor and materials for use in connection with construction activities on the property. After the contractor failed to pay the subcontractors, the subcontractors filed claims of lien against the property. Subsequently, the lending institution discovered the error in the deed of trust and recorded a corrected deed of trust. The trial court allowed reformation of the deed of trust and held that the reformed deed of trust related back to the date upon which the' original deed of trust had been recorded, effectively giving the lending institution priority over the subcontractors\u2019 lien claims. On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling, holding, in reliance upon the logic set out in Arnette, 88 N.C. App. at 460-62, 363 S.E.2d at 679-81, that the lender was entitled to the imposition of a parol trust on the property used to secure the loan and that the subcontractors should not be accorded the status of bona fide purchasers for value without notice given the absence of any evidence tending to show that they had either relied on the terms of the deed of trust in contracting with the contractor or had properly searched the public record for notice of defects in the deed of trust.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the trial court\u2019s order in reliance on Williams Masonry is tantamount to a contention that they were entitled to have a parol trust or equitable lien imposed upon Tract B. However, Williams Masonry and our recent decision in S.T. Wooten Corp. v. Front Street Construction, LLC, _ N.C. App. _, _, 719 S.E.2d 249, 252 (2011) (upholding reformation of a deed under Williams Masonry despite an intervening claim of lien because the lien creditor \u201cdid not begin work or furnish new materials in reliance upon the error in the original deed\u201d or \u201cknow of the mistake in the deed\u201d), are readily distinguishable from the facts present here. In Williams Masonry, the subcontractors did not hold a deed or deed of trust applicable to the property. As a result, the specific issue before the Court in Williams Masonry was whether the subcontractors \u201cshould be given the status of bona fide purchasers for value.\u201d Williams Masonry, 103 N.C. App at 603, 408 S.E.2d at 608. In declining to afford the subcontractors that status, we noted that, \u201c [although each subcontractor contributed labor and materials to the property, there is no evidence that the consideration was given on the faith of the ownership of the property . . . free and clear of any deed of trust.\u201d Id. In other words, the subcontractors provided labor and materials pursuant to a contract with the contractor under which they would be paid for their work; as might be expected, the contract between the contractor and the subcontractors had no legal relationship to the terms of the deed of trust securing the loan on the property that had been obtained by the contractor. Though the deed of trust was not part of the contract under which the subcontractors provided labor and materials at the development, the subcontractors had not checked the public record to determine whether there was any notice that the deed of trust was defective. Thus, we concluded that there was no legal basis for treating the subcontractors as bona fide purchasers for value without notice entitled to protection from reformation based upon the imposition of a parol trust or equitable lien.\nAfter carefully reviewing the record and the briefs and the applicable decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court, we conclude that Williams Masonry is focused solely upon situations involving a party who, although not a bona fide purchaser for value, wishes to be treated as if it were one for purposes of resisting reformation based upon the imposition of a parol trust or an equitable lien. Williams Masonry did not hold that an actual bona fide purchaser for value without notice, such as the Teagues and the Glovers, must, in addition to providing consideration, establish specific reliance on the allegedly defective portions of a deed or deed of trust in making a particular business decision or satisfy any other additional requirements. Instead, Williams Masonry held that parties who are not actual bona fide purchasers for value will not be treated as having that status in a situation involving reformation arising from the imposition \u00f3f a parol trust in the event that there is no connection between their contract with the grantor of a deed of trust and the terms of that instrument.\nIn this case, however, the Teagues and the Glovers are indisputably bona fide purchasers for value. The undisputed record evidence establishes that the Teagues and the Glovers hold a deed to the entire tract of property and that their interest in the property is explicitly subject to the lien created by the deed of trust. For that reason, the Teagues and the Glovers are not lienholders claiming to be entitled to the same treatment as a bona fide purchaser for value\u2014they actually are bona fide purchasers for value. As a result, even if Plaintiffs were otherwise entitled to the imposition of a parol trust or equitable lien applicable to Tract B, this fact would not overcome the rights of the Teagues and the Glovers as bona fide purchasers for value without notice. Thus, we conclude that the logic underlying Williams Masonry is not controlling in this case, so that any failure on the part of the Teague Defendants to establish that they \u201crelied\u201d on the alleged error in the deed of trust in deciding to take a deed in exchange for a reduction in the judgment amount is beside the point.\nII.\nSecondly, Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Teague Defendants where they had not established they would be prejudiced by reformation of the deed. We agree.\nIn essence, Plaintiffs argue that, since the Teague Defendants \u201chad to have expected\u201d that the loan would be repaid in connection with the foreclosure process and since the Teague Defendants did not rely on the terms of the deed of trust during their negotiations with the Gibbs, the Teague Defendants would receive \u201cexactly what they bargained for\u201d in the event that \u201cthe 2009 Deed of Trust is reformed.\u201d\nIt is axiomatic that when this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, the \u201c[e]vidence presented by the parties is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.\u201d Summey v. Barker, 357 N.C. 492, 496, 586 S.E.2d 247, 249 (2003) (citing Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, 835 (2000)). Here, the uncontroverted evidence shows that the value of Plaintiffs lien was subtracted from the fair market value of the property when the amount to credit the judgment was determined. When that fact is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, whether Defendants would be prejudiced by reformation of the deed is a genuine issue of material fact. As such, summary judgment on this particular issue was not proper, and the case should be remanded to the lower court for consideration of potential prejudice to Defendants.\nIII.\nFinally, Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to have an equitable lien imposed upon the entire parcel. Plaintiffs have not, however, asserted that the Teague Defendants have breached an oral agreement with Plaintiffs or that the Teague Defendants have acted inconsistently with some sort of a fiduciary or contractual obligation that they owed to Plaintiffs. In essence, Plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate complaint is nothing more or less than a disagreement with the priority rules established by the relevant statutory provisions as construed by the Supreme Court and this Court. \u201cIssues of public policy should [, however,] be addressed to the legislature.\u201d Allen v. Allen, 76 N.C. App. 504, 507, 333 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1985) (citing Skinner v. Whitley, 281 N.C. 476, 484, 189 S.E.2d 230, 235 (1972)). As a result, Plaintiffs are not entitled to have Tract B subjected to an equitable lien in their favor.\nThus, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order should be, and hereby is, affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.\nAffirmed in Part; Reversed and Remanded in Part.\nJudge THIGPEN concurs.\nJudge ERVIN concurs in part and dissents in part in separate opinion.\n. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also named Nina B. Gibbs; her husband, Robert E. Gibbs, Jr. (both individually and in their capacity as Co-Trustees of the Gibbs Family Revocable Trust); and the Gibbs Family Revocable Trust (the Gibbs Defendants) as parties defendant. After the entry of summary judgment in favor of the Teague Defendants, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the Gibbs Defendants, who have not participated in this appeal.\n. Although Plaintiffs and the Teague Defendants refer to Mr. and Ms. Gibbs as \u201cthe Gibbs,\u201d the proper plural form of the name Gibbs is \u201cGibbses.\u201d For continuity, we also refer to the Gibbses as \u201cthe Gibbs.\u201d\n. In light of that fact, we need not give separate consideration to the issue of whether Teague & Glover had bona fide purchaser for value status, given that the interest held by the Teagues and the Glovers is sufficient to preclude reformation of the deed of trust.\n. In light of our decision with respect to this issue, we need not address the other arguments advanced by the parties in reliance on the logic utilized in Williams Masonry.", "author": "BEASLEY, Judge.", "type": "majority"}, {"text": "ERVIN, Judge,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\nAlthough I concur in the Court\u2019s determinations that the Teagues and the Glovers were bona fide purchasers for value; that Plaintiffs were not entitled to reformation of the deed of trust; and that the holding in Williams Masonry is not controlling in the present case, I am unable to agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Defendants would be preju diced by reformation of the deed of trust. As a result, I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion in part and dissent in part.\n\u201c \u2018A genuine issue of material fact arises when \u2018the facts alleged . . . are of such nature as to affect the result of the action.\u2019 \u201d N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sadler, 365 N.C. 179, 182, 711 S.E.2d 114, 116 (2011) (quoting Kessing v. Nat\u2019l Mortg. Corp., 278 N.C. 523, 534, 180 S.E.2d 823, 830 (1971)) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also City of Thomasville v. Lease-Afex, Inc., 300 N.C. 651, 654, 268 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1980) (stating that \u201c[a]n issue is material if, as alleged, facts would constitute a legal defense, or would affect the result of the action or if its resolution would prevent the party against whom it is resolved from prevailing in the action\u201d). The ultimate issue about which the Court and I disagree is the extent, if any, to which the existence of a factual dispute about the manner in which the size of the credit that the Gibbs\u2019 received against the Teague & Glover judgment would constitute a genuine issue of material fact.\nAccording to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, \u201cprejudice\u201d is defined as \u201c[d]amage or detriment to one\u2019s legal rights of claims.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1218 (8th ed. 2004). In light of that definition, I believe that any \u201cprejudice\u201d determination requires a \u201cbefore and after\u201d comparison involving the nature and extent of a party\u2019s legal rights \u201cwith or without\u201d the relevant event. As I understand the present record, there is no dispute that (1) Defendants were deeded a tract of property of which only Tract A, which contains less than half the total amount of property previously owned by the Gibbs and which does not include the residence that had been constructed on the property, was encumbered by Plaintiff\u2019s deed of trust; (2) if the Gibbs fail to meet their obligation under the deed of trust, the bank is only entitled to foreclose upon Tract A, rather than the entire tract of property previously owned by the Gibbs; (3) if the deed of trust were reformed in accordance with Plaintiff\u2019s request, the entire tract of property, including both Tract A and the remainder of the overall tract, would then be encumbered by Plaintiff\u2019s deed of trust; and (4) if the Gibbs defaulted on their obligation to Plaintiff after reformation, Plaintiff would be able to foreclose on the entire tract of property rather than just on Tract A. As a result, reformation would result in a change from a situation in which the larger and more desirable portion of the property in question was unencumbered to one in which the entire property is encumbered. In my view, such an outcome clearly constitutes \u201cdamage or detriment\u201d to the Teagues\u2019 and Glovers\u2019 \u201clegal rights\u201d sufficient to compel a finding of \u201cprejudice\u201d regardless of the other factors upon which the Court relies.\nAs the Court correctly observes, \u201cPlaintiffs argue that, since the Teague Defendants \u2018had to have expected\u2019 that the loan would be repaid in connection with the foreclosure process and since the Teague Defendants did not rely on the terms of the deed of trust during their negotiations with the Gibbses, the Teague Defendants would receive \u2018exactly what they bargained for\u2019 in the event that \u2018the 2009 Deed of Trust is reformed.\u2019 \u201d This argument, which the Court obviously accepts, does not rest upon a comparison between the nature and extent of Defendants\u2019 legal rights with or without reformation of the deed of trust. Instead, the Court appears to compare the economic effect of reformation with Defendants\u2019 subjective expectations regarding the economic value of the bargain they made with the Gibbs. Put another way, the Court, consistently with Plaintiff\u2019s argument, assumes that, if the amount of the debt owed by the Gibbs to BB&T was utilized in calculating the amount of credit which the Gibbs were entitled to receive against the Teague & Glover judgment in return for deeding the entire parcel to the Teagues and the Glovers, then the Teague Defendants would be unable to show the necessary prejudice.\nThe approach adopted by the Court is inconsistent with the manner in which I believe that the prejudice inquiry should be conducted. As I understand the appropriate prejudice inquiry, which should rest upon a \u201cbefore and after\u201d comparison of the type outlined above, the various factors, both objective and subjective, upon which Defendants relied in deciding how much to credit the Gibbs for the deed to the property are legally irrelevant to the issue of whether Defendants would be prejudiced by reformation of the deed of trust encumbering the property. As a result, the evidence upon which the Court relies in reversing the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to the prejudice issue does not relate to a \u201cmaterial\u201d issue of fact, because resolution of this issue would not affect the outcome of the case. Thus, since the Court reaches a contrary conclusion, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to remand this case to the trial court for consideration of this issue,while concurring with the remainder of its opinion.", "author": "ERVIN, Judge,", "type": "concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part"}], "parties": ["BRANCH BANKING & TRUST COMPANY and BB&T COLLATERAL SERVICE CORPORATION, as Trustee, Plaintiffs v.

North Carolina does not recognize \u201cholder\u201d claims. The trial court correctly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.\nI. Factual and Procedural History\nOn 1 October 2009, seven stockholders (plaintiffs) of Wachovia Corporation filed this action. Defendants include Wachovia Corporation (Wachovia), Wells Fargo & Company (Wells Fargo), KPMG LLP (KPMG), and past directors of Wachovia. Plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants participated in a fraudulent scheme to deceive plaintiffs and the public as to Wachovia\u2019s financial stability.\nPlaintiffs contend that Wachovia\u2019s 2006 acquisition of Golden West Financial Corporation, a bank and mortgage lender with a large portfolio of adjustable-rate mortgages, caused Wachovia to suffer unprecedented losses. Plaintiffs contend that the individual defendants concealed information regarding underwriting standards, collateral quality, and necessary reserves for loans. Plaintiffs further contend that defendants issued false public SEC filings, press releases, and earnings calls regarding Wachovia\u2019s financial strength and stability through September 2008. Plaintiffs assert that they relied on these representations in deciding to retain Wachovia stock in 2005 through 2008.\nIn late September 2008, the price of Wachovia\u2019s stock fell below $1 per share. Later that year, Wells Fargo consummated a merger with Wachovia and acquired all outstanding shares of Wachovia stock. Wachovia shareholders, including plaintiffs, received 0.1991 shares of Wells Fargo common stock in exchange for each share of Wachovia common stock that they owned.\nThe complaint alleges \u201cCount I Negligence, Misrepresentation and Breach of Duty of a Corporate Director and/or Officer (Against the Wachovia Corporate Defendants and the Individual Defendants)\u201d and \u201cCount II Negligent Misrepresentation (Against the Auditor Defendant, KPMG)[.]\u201d\nDefendants filed motions to dismiss under N.C.R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). On 3 March 2011, the trial court entered an Order and Opinion, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.\nPlaintiffs appeal.\nII. Analysis\nPlaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. We disagree.\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review de novo the trial court\u2019s order granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. Leary v. N.C. Forest Prods., Inc., 157 N.C. App. 396, 400, 580 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2003).\nWhen considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, [t]he question for the court is whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal theory, whether properly labeled or not.\nId., 157 N.C. App. at 400, 580 S.E.2d at 4 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nB. Claims Against the Individual Defendants and Wachovia Defendants\n\u201cThe well-established general rule is that shareholders cannot pursue individual causes of action against third parties for wrongs or injuries to the corporation that result in the diminution or destruction of the value of their stock.\u201d Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 658, 488 S.E.2d 215, 219 (1997). The two exceptions to this rule are \u201c(1) where there is a special duty, such as a contractual duty, between the wrongdoer and the shareholder, and (2) where the shareholder suffered an injury separate and distinct from that suffered by other shareholders.\u201d Id.\nAs to the first Barger exception, plaintiffs have alleged no facts indicating that defendants owed plaintiffs a special duty. Plaintiffs do not allege that defendants induced them to become shareholders. See Howell v. Fisher, 49 N.C. App. 488, 497, 272 S.E.2d 19, 25 (1980). Plaintiffs do not allege a duty arising from a particular contract between plaintiffs and defendants. See Barger, 346 N.C. at 659-60, 488 S.E.2d at 220. We hold that the trial court properly held that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not allege sufficient facts to meet the special duty exception of Barger.\nAs to the second Barger exception, plaintiff is required to allege injury that is \u201cseparate and distinct from the injury sustained by the other shareholders or the corporation itself.\u201d Id., 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 219. Plaintiffs contend that misrepresentations concerning the financial condition of Wachovia caused them to retain their stock and suffer grievous financial injury when the value of their shares plummeted. As in Barger, the diminution of the value of their stock is precisely the same injury suffered by the corporation itself. Id., 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 220. Plaintiffs have failed to allege an injury that is separate and distinct from the injury suffered by other shareholders or the corporation. The trial court properly held that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not allege sufficient facts to meet the separate injury exception of Barger.\nPlaintiffs argue that we should follow the rationale of the Delaware case of Tooley v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., 845 A.2d 1031 (Del. 2004), and reject the Barger test. Barger is a decision of our Supreme Court, and we are not free to blithely disregard its holding. See e.g., Cannon v. Miller, 313 N.C. 324, 327 S.E.2d 888 (1985).\nPlaintiffs further contend that North Carolina courts have previously cited Tooley with approval. In Cabaniss v. Deutsche Bank Secs., Inc., 170 N.C. App. 180, 611 S.E.2d 878 (2005), this court cited Tooley in a case where Delaware law controlled. Cabaniss, 170 N.C. App. at 182, 611 S.E.2d at 880. North Carolina law controls the instant case. The remaining cases cited by plaintiffs are decisions of the North Carolina Business Court. The Business Court is a special Superior Court, the decisions of which have no precedential value in North Carolina.\nFurther, in Maurer v. SlickEdit, Inc., 2006 NCBC 1 (N.C.Super. Feb. 6, 2006), the trial court\u2019s mention of Tooley was merely in passing, or obiter dictum. The trial court commented in a footnote that it \u201cleaves consideration of the merits of the Tooley approach for another day.\u201d Maurer, 2006 NCBC 1 n.5. In Marcoux v. Prim, 2004 NCBC 5 (N.C.Super. April 14, 2004), the trial court applied Delaware law. Again, North Carolina law controls the instant case.\nC. Holder Claims\nNext, plaintiffs argue that North Carolina law recognizes a cause of action for holders. In support of this argument, plaintiffs cite Gilbert v. Bagley, 492 F. Supp. 714 (M.D.N.C. 1980), superseded by statute N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-8-30, as recognized in Rivers v. Wachovia Corp., 665 F.3d 610 (4th Cir. 2011). However, the trial court correctly observed that Gilbert relies on the premises that officers and direc tors owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders and that such duty is directly actionable by individual shareholders.\nIn 1989, the General Assembly amended the statutes governing corporations, eliminating the provision that the directors\u2019 duty runs to both the shareholders and the corporation.\nThe drafters recognized that directors have a duty to act for the benefit of all shareholders of the corporation, but they intended to avoid stating a duty owed directly by the directors to the shareholders that might be construed to give shareholders a direct right of action on claims that should be asserted derivatively.\nRussell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina Corporation Law \u00a7 14.01 [2] (7th ed.) (citing Official Commentary, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-8-30 (1989)). Plaintiffs have failed to cite, and our research has not revealed, a single North Carolina case recognizing holder claims. The trial court properly held that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to state a claim.\nD. Claims Against KPMG\nTo state a claim for negligent misrepresentation, a party must allege that it justifiably relied to its detriment on information prepared without reasonable care by one who owed the relying party a duty of care. Brinkman v. Barrett Kays & Assocs., P.A., 155 N.C. App. 738, 742, 575 S.E.2d 40, 43-44 (2003). The element of justifiable reliance requires that the party rely upon information in a transaction. Raritan River Steel Co. v. Cherry, Bekaert & Holland, 322 N.C. 200, 209-10, 367 S.E.2d 609, 614 (1988) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 (1977)).\nPlaintiffs owned their Wachovia shares and did not sell them. Plaintiffs assert a holder claim. After reiterating that North Carolina does not recognize holder claims, the trial court analyzed plaintiffs\u2019 allegations under the standard articulated in jurisdictions that recognize holder claims and found plaintiffs\u2019 allegations to lack specificity. As discussed in the previous section, plaintiffs have failed to cite, and our research has not revealed, any binding authority in North Carolina that recognizes holder claims. We decline to analyze the specificity of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations under a standard discussed in Small v. Fritz Cos., 65 P.3d 1255 (Cal. 2003), which neither interprets North Carolina law nor is binding on this Court. The trial court properly held that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to state a claim against KPMG.\nAFFIRMED.\nChief Judge MARTIN and Judge McGEE concur.\n.

Horn (\u201cRespondent\u201d) appeals from the trial court\u2019s amended order granting summary judgment in favor of Five Oaks Recreational Association, Inc. (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) and authorizing Petitioner to proceed with foreclosure of Respondent\u2019s property. After careful review, we affirm.\nI. Factual & Procedural Background\nPetitioner is a North Carolina non-profit corporation located in Durham. Petitioner maintains recreational facilities for the use and benefit of its members, which generally consist of property owners in the Five Oaks Community. Respondent owns property located at 4302 Pin Oak Drive in Durham\u2014within the Five Oaks Community\u2014and is a member of Petitioner. As a member, Respondent and his property are subject to the terms of Petitioner\u2019s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (\u201cthe Declaration\u201d) as recorded in Book 432, Page 306, of the Durham County Register of Deeds.\nPursuant to the Declaration, Respondent has agreed to pay dues, or \u201cassessments,\u201d to Petitioner to cover the costs of maintaining and operating Petitioner\u2019s recreational facilities. Article X Section 3 of the Declaration provides that the \u201cassessments, together with interest, costs, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for the collection thereof shall be a charge and lien upon the lot of the respective Owners thereof, and the same shall be a continuing lien upon the lot against which each such assessment is made.\u201d The Declaration further provides that if an assessment is not paid within thirty days of its due date, Petitioner has the power to \u201cforeclose the lien against the lot, and interest, costs, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of any such action for collection thereof shall be added to the amount of such assessment.\u201d\nPetitioner\u2019s records indicate that Respondent fell behind on his assessment payments in April 2009 and that he has maintained a past due balance ever since. On 13 August 2010, Petitioner notified Respondent by letter that Respondent owed $458.00 in unpaid assessments. Petitioner cautioned Respondent that it would exercise its power under the Declaration to file a claim of lien against Respondent\u2019s property\u2014and possibly institute foreclosure proceedings\u2014if Respondent failed to arrange for payment of his past due balance within fifteen days.\nPetitioner received no response from Respondent and retained counsel to assist in Petitioner\u2019s debt collection efforts. By letter dated 21 September 2010, Petitioner\u2019s counsel informed Respondent of his statutory obligation to pay Petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred through collection of Respondent\u2019s debt in addition to the debt itself. Petitioner indicated that Respondent\u2019s debt, including attorney\u2019s fees, totaled $533.00, and, moreover, that any payments made by Respondent would be applied \u201cin the following order: (1) to any fines accrued upon [Respondent\u2019s] assessment account; (2) attorneys fees incurred in the collection of those fines or in the collection of [Respondent\u2019s] past due assessments; (3) costs, including administrative costs; (4) late fees; and (5) past due assessments.\u201d The letter directed Respondent to tender all payments through Petitioner\u2019s counsel.\nAs of 11 October 2010, Petitioner had not received a response from Respondent. Petitioner sent Respondent a copy of the claim of lien that it was in the process of filing against Respondent\u2019s property pursuant to its authority under the Declaration. Petitioner indicated the claim of lien was for $611.00 in past due assessments and $225.00 in attorney\u2019s fees for a total amount of $836.00. Petitioner filed the claim of lien against Respondent\u2019s property in Durham County District Court on 15 October 2010.\nOn 5 November 2010, Petitioner\u2019s counsel received a check from Respondent for $611.00. The check, as reflected in the record, bears a handwritten message on the \u201cMEMO\u201d line in the lower left-hand corner of the instrument. Although it is difficult to decipher the handwriting, Respondent asserts in his affidavit that the message reads \u201cfull payment.\u201d However, Brittany Van Zille, the office assistant who processed the check, states in her affidavit that the check \u201cwas not accompanied by any note or correspondence indicating it was for payment in full.\u201d Ms. Van Zille further states that she knows not to process checks designated \u201cpayment in full,\u201d and, even if she had noticed the message, she \u201cwould not have been able to tell that the writing therein indicated that it was for \u2018full payment.\u2019 \u201d\nBank records indicate that Petitioner\u2019s counsel indorsed and processed Respondent\u2019s check on 9 November 2010. That same day, Petitioner commenced foreclosure proceedings by filing a petition and notice of foreclosure hearing in Durham County Superior Court. The petition described Respondent\u2019s debt as comprised of $611.00 in past due assessments, $625.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $180.00 in court costs.\nOn 12 April 2011, a foreclosure hearing based upon foreclosure of the claim of lien was held before the Honorable Archie L. Smith, III, Clerk of Superior Court of Durham County. Respondent\u2014representing himself pro se\u2014asserted that the notation on the check and subsequent processing of the check by Petitioner\u2019s counsel constituted accord and satisfaction, thereby satisfying his debt and precluding foreclosure. The clerk of court disagreed, concluding as a matter of law \u201c[t]hat the tendered check did not constitute accord and satisfaction as it was illegible and insufficient to notify [Petitioner] that it was tendered as payment in full.\u201d The clerk of court authorized Petitioner to proceed with foreclosure and ordered Respondent to pay Petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and court costs totaling $1,680.00. On 27 April 2011, Respondent appealed the clerk of court\u2019s order to Durham County Superior Court pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45-21.16(d1) (2011).\nOn 10 May 2011, Petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment with the trial court. In support of its motion, Petitioner offered the affidavits of Ms. Van Zille and Petitioner\u2019s counsel, an affidavit of debt, a certified claim of lien, and a certified copy of the Declaration. Respondent countered by filing his own motion for summary judgment on 18 May 2011, offering his sworn affidavit in support of the motion.\nIn a summary judgment order entered 24 May 2011, the trial court found, inter alia, that the notation on the check was \u201cillegible,\u201d that there was no evidence of a dispute over the amount of the debt, and that the amount demanded by Petitioner for the debt owed was for a \u201csum certain.\u201d The trial court concluded there had not been accord and satisfaction as a matter of law because: (1) \u201cthe notation on the check was illegible and was therefore insufficient to notify [Petitioner] that it was tendered as payment in full,\u201d (2) \u201cthe debt was neither disputed nor unliquidated,\u201d and (3) \u201cthere was no \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 and no agreement between [Respondent] and [Petitioner] to pay and accept less than the amount claimed.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order authorized Petitioner to proceed with foreclosure of Respondent\u2019s property, and, in addition, ordered Respondent to pay Petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and court costs totaling $5,739.50. The trial court entered an amended order of summary judgment on 2 June 2011. The amended order omits the trial court\u2019s factual findings but is otherwise identical to the original summary judgment order. Respondent timely filed his notice of appeal from the 2 June 2011 order with this Court on 21 June 2011.\nII. Analysis\nChapter 47F of our General Statutes, entitled the \u201cNorth Carolina Planned Community Act,\u201d (\u201cthe Act\u201d) governs the operation of North Carolina homeowners associations such as Petitioner. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 47F-1-102(a) (2011). We note the Act generally applies only to homeowners associations created on or after 1 January 1999, see id., and, according to the Declaration, Petitioner was created on or about 9 December 1975. However, some of the Act\u2019s provisions\u2014and the only provisions relevant to the matter sub judice\u2014apply regardless of the association\u2019s date of inception. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 47F-1-102(c) (2011). Thus, the provisions of the Act cited herein control.\nWith respect to collection of delinquent assessments, the Act provides that \u201c[a]ny assessment levied against a lot remaining unpaid for a period of 30 days or longer shall constitute a lien on that lot when a claim of lien is filed of record in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county in which the lot is located.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 47F-3-116(a) (2011). Moreover, the Act vests the association holding the claim of lien with authority to \u201cforeclose the claim of lien in like manner as a mortgage on real estate under power of sale under Article 2A of Chapter 45 of the General Statutes.\u201d Id.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45-21.16(d) delineates the procedure for a foreclosure hearing held before the clerk of court. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45-21.16(d) (2011). At the hearing, the party seeking foreclosure must establish four statutorily required elements: (1) a valid debt exists and the foreclosing party is the holder of the debt; (2) the debtor has defaulted on the debt; (3) the instrument evidencing the debt permits foreclosure; and (4) proper notice has been afforded to all entitled parties. See id.; In re Adams, _ N.C. App. _, _, 693 S.E.2d 705, 709 (2010). Due to the extra-judicial nature of these proceedings, which are \u201cmeant to \u2018function as a more expeditious and less expensive alternative to a foreclosure by action,\u2019 \u2018foreclosure under [N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45-21.16(d)] is not favored in the law, and its exercise will be watched with jealousy.\u2019 \u201d In re Adams, _ N.C. App. at _, 693 S.E.2d at 708 (citations omitted). The clerk of court\u2019s order authorizing or dismissing foreclosure is appealable to the superior court. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 45-21.16(d)(1) (2011). On appeal, the superior court reviews de novo the same four issues described supra. See id. The superior court\u2019s order authorizing Petitioner to proceed with foreclosure was a final judgment, and, therefore, this Court exercises jurisdiction over Respondent\u2019s appeal pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-27(b) (2011).\nA. Standard of Review\nA motion for summary judgment is appropriately granted where \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2011). The moving party can establish it is entitled to judgment \u201cby proving that an essential element of the opposing party\u2019s claim is nonexistent, or by showing that the opposing party either cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his or her claim or cannot surmount an affirmative defense which would bar the claim.\u201d Sanyo Elec., Inc. v. Albright Distrib. Co., 76 N.C. App. 115, 117, 331 S.E.2d 738, 739 (1985). On appeal, this Court must review the entire record, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Collingwood v. G.E. Real Estate Equities, Inc., 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989).\nIn the instant case, the parties agree there are no issues of material fact and this matter is ripe for summary judgment. Respondent primarily contends the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Petitioner because the check tendered by Respondent and deposited by Petitioner constituted accord and satisfaction as a matter of law. Respondent raises the defense of accord and satisfaction in an attempt to negate the existence of a valid debt, thereby precluding Petitioner\u2019s foreclosure of its claim of lien against Respondent\u2019s property. For the following reasons, we disagree.\nB. Accord and Satisfaction\n\u201cAlthough the existence of accord and satisfaction is generally a question of fact, \u2018where the only reasonable inference is existence or non-existence, accord and satisfaction is a question of law and may be adjudicated by summary judgment when the essential facts are made clear of record.\u2019 \u201d Zanone v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., 120 N.C. App. 768, 771, 463 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1995) (citation omitted). Our Supreme Court has described the common law doctrine of accord and satisfaction as follows:\nAn accord and satisfaction is compounded of the two elements enumerated in the term. \u201cAn \u2018accord\u2019 is an agreement whereby one of the parties undertakes to give or perform, and the other to accept, in satisfaction of a claim, liquidated or in dispute, and arising either from contract or tort, something other than or different from what he is, or considers himself, entitled to; and a \u2018satisfaction\u2019 is the execution, or performance, of such an agreement.\u201d\nDobias v. White, 239 N.C. 409, 413, 80 S.E.2d 23, 27 (1954) (citation omitted). \u201cAgreements are reached by an offer by one party and an acceptance by the other. This is true even though the legal effect of the acceptance may not be understood.\u201d Prentzas v. Prentzas, 260 N.C. 101, 104, 131 S.E.2d 678, 681 (1963).\nRespondent asserts \u201cthe tendering of a check marked full payment is akin to an offer, it is an accord. When the check is accepted, cashed or negotiated, then the offer is accepted by law, the accord becomes an accord and satisfaction\u2014and the matter is closed and resolved.\u201d Respondent misconstrues the doctrine of accord and satisfaction and its applicability to the facts before this Court.\n\u201cWhen there is some indication on a check that it is tendered in full payment of a disputed claim, the cashing of the check is held to be an accord and satisfaction as a matter of law.\u201d Sanyo, 76 N.C. App. at 117, 331 S.E.2d at 740 (emphasis added). However, where there is \u201cno evidence or allegation of communication between plaintiff and defendant concerning a dispute over the account,\u201d nor \u201cevidence or allegation of negotiation or agreement between plaintiff and defendant concerning payment or acceptance of less than the full amount of the account,\u201d the defendant\u2019s notation on a check stating that the check is to be in \u201cfull payment\u201d of the debt owed does not constitute an accord and satisfaction. Fruit & Produce Packaging Co. v. Stepp, 15 N.C. App. 64, 68, 189 S.E.2d 536, 538 (1972). \u201c \u2018The fact that a remittance by check purporting to be \u201cin full\u201d is accepted and used does not result in an accord and satisfaction if the claim involved is liquidated and undisputed ....\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Respondent, it does not establish the existence of a dispute concerning Respondent\u2019s debt. Respondent\u2019s debt, as detailed in Petitioner\u2019s letters, was based upon past due assessments owed by Respondent and the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Petitioner in attempting to collect this debt from Respondent. Respondent did not reply to Petitioner\u2019s letters and gave no indication that he disputed the amount of Petitioner\u2019s claim. Without preface, Respondent \u201cdelivered a check\u201d to Petitioner\u2019s counsel purportedly marked \u201cfull payment.\u201d The check was not accompanied by a letter or other documentation expressing Respondent\u2019s dissatisfaction with the amount of the debt or explaining the meaning of the notation on the check. See Sanyo, 76 N.C. App. at 117-18, 331 S.E.2d at 740 (holding there was accord and satisfaction as a matter of law where debtor tendered full payment check with accompanying letter describing check as delivered \u201c \u2018in full, final and complete settlement of all amounts owed,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[i]n the event you are not agreeable to this check constituting full, final and complete settlement of our account with you, please return this check forthwith\u2019 \u201d). There was no evidence of a discussion at any time between Respondent and Petitioner that Respondent\u2019s check was intended to cover Petitioner\u2019s claim in full. See Snow v. East, 96 N.C. App. 59, 62-63, 384 S.E.2d 689, 691 (1989) (holding no accord and satisfaction because there was no discussion between the parties that a check tendered as payment in full was intended to cover the entire debt owed). Absent some other evidence demonstrating negotiation or a dispute over the amount of the asserted debt, Respondent\u2019s notation on the check\u2019s \u201cMEMO\u201d line was not sufficient to constitute a dispute for purposes of accord and satisfaction. Thus, Petitioner was \u201c \u2018justified in treating the transaction as merely the act of an honest debtor remitting less than is due under a mistake as to the nature of the contract.\u2019 \u201d Fruit & Produce Packaging Co., 15 N.C. App. at 68, 189 S.E.2d at 538 (citation omitted).\nFurthermore, Respondent\u2019s reliance on Barber v. White, 46 N.C. App. 110, 264 S.E.2d 385 (1980) is misplaced. In Barber, the plaintiff entered into an agreement to paint the defendants house at an estimated cost of $2,700.00. Id. at 111, 264 S.E.2d at 385. The plaintiff completed the work and presented the defendants with \u201ca bill for $2,359.19, which defendants contested as too high.\" Id. (emphasis added). The defendants tendered a check to the plaintiff marked \u201cpainting in full\u201d for $1,813.19. Id. The plaintiff cashed the check and then demanded the balanced owed by the defendants. Id. This Court held that the \u201cPlaintiffs cashing of the check marked \u2018painting in full\u2019 established an accord and satisfaction as a matter of law.\u201d Id. at 113, 264 S.E.2d at 386.\nUnlike the defendants in Barber, Respondent did not attempt to negotiate or contest the amount of his debt. He simply dropped off an envelope with an enclosed check for an amount less than the amount due. Barber stands for the principle that cashing a check settles a disputed debt, and, as Respondent has failed to offer any evidence of a dispute, we find that case inapplicable to the case at bar.\nWe note the common law doctrine of accord and satisfaction has been codified in section 25-3-311 of our General Statutes as part of North Carolina\u2019s adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 25-3-311 (2011). However, section 25-3-311 applies only where the amount of the claim is \u201cunliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute.\u201d See id. This Court has interpreted this requirement to mean that \u201cthe \u2018person against whom a claim is asserted\u2019 must prove, inter alia, that \u2018the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute\u2019 prior to submission of the instrument representing full and final payment. Hunter-McDonald, Inc. v. Edison Foard, Inc., 157 N.C. App. 560, 563, 579 S.E.2d 490, 492 (2003) (emphasis added); see also Futrelle v. Duke Univ., 127 N.C. App. 244, 249-50, 488 S.E.2d 635, 639 (1997) (\u201cThe requirement, that a dispute exist, is satisfied in that, prior to payment. . . the parties disputed what remedy, if any, plaintiff was entitled to receive.\u201d (emphasis added)). \u201cIt is not enough for defendant to demonstrate the parties presently disagree as to the amount due, but rather defendant must prove \u2018the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute[.]\u2019 \u201d Hunter-McDonald, Inc., 157 N.C. App. at 563, 579 S.E.2d at 492 (citation omitted) (alteration in original).\nAs discussed supra, Respondent failed to introduce evidence demonstrating the existence of a dispute at any time prior to tendering the check to Petitioner. This fact alone renders N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 25-3-311 inapplicable to Respondent\u2019s accord and satisfaction defense; our common law analysis, supra, is dispositive. Respondent\u2019s remaining contentions on this issue are without merit. We hold that Respondent failed to establish accord and satisfaction as a mat ter of law, and the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Petitioner.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s order is\nAffirmed.\nJudges STEELMAN and GEER concur.\n. It is unclear from the record whether Petitioner\u2019s counsel submitted the petition and notice of foreclosure hearing to the trial court prior to its receipt of Respondent\u2019s check.", "author": "HUNTER, JR., Robert N., Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["IN THE MATTER OF THE FORECLOSURE OF A LIEN BY Five Oaks Recreational Association, Inc., a North Carolina Corporation against, Martin J.

Morrow, sent notices of violation to Petitioners George Beaman, Benjamin Edwards, and Lynn Owens (\u201cPetitioners\u201d), the owners of Club 519, 5th Street Distillery, Mac Billiards, and Live (the \u201cestablishments\u201d), citing the establishments\u2019 violation of North Carolina\u2019s smoking ban, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-491, et seq., and advising the owners that they would be subject to \u201can ongoing administrative penalty of $200 per day\u201d if the violations continued beyond their third notice of violation. Petitioners appealed the citations and administrative penalties to the Pitt County Board of Health (the \u201cBoard of Health\u201d), which upheld the penalties after hearing each appeal. Thereafter, Petitioners petitioned Pitt County District Court for judicial review of the decision of the Board of Health, contending, inter alia, that the Board of Health\u2019s enforcement of the North Carolina smoking ban\u2014specifically enforcement of sections 130A-492(11) and 130A-496(b)(3), which Petitioners allege exempt all country clubs from the ban, but do not exempt the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d establishments\u2014violates Petitioners\u2019 constitutional rights to equal protection of the laws. Following a hearing in Pitt County District Court, the Honorable G. Galen Braddy presiding, the trial court entered an order in which it concluded that sections 130A-492(11) and 130A-496(b)(3), as applied to the Petitioners, \u201care in violation of the Equal Protection Clauses of both the United States and the North Carolina Constitutions and are therefore unconstitutional and unenforceable against Petitioners only.\u201d From this order, Respondent appeals, arguing that the trial court erroneously concluded that the challenged portions of the North Carolina smoking ban irrationally distinguish the establishments from country clubs and unconstitutionally subject the former to restrictions while exempting the latter. For the following reasons, we agree with Respondent.\nWhile generally prohibiting smoking \u201cin all enclosed areas of restaurants and bars,\u201d section 130A-496 of the smoking ban provides that \u201c[s]moking may be permitted in . . . [a] private club.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-496 (2011). Section 130A-492(11) defines a \u201cprivate club\u201d as follows:\nA country club or an organization that [(1)] maintains selective members, [(2)] is operated by the membership, [(3)] does not provide food or lodging for pay to anyone who is not a member or a member\u2019s guest, and [(4)] is either [(a)] incorporated as a nonprofit corporation in accordance with Chapter 55A of the General Statutes or [(b)] is exempt from federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code as defined in [section] 105-130.2(1). For the purposes of this Article, private club includes country club.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-492(11) (2011). Petitioners contend, and we agree, that the above statutory definition, read as a whole and interpreted to avoid superfluity, creates two distinct types of private clubs that are exempt from the smoking ban: (1) country clubs, and (2) non-country club organizations meeting the four listed qualifications. The second sentence of the statutory definition, which specifically states that \u201cprivate club includes country club,\u201d belies the argument advanced by Respondent that the four listed qualifications must be met by a country club before that country club can be considered a private club exempted from the smoking ban. Rather, the second sentence\u2019s unequivocal inclusion of country clubs in the private club exemption dictates the conclusion that, while a non-country club organization seeking exemption as a private club must meet the four listed qualifications, a country club need only be a country club in order to be exempted as a private club.\nThe question raised by Petitioners before the trial court, and the issue before this Court on appeal, is whether exempting country clubs from the smoking ban, but not the establishments, is unconstitutional. Petitioners contend that this distinction is irrational, and thus, unconstitutional. See Heritage Vill. Church & Missionary Fellowship, Inc. v. State, 40 N.C. App. 429, 447-48, 253 S.E.2d 473, 484 (1979) (holding that statutory exemptions that make \u201can arbitrary and irrational distinction unrelated to the purposes of the statute\u201d are \u201cviolative of the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution and of the North Carolina Constitution\u201d), aff\u2019d, 299 N.C. 399, 263 S.E.2d 726 (1980). They support this contention by highlighting the fact that, because section 130A-492(11) exempts all country clubs, for-profit country clubs are exempt while for-profit non-country club organizations are not. To address Petitioners\u2019 constitu tional claim, we must first determine whether a for-profit country club is, in fact, exempt from the smoking ban. Or, \u201cWhen is a country club not a country club?\u201d\nWhere statutory language is clear and unambiguous, our Courts do not \u201cengage in judicial construction but must apply the statute to give effect to the plain and definite meaning of the language.\u201d Fowler v. Valencourt, 334 N.C. 345, 348, 435 S.E.2d 530, 532 (1993). \u201cThe plain meaning of words may be construed by reference to standard, nonlegal dictionaries.\u201d State v. Webb, 358 N.C. 92, 97, 591 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, however, dictionaries offer no clear, unambiguous definition of the term \u201ccountry club.\u201d See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 521 (2002) (defining \u201ccountry club\u201d as \u201can upper-class suburban or outlying club or clubhouse for social life, golf, and other recreation\u201d); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 463 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201c[A] club, usually in a suburban district, with a clubhouse and grounds, offering various social activities and generally having facilities for tennis, golf, swimming, etc.\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary 463 (4th ed. 2000) (\u201cA suburban club for social and sports activities, usually featuring a golf course\u201d). Indeed, the dictionary entries seem to agree only that country clubs usually are suburban and feature social and recreational activities; any other characteristics are not universally applicable. We further note that (1) our General Statutes contain no definition of the term, and (2) the statutory codes of other jurisdictions, like the dictionary entries, are not in agreement as to what precisely constitutes a country club. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.013(5) (2011) (for exemption from certain consumer protection requirements, a country club (1) must \u201cha[ve] as its primary function the provision of a social life and recreational amenities to its members, and for which a program of physical exercise is merely incidental to membership\u201d; and (2) is defined as \u201ca facility that offers its members a variety of services that may include, but need not be limited to, social activities; dining, banquet, catering, and lounge facilities; swimming; yachting; golf; tennis; card games such as bridge and canasta; and special programs for members\u2019 children\u201d); Md. Code Ann., Alcoholic Beverages \u00a7 6-301(6)(iii) (2011) (for purpose of issuance of alcohol licenses, a \u201cgolf and country club\u201d must have \u201c200 or more bona fide members paying dues of not less than $75 per annum per member\u201d and must \u201cmaintain[] . . . two or more tennis courts, a swimming pool at least 30 feet by 80 feet in size, and a regular or championship golf course of nine holes or more\u201d). We con- elude, therefore, that the undefined term \u201ccountry club,\u201d as used in the statute, is ambiguous and unclear. As such, we must interpret that ambiguous statutory language \u201cto give effect to the legislative intent\u201d and avoid \u201c[a] construction of [the] statute which operates to defeat or impair the object of the statute.\u201d N. C. Baptist Hosps., Inc. v. Mitchell, 323 N.C. 528, 532, 374 S.E.2d 844, 846 (1988) (citation omitted).\nAs specified in section 130A-491, titled \u201cLegislative findings and intent\u201d:\nIt is the intent of the General Assembly to protect the health of individuals in public places . . . from the risks related to secondhand smoke.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-491(b) (2011). The fact that the legislature\u2019s stated intent is to protect individuals in public places from the dangers of secondhand smoke, along with the fact that the language allowing smoking in country clubs is situated in the subsection defining \u201cprivate club,\u201d is a clear indication that an interpretation of \u201ccountry club\u201d that \u201cgive[s] effect to the legislative intent\u201d of the statutes would be one that only exempts private country clubs from the smoking ban. Conversely, an interpretation that allows smoking in public country clubs would, without question, \u201cdefeat or impair the object of the statute.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the legislature\u2019s exemption of country clubs from the smoking ban applies only to private country clubs and does not exclude public country clubs. The question, then, becomes, \u201cWhen is a country club a private country club?\u201d\nAs noted in this Court\u2019s recent decision in Liebes, courts have looked at various factors to determine when a club is private rather than public. _ N.C. App. at _, 713 S.E.2d at 555 (citing the \u201cmulti-factor framework set forth in United States v. Lansdowne Swim Club, 713 F. Supp. 785 (E.D. Pa. 1989)\u201d and various cases applying that analysis). Our legislature, too, considers several elements as determinative of private status and, indeed, has yet to settle on a single set of factors to make that determination, applicable in all instances. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 18B-1000(5) (2011) (defining a \u201cprivate club\u201d as \u201c[a]n establishment that is organized and operated solely for a social, recreational, patriotic, or fraternal purpose and that is not open to the general public, but is open only to the members of the organization and their bona fide guests\u201d). But see N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-247(2) (2011) (\u201c \u2018Private club\u2019 means an organization that maintains selective members, is operated by the membership, does not provide food or lodging for pay to anyone who is not a member or a member\u2019s guest, and is either incorporated as a nonprofit corporation in accordance with Chapter 55A of the General Statutes or is exempt from federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code as defined in [section] 105-130.2(1).\u201d). The foregoing authority, establishing that there is no bright-line rule for distinguishing private clubs from non-private clubs, indicates that there is, likewise, no clear answer to the question of when a country club is a private country club. Our task, then, in interpreting the legislature\u2019s ambiguous exemption of private country clubs from the smoking ban, is to answer that question in a way that best effectuates the legislature\u2019s intent and does not operate to impair the object of the statute. See Willoughby v. Bd. of Trs. of Teachers\u2019 & State Emps. Ret. Sys., 121 N.C. App. 444, 449, 466 S.E.2d 285, 289 (1996) (construing statute \u201cso as to best effectuate the stated [] goal\u201d of the statute); H.B.S. Contractors, Inc. v. Cumberland Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 122 N.C. App. 49, 55, 468 S.E.2d 517, 522 (1996) (pursuing the \u201cparamount objective in statutory interpretation\u201d of \u201cgiv[ing] effect to the legislative intent\u201d by choosing the interpretation that \u201cbest effectuates the legislative intent\u201d). To that end, and for the following reasons, we conclude that the legislature\u2019s exemption of private country clubs applies only to nonprofit country clubs and does not, as Petitioners suggest, exempt for-profit country clubs.\nInitially, we note that the vast weight of authority uses nonprofit status as a factor weighing in favor of\u2014or as a requisite for\u2014a determination that a club is truly private. See, e.g., Welsh v. Boy Scouts of America, 993 F.2d 1267, 1277 (7th Cir. 1993) (holding that a club\u2019s nonprofit status supports the conclusion that the club is private); Lansdowne Swim Club, 713 F. Supp. at 804 (holding that a club\u2019s nonprofit status \u201csupports] its claim that it is a private club\u201d); N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-247(2) (private club must be nonprofit).\nBeyond regularly serving as a requisite for private status in legal analysis, nonprofit status, in and of itself, presumptively ensures that a country club is truly, rather than nominally, a private club. From an economics standpoint, it is considered a given that the primary aim of a for-profit entity is profit maximization. See, e.g., James F. McDonough III, Comment, The Myth of the Patent Troll: An Alternative View of the Function of Patent Dealers in an Idea Economy, 56 Emory L.J. 189, 208 (2006) (noting that \u201cthe overriding motive of a for-profit firm is to maximize profits\u201d (citing R.H. Coase, The Nature of the Firm, 4 Economica 386, 390-92 (1937))); Srikanth Srinivasan, Note, College Financial Aid and Antitrust: Applying the Sherman Act to Collaberative Nonprofit Activity, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 919, 932 (1994) (\u201cMicroeconomic theory assumes that commercial firms pursue one objective\u2014profit-maximization.\u201d (citing Robert S. Pindyck & Daniel L. Rubinfeld, Microeconomics 4 (2d ed. 1992))). In pursuit of that goal, a for-profit country club\u2019s owners will make decisions for the club\u2014such as the requirements for membership, the size of membership, whether to allow a new member, and whether to allow smoking-\u2014based primarily, if not singularly, on which option maximizes the country club\u2019s profit. Cf. Nina J. Crimm, An Explanation of the Federal Income Tax Exemption for Charitable Organizations: A Theory of Risk Compensation, 50 Fla. L. Rev. 419, 446-47 (1998) (\u201cIn the for-profit setting, the shareholders\u2019 primary concern is to maximize their profits and, because the board and management are accountable to the shareholders, a major objective is to satisfy the shareholders\u2019 goal. This pressure will theoretically cause decision-makers of for-profit entities to attempt to maximize profits . . . .\u201d). The necessary results of such profit-driven decision-making will be minimal membership requirements (a non-exclusionary membership fee), expanded membership (open to anyone willing to pay the fee), and, ultimately, a near-publicly accessible country club (at least for anyone who can afford the fee). Contrasted with a nonprofit private country club\u2014whose ownership and membership decisions are not based on profit maximization, but rather on furtherance of the private social and recreational purposes for which the club was established\u2014the for-profit club is far less likely to exhibit those characteristics associated with truly private organizations, i.e., more selective membership and operation by members for membership rather than by owner for profit. Accordingly, an interpretation of \u201ccountry club\u201d that allows smoking in only those truly private, nonprofit country clubs and that bans smoking in quasi-public, for-profit country clubs best effectuates the legislature\u2019s intent to protect the health of individuals in public places.\nFurther, as evidenced by the legislature\u2019s creation of a private club exception in the first place, it is clear that the legislature, while attempting to protect individuals in public places, also sought to limit the impact of the smoking ban on the rights of association of members of organizations that are truly private. Cf. Coastal Ready-Mix Concrete Co. v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs of Town of Nags Head, 299 N.C. 620, 629, 265 S.E.2d 379, 385 (1980) (holding that legislative intent may be shown by \u201cthe language of the statute or ordinance\u201d and \u201cwhat the act seeks to accomplish\u201d).. In our view, interpreting the country club exemption to apply only to nonprofit private country clubs effectuates this intent by allowing smoking in clubs that are established and operated in the furtherance of a private, social or recreational purpose, while protecting from the risks of secondhand smoke citizens patronizing those organizations that are nominally private, but allow nearly unrestricted public access.\nIt is also notable that the legislative history of the statute reveals that the legislature\u2019s initial definition of \u201cprivate club\u201d in the proposed bill was nearly identical to the definition of private club in section 18B-1000(5), the main difference being an additional nonprofit requirement not found in section 18B-1000(5). See Act of May 19, 2009, ch. 27, 2009 N.C. Sess. Laws 39 (private club exception first introduced in the fourth edition of House Bill 2); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 18B-1000(5). We find it significant that, presented with two differing statutory definitions of \u201cprivate club\u201d\u2014one definition with a nonprofit requirement, one without, compare N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 18B-1000(5), with N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-247(2)\u2014and cognizant of those differing definitions, Williams v. Alexander Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 128 N.C. App. 599, 603, 495 S.E.2d 406, 408 (1998) (\u201cIn ascertaining the intent of the legislature, the presumption is that it acted with full knowledge of prior and existing laws.\u201d), the legislature chose to model the statutory definition in the smoking ban after the private club definition that did not contain a nonprofit requirement, yet added to that definition a requirement that the club must be nonprofit. Clearly, then, the drafters of the smoking ban\u2019s private club exception intended that all clubs qualifying under that exception would be nonprofit clubs. Accordingly, we conclude that an interpretation that accomplishes just that result best effectuates the legislature\u2019s intent, as shown by the wording and legislative history of the statute.\nBecause we conclude that only private, nonprofit country clubs are exempt under the private club exemption, to address Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claim we need not determine the constitutionality of exempting for-profit country clubs and not for-profit non-country club organizations. Rather, we need only determine the constitutionality of the smoking ban\u2019s exemption of private, nonprofit country clubs, but not the establishments.\nAssuming that the establishments, which are private and for-profit, are similarly situated with private, nonprofit country clubs with respect to the smoking ban\u2019s statutory scheme, the question is whether the legislature could have had a plausible, rational reason for allowing smoking in private, nonprofit country clubs, but disallowing smoking in private, for-profit noncountry clubs. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., 358 N.C. 160, 180-81, 594 S.E.2d 1, 15 (2004) (holding that rational basis review is satisfied \u201cso long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification . . . and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational\u201d) (quoting Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 11, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1, 13 (1992)). And the answer, as it was in Liebes, is \u201cyes.\u201d. _ N.C. App. at _, 713 S.E.2d at 553-55. In Liebes, this Court noted several plausible reasons why our legislature would exempt nonprofit non-country club organizations, but not for-profit non-country club organizations, such as the potential impairment of the legislative intent accompanying a broader definition of \u201cprivate club\u201d and more objective enforcement resulting from the ready discernibility of nonprofit status. Id. Those same reasons justify the legislature\u2019s exemption of only nonprofit country clubs and not for-profit non-country club organizations such as the establishments. Accordingly, we conclude that the smoking ban\u2019s private club exception does not irrationally classify the establishments, and that the Board of Health\u2019s enforcement of the North Carolina smoking ban against Petitioners does not violate Petitioners\u2019 constitutional right to equal protection. Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in declaring the challenged section of the North Carolina smoking ban unconstitutional. The decision of the trial court is\nREVERSED.\nJudge STROUD concurs.\nJudge BEASLEY concurs in separate opinion.\n. See State v. Coffey, 336 N.C. 412, 417-18, 444 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1994) (citations omitted) (stating that (I) our courts construe each word of a statute to have meaning because it is always presumed that the legislature acted with care and deliberation, and (2) a statute should not be interpreted in a manner which would render any of its words superfluous).\n.

Defendant primarily contends on appeal that the trial court committed plain error in admitting evidence that defendant had previously been in jail and that he associated with \u201cdrug boys.\u201d As defendant has not demonstrated that the jury probably would have reached a different verdict in the absence of that evidence, he has not established plain error.\nFacts\nThe State\u2019s evidence tended to show the following facts. Johnny Barnes was a resident of Eastgate Apartments, as was defendant. Barnes knew defendant by his nickname, which sounded something like \u201cDalp.\u201d On 5 October 2009, Barnes sold his coat to his friend Charlie to get money to do his laundry. After finishing his laundry, Barnes went to look for Charlie because he had received only part of the money for the coat. Barnes found Charlie at defendant\u2019s apartment and was talking to him when defendant came to the door in what Barnes described as a rage.\nDefendant told Barnes that he should not \u201cbe knocking on my door looking for nobody about no damn money.\u201d Barnes indicated to defendant that he did not want any trouble and then began walking back towards his apartment with Charlie. Barnes heard defendant \u201ccussing,\u201d and defendant continued \u201cin a rage.\u201d A moment later, someone told Barnes to turn around. As he turned, defendant stabbed him in the shoulder with a knife. Barnes collapsed about 30 feet from defendant\u2019s apartment and called an ambulance. He was taken to the hospital where he stayed for a week and a half.\nOfficer Kyle Wilson of the Winston-Salem Police Department was called out to investigate the incident. When Officer Wilson arrived on the scene, he found Barnes holding his side and bleeding from his chest. Although Barnes could only identify the person who stabbed him as \u201cDap,\u201d he identified defendant\u2019s apartment building as being where his assailant lived. Another officer who arrived later found blood in front of that building.\nAfter speaking with Barnes, Officer Wilson went into defendant\u2019s apartment where he saw a steak knife by the kitchen sink that was wet. Officer Wilson subsequently spoke with Barnes at the hospital where he described his assailant as a black male with a heavy beard and mustache who had recently been in jail. Having canvassed the neighborhood and spoken with Barnes\u2019 friend Charlie, Officer Wilson obtained a warrant and arrested defendant.\nDefendant was indicted for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury (\u201cAWDWIKISI\u201d) and for being a habitual felon. The jury convicted him, however, of AWDWISI and of being a habitual felon. The trial court sentenced defendant to a presumptive-range term of 95 to 123 months imprisonment. Defendant timely appealed to this Court.\nI\nDefendant first argues that the trial court committed plain error in admitting testimony (1) that defendant had been incarcerated in the past and (2) that he associated with people involved with drugs. The testimony regarding defendant\u2019s prior incarceration came from both Barnes and Officer Wilson. During the cross-examination of Barnes, defendant\u2019s counsel elicited the following testimony:\nQ. Is that what you told the police officer?\nA. Told him what? I didn\u2019t know his real name. I went by the name as they called him.\nQ. Dop?\nA. Dalp [phonetic] or something. He\u2019ll tell you.\nQ. So it\u2019s Dalp?\nA. That\u2019s Kinard. But they called him something else down there. Because I was living down there, and he came like from just getting out of prison. I didn\u2019t know his full name.\nDefendant made no objection or motion to strike with respect to this testimony.\nSubsequently, during direct examination, Officer Wilson testified that Barnes \u201cadvised that he believed that the suspect had recently been in jail.\u201d At that point, defendant objected, but the trial court overruled the objection. Defendant concedes that his objection to Officer Wilson\u2019s answer was not sufficient to preserve the objection to the admission of the evidence that defendant had previously been in jail given his failure to object during Barnes\u2019 testimony. See State v. Whitley, 311 N.C. 656, 661, 319 S.E.2d 584, 588 (1984) (\u201c[T]he defend-ant waived his right to raise on appeal his objection to the evidence. Where evidence is admitted over objection, and the same evidence has been previously admitted or is later admitted without objection, the benefit of the objection is lost.\u201d).\nConsequently, defendant argues that the admission of the testimony about his incarceration constituted plain error. It is well established that \u201c \u2018[t]he plain error rule applies only in truly exceptional cases. Before deciding that an error by the trial court amounts to \u201cplain error,\u201d the appellate court must be convinced that absent the error the jury probably would have reached a different verdict. In other words, the appellate court must determine that the error in question \u201ctilted the scales\u201d and caused the jury to reach its verdict convicting the defendant.\u2019 \u201d State v. Duke, 360 N.C. 110, 138-39, 623 S.E.2d 11, 29-30 (2005) (internal citation omitted) (quoting State v. Walker, 316 N.C. 33, 39, 340 S.E.2d 80, 83 (1986)).\nIn this case, even assuming without deciding, that the admission of the above testimony was error, defendant has failed to demonstrate that the admission of this evidence caused the jury to reach its verdict. \u201cThe elements of AWDWISI are: (1) an assault, (2) with a deadly weapon, (3) inflicting serious injury, (4) not resulting in death.\u201d State v. Jones, 353 N.C. 159, 164, 538 S.E.2d 917, 922 (2000). The State presented ample evidence of each element and that defendant was the perpetrator.\nDefendant asserts that the evidence against defendant was \u201cweak\u201d because the State did not corroborate Barnes\u2019 testimony with the testimony of Charlie and did not present the knife defendant allegedly used. Based on our review of the record, we find it highly unlikely that the jury would have rejected Barnes\u2019 testimony that defendant stabbed him.\nImmediately after being stabbed and while awaiting transport to the hospital, Barnes identified defendant as his assailant by nickname and pointed to defendant\u2019s apartment building as where his assailant lived. Officer Wilson found blood on the front step of that building and a wet steak knife next to defendant\u2019s kitchen sink, suggesting it had just been washed. Barnes then specifically identified defendant at trial as the perpetrator. In the face of this evidence, defendant presents no explanation on appeal why a jury would find Barnes\u2019 identification of defendant less credible in the absence of the testimony about defendant\u2019s prior incarceration.\nDefendant also appears to argue that because the State did not present testimony from a health care provider regarding Barnes\u2019 injury, the evidence of the seriousness of that injury was sufficiently weak that evidence of defendant\u2019s prior incarceration must have tipped the scales towards conviction. Given that Barnes was stabbed, both Officer Wilson and Barnes testified that Barnes was bleeding profusely, Barnes was hospitalized for more than a week, and Barnes required a breathing tube, we do not believe that defendant has shown that in the absence of the challenged testimony, the jury would have concluded that the injury was not serious. Defendant has, therefore, failed to show plain error regarding the admission of Barnes\u2019 statement that defendant had previously been in prison.\nSecond, defendant argues Barnes\u2019 testimony suggesting that defendant consorted with people involved with drugs constituted plain error. During Barnes\u2019 cross-examination, the following exchange took place:\nQ. [Charlie] wasn\u2019t at his uncle ... in Apartment B?\nA. Not at the time. That\u2019s where he lives. That\u2019s where he was living at. . . one time. But at the house where I went to, that\u2019s where all the drug boys hung out at because\u2014\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Judge. No question\u2019s before the witness.\nA. That\u2019s what they did.\nTHE COURT: Overruled*\nQ. You\u2019re saying you did drugs over there?\nA. No. I\u2019m saying that\u2019s where they did their drugs at.\nWe do not believe, given the State\u2019s evidence, that this testimony was any more likely to tip the scales for conviction than the testimony regarding defendant\u2019s prior incarceration. Consequently, defendant has also failed to establish that the admission of this testimony amounted to plain error.\nII\nDefendant next contends that the trial court committed plain error during the habitual felon phase of his trial in admitting evidence not only of the judgment and charging documents for defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions, but also the plea transcripts for those convictions. Defendant points out that those plea transcripts showed (1) that defendant had been given lenient sentences under prior plea agreements, (2) that he was ordered to undergo mental health counseling, and (3) that he had been intoxicated in the past\u2014information irrelevant to whether he was convicted of the offenses set out in the habitual felon indictment.\nDefendant contends that admission of his plea transcripts violated N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1025 (2011), which provides that \u201c[t]he fact that the defendant or his counsel and the prosecutor engaged in plea discussions or made a plea arrangement may not be received in evidence against or in favor of the defendant in any criminal or civil action or administrative proceedings.\u201d Because defendant did not object to the admission of the plea transcripts, he is limited to plain error review.\nWe agree with defendant that, at a minimum, this Court\u2019s opinion in State v. Ross, 207 N.C. App. 379, 700 S.E.2d 412 (2010), disc. review denied, 365 N.C. 346, 717 S.E.2d 377 (2011), establishes that it was error to admit plea transcripts that had not been redacted to remove information not relevant to the habitual felon proceeding, such as defendant\u2019s prior drug use, mental health counseling, and lenient sentencing. Nevertheless, this Court in Ross concluded that even though the defendant had preserved the issue for review, he did not show sufficient prejudice to warrant a new habitual felon hearing. Id. at 400, 700 S.E.2d at 426.\nThe Court pointed out that the defendant did not dispute that he had been previously convicted of the three felonies required for the jury to find he had attained habitual felon status. Id. 700 S.E.2d at 425-26. As a result, the Court held that \u201c[g]iven the overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence of the three felony convictions, there [was] essentially no likelihood\u201d that the jury would have reached a different result. Id. 700 S.E.2d at 426. See also State v. Stitt, 147 N.C. App. 77, 84-85, 553 S.E.2d 703, 708-09 (2001) (holding defend- ant had failed to prove prejudice as to admission of transcripts of plea to prove habitual felon status, particularly given their admission only during the habitual sentencing phase of defendant\u2019s trial where the only issue was whether he had been convicted of the underlying felonies).\nIn this case, although defendant did argue below that the exhibits were not self-authenticating, he did not dispute the fact that he had been convicted of the necessary predicate felonies. In addition, the State presented evidence of those convictions in the form of the information, warrant, transcript of plea, and judgment for each of the three felonies. Since the only issue in a habitual felon proceeding is whether the defendant has been convicted of or pled guilty to three felony offenses, Ross, 207 N.C. App. at 399, 700 S.E.2d at 425, we believe, just as this Court did in Ross, that there is essentially no likelihood that the jury would have reached any other verdict had the plea transcripts been excluded.\nIII\nFinally, defendant contends that he was denied a \u201cfair sentencing hearing because the trial court improperly considered the seriousness of the assault offense and gave too much weight to his criminal record before sentencing him.\u201d During the sentencing hearing, the parties argued regarding the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions. Defendant was willing to stipulate only to two convictions of possession of drug paraphernalia and contended that he was a prior record level two.\nThe trial court then determined that seven misdemeanor convictions should be included in calculating defendant\u2019s prior record level. After hearing further argument by counsel, the trial court announced:\nTHE COURT: I\u2019ll try to take into account all the things argued by counsel, by the state, the seriousness of the current offense, his voluminous criminal history and record of a lot of misdemeanors. I\u2019ll also try to take into account what you said, the nature of the prior felonies that got him to this status of habitual felon, and the passage of time since his previous felony, and the things about Disability.\nAnd the Court considering all these things, Madam Clerk, again will find that he was convicted by the Jury of the Class E assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. The Court will enhance it to a Class C pursuant to the habitual felon status, prior record level 3; the Court having found seven prior record level points due to seven prior A-l or 1 misdemeanors.\nThe trial court then sentenced defendant to a presumptive-range term of 95 to 123 months imprisonment.\nAlthough a sentence within the statutory limits will be presumed regular and valid, such a presumption is not conclusive. State v. Boone, 293 N.C. 702, 712, 239 S.E.2d 459, 465 (1977). \u201cIf the record discloses that the [trial] court considered irrelevant and improper matter in determining the severity of the sentence, the presumption of regularity is overcome, and the sentence is in violation of [the] defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d Id. In Boone, our Supreme Court ordered a new sentencing hearing when the trial court improperly considered in sentencing the defendant\u2019s decision to reject a plea offer because the defendant \u201chad the right to plead not guilty, and he should not and cannot be punished for exercising that right.\u201d Id. at 712-13, 239 S.E.2d at 465.\nHere, defendant cites no authority\u2014and we know of none\u2014suggesting that a trial court may not take into account the seriousness of a crime and the defendant\u2019s criminal record in deciding where within a presumptive range a defendant\u2019s sentence should fall. The cases cited by defendant\u2014State v. Higson, 310 N.C. 418, 312 S.E.2d 437 (1984); State v. Blackwelder, 309 N.C. 410, 306 S.E.2d 783 (1983); State v. Chatman, 308 N.C. 169, 301 S.E.2d 71 (1983); and State v. Benfield, 67 N.C. App. 490, 313 S.E.2d 198 (1984)\u2014all address the finding of an aggravating factor to increase the sentence beyond the presumptive range. They do not address what is at issue in this case: whether a trial court may consider the seriousness of the crime and the defendant\u2019s record in deciding where, within the presumptive range, a defendant\u2019s sentence should fall.\nThe imposition of the minimum sentence under the sentencing guidelines is within the discretion of the trial court. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c)(2) (2011) (emphasis added) provides that for the presumptive range, when \u201cthe sentence of imprisonment is neither aggravated or mitigated,\u201d then \u201cany minimum term of imprisonment in that range is permitted ....\u201d See also State v. Parker, 143 N.C. App. 680, 685-86, 550 S.E.2d 174, 177 (2001) (\u201cThe Structured Sentencing Act clearly provides for judicial discretion in allowing the trial court to choose a minimum sentence within a specified range.\u201d). If a trial court is free to choose \u201cany\u201d minimum term, we fail to see why a trial court should not be able to take into account the seriousness of the particular offense when exercising its discretion to decide which minimum term within the presumptive range for that class of offense and prior record level to impose.\nNo error.\nChief Judge MARTIN and Judge STROUD concur.\n. Ross does not specifically address whether the plea transcripts should have been excluded under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1025, and we do not address that issue here.", "author": "GEER, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v. KINARD JULIUS OAKES"]}}}

For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.\nI. Background\nOn 19 April 2010, plaintiff filed a verified complaint alleging that defendant owned a \u201cDwelling\u201d that \u201c[s]ince at least October 6, 2008 ... has been damaged to such an extent that the condition of the Dwelling was unsafe for human habitation causing the Dwelling to be condemned by the Town\u2019s building inspector^ ]\u201d Plaintiff further alleged:\nThe Town\u2019s Manager inspected the Dwelling . . . and determined at the time of his inspection:\na. That the Dwelling was in a deteriorated and damaged condition;\nb. That the Dwelling was disconnected from utilities;\nc. That the Dwelling was disconnected from approved means of sewage disposal;\nd. That components of the Dwelling\u2019s on-site sewage disposal system were visibly damaged or missing;\ne. That the Dwelling was located in its entirety on the wet sand beach as evidenced by the high tide swash line and tidal pools located westward of the Dwelling;\nf. That the Dwelling restricted vehicle access along the public trust beach area;\ng. That the Dwelling restricted pedestrian access along the public trust beach area;\nh. That the Dwelling had incurred storm and/or erosion damage;\ni. That the Dwelling was located wholly or partially on land subject to the public trust and within the public trust beach area; and\nj. That there did not appear to be an opportunity for relocation of the Dwelling on its lot in a manner complying with relevant federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nPlaintiff further alleged that \u201c[a]t all times subsequent to the Town Manager\u2019s inspection, the condition of the Dwelling has remained the same or has deteriorated due to weather, lack of use, lack of repair and damage caused by erosion, coastal storms, hurricanes and tropical storms.\u201d The Town Manager \u201cdeclared the Dwelling to be a public nuisance . . . and provided Defendant eighteen (18) days to abate the nuisance by demolishing and/or removing the Dwelling.\u201d Plaintiff requested, inter alia,\n[a]n order of abatement.. . commanding Defendant[] to immediately, and at [its] sole expense, bring the Property in compliance with all applicable regulations and laws by demolishing, repairing or otherwise taking corrective action regarding the Dwelling ... or commanding the Defendant]] to immediately allow the Town to enter upon the Property and take such action at the Defendants\u2019 sole expense.\nOn 7 July 2010, defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), answered plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and counterclaimed for inverse condemnation. On 26 July 2010, plaintiff filed motions to dismiss defendant\u2019s counterclaim. On 8 October 2010, defendant voluntarily dismissed its counterclaim. On or about 15 October 2010, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. On 29 November 2010, plaintiff filed an amended/renewed motion for summary judgment.\nOn 6 December 2010, the trial court heard defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss and plaintiff\u2019s motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff provided two separate bases for declaring defendant\u2019s Dwelling a nuisance predicated upon Town of Nags Head Code of Ordinances (\u201cTown Ordinance\u201d) \u00a7 16-31C6): (1) \u201cwhen there is a damaged structure or debris from [a] damage [d] structure where it can reasonably be determined that there is a likelihood of personal or property injury\u201d and (2) \u201cany structure regardless of the condition\u2014it can be a brand new structure or any debris from a damaged structure which is located in whole or in part in a public trust area or on public land[.]\u201d Town Ordinance \u00a7 16-31(6) provides in pertinent part,\nThe existence of any of the following conditions associated with storm-damaged or erosion\u2014amaged structures or their resultant debris shall constitute a public nuisance.\nb. Damaged structure or debris from damaged structures where it can reasonably be determined that there is a likelihood of personal or property injury;\nc. Any structure, regardless of condition, or any debris from damaged structure which is located in whole or in part in a public trust area or public land.\nTown of Nags Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-31(6) (2007). Town Ordinance \u00a7 16-33 further provides that \u201c[u]pon a determination that conditions constituting a public nuisance exist, the town manager ... shall order the prompt abatement thereof . . . .\u201d Town of Nags Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-33(a) (2007). \u201cAbatement of a public nuisance shall consist of taking whatever appropriate steps are reasonably necessary to remove the condition or conditions which result in the declaration of a public nuisance.\u201d Town of Nag\u2019s Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-33(b) (2007).\nOn 24 January 2011, the trial court entered orders denying defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss and granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to the claim of abatement. The trial court stated that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s claim for public nuisance and order of abatement is GRANTED\u201d and ordered that defendant \u201cat its sole expense, abate the public nuisance ... by demolishing or removing the structure\u201d and if defendant failed to take such action within 20 days \u201cPlaintiff may enter upon the Property and abate the public nui sance[.]\u201d Defendant appeals the orders denying its motions to dismiss and the order granting partial summary judgment.\nII. Public Trust\nDefendant first contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). As to the public trust doctrine, defendant contends that\nthe public trust doctrine is a common law right in the public that is held by the State of North Carolina and is enforceable only by the State in its sovereign capacity. The Town has no authority under the common law or under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 77-20 to enforce the State\u2019s common law rights, and therefore lacks the requisite subject matter jurisdiction to bring any action predicated on enforcement of the public trust doctrine.\nAlthough the trial court\u2019s order does not state the specific basis for its ruling, it would appear that it was most likely based upon town ordinance \u00a7 16-31(6)(c), since the trial court ordered demolition of the Dwelling. See Town of Nag\u2019s Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-31(6)(c). If the Dwelling was a nuisance because of its location in a public trust area, then the only way to abate the nuisance would be removal of the Dwelling, while conditions such as damage to the Dwelling could most likely be repaired. To the extent that plaintiff seeks removal of the Dwelling as a nuisance according to Town Ordinance \u00a7 16-31(6)(c), we must first consider plaintiff\u2019s standing to enforce the public trust rights of the State.\nPlaintiff claims that it is not seeking to enforce the State\u2019s public trust rights, arguing that\n[t]he Town is not attempting to enforce the State\u2019s public trust rights with this action, but even if it were, it would have authority to do so as a governmental agency. The Defendant relies on dicta in multiple cases which seem to imply that the State of North Carolina must bring an action to enforce public trust rights via the Attorney General. No case in North Carolina has held such against an action brought by anything other than private individuals and entities. Even if determined not to be dicta, the Town acts as a governmental agency and exercises the police power of the State.\n(Citations and quotation marks omitted.)\n\u201cThe standard of review on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is de novo.\u201d Fairfield Harbour v. Midsouth Golf, LLC, _ N.C. App. _, _, 715 S.E.2d 273, 280 (2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\nThis Court has previously described the public trust doctrine as applicable to land adjoining bodies of water:\nThe public trust doctrine is a common law principle providing that certain land associated with bodies of water is held in trust by the State for the benefit of the public. As this Court has held, public trust rights are those rights held in trust by the State for the use and benefit of the people of the State in common. They include, but are not limited to, the right to navigate, swim, hunt, fish and enjoy all recreational activities in the watercourses of the State and the right to freely use and enjoy the State\u2019s ocean and estuarine beaches and public access to the beaches.\nAs such, the public trust doctrine cannot give rise to an assertion of ownership that would be available to any private litigants in like circumstances. Any party, public or private, can assert title to land on the strength of a deed, but only the State, acting in its sovereign capacity, may assert rights in land by means of the public trust doctrine. Indeed, as the United States Supreme Court has stated, the public trust doctrine uniquely implicates a state\u2019s sovereign interests.\nFabrikant v. Currituck Cty., 174 N.C. App. 30, 41-42, 621 S.E.2d 19, 27 (2005) (emphasis added) (citations, quotation marks, ellipses, and brackets omitted).\nThe state is the sole party able to seek non-individualized, or public, remedies for alleged harm to public waters. Under the public trust doctrine,\nthe State holds title to the submerged lands under navigable waters, but it is a title of a different character than that which it holds in other lands. It is a title held in trust for the people of the state so that they may navigate, fish, and carry on commerce in the waters involved.\nOnly the state, through the Attorney General, is authorized to bring in a representative capacity for and on behalf of the using and consuming public of this State actions deemed to be advisable in the public interest.\nNeuse River Found., Inc. v. Smithfield Foods, Inc., 155 N.C. App. 110, 118-19, 574 S.E.2d 48, 54 (2002) (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 114-2(8)(a) (2001)) (emphasis added) (citations and quotation marks omitted), disc. review denied, 356 N.C. 675, 577 S.E.2d 628 (2003). Although public trust rights first developed as a common law doctrine, these rights have been recognized in our General Statutes. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131 (2009); Fabrikant, 174 N.C. App. at 41, 621 S.E.2d at 27. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131 entitled, \u201cResources belong to public; stewardship of conservation agencies; grant and delegation of powers; injunctive relief[,]\u201d provides:\n(a) The marine and estuarine and wildlife resources of the State belong to the people of the State as a whole. The Department and the Wildlife Resources Commission are charged with stewardship of these resources.\n(b) The following powers are hereby granted to the Department and the Wildlife Resources Commission and may be delegated to the Fisheries Director and the Executive Director:\n(1) Comment on and object to permit applications submitted to State agencies which may affect the public trust resources in the land and water areas subject to their respective management duties so as to conserve and protect the public trust rights in such land and water areas;\n(2) Investigate alleged encroachments upon, usurpa-tions of, or other actions in violation of the public trust rights of the people of the State; and\n(3) Initiate contested case proceedings under Chapter 150B for review of permit decisions by State agencies which will adversely affect the public trust rights of the people of the State or initiate civil actions to remove or restrain any unlawful or unauthorized encroachment upon, usurpation of, or any other viola tion of the public trust rights of the people of the State or legal rights of access to such public trust areas.\n(c) Whenever there exists reasonable cause to believe that any person or other legal entity has unlawfully encroached upon, usurped, or otherwise violated the public trust rights of the people of the State or legal rights of access to such public trust areas, a civil action may be instituted by the responsible agency for injunctive relief to restrain the violation and for a mandatory preliminary injunction to restore the resources to an undisturbed condition. The action shall be brought in the superior court of the county in which the violation occurred. The institution of an action for injunctive relief under this section shall not relieve any party to such proceeding from any civil or criminal penalty otherwise prescribed for the violation.\n(d) The Attorney General shall act as the attorney for the agencies and shall initiate actions in the name of and at the request of the Department or the Wildlife Resources Commission.\n(e) In this section, the term \u201cpublic trust resources\u201d means land and water areas, both public and private, subject to public trust rights as that term is defined in G.S. 1-45.1.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131 (emphasis added).\nOne of plaintiffs requested forms of relief, and the one which the trial court presumably granted, is to have defendant\u2019s Dwelling destroyed based on the fact that it is located in a public trust area; plaintiff claims that it is merely addressing a public nuisance and \u201cnot attempting to enforce the State\u2019s public trust rights[.]\u201d Before the trial court, plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated,\nWe are not suing in trespass. We are not suing to quiet title. We are not suing to do anything like that. What we are doing is very similar to if someone had put a big house in the middle of the highway in Nags Head, we would consider that a nuisance and we would want it moved out of the road even though that\u2019s the DOT\u2019S right-of-way. It\u2019s the same sort of situation.\nWe disagree. As to this portion of plaintiff\u2019s argument, plaintiff claims it has the right to remove the Dwelling based solely upon public trust rights. This is not a case involving access to the shoreline across pri vate property, protecting property which has already been determined to be a public trust area, or a myriad of other such similar situations; this is a case where a governmental agency is attempting to take private property from an individual, destroy the Dwelling, and claim the land on the basis that it currently lies within a public trust area. Plaintiff\u2019s analogy regarding the presence of a house in the middle of a highway is not accurate, as in this case the house was already lawfully constructed on its current location prior to the plaintiffs assertion of public trust rights. If a house were lawfully constructed and then the State decided to construct a highway through the middle of the house, the State would first have to condemn the property and pay just compensation to the landowner. See generally Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. M.M. Fowler, Inc., 361 N.C. 1, 4, 637 S.E.2d 885, 889 (2006) (\u201cThe right to take private property for public use, the power of eminent domain, is one of the prerogatives of a sovereign state. The right is inherent in sovereignty; it is not conferred by constitutions. Its exercise, however, is limited by the constitutional requirements of due process and payment of just compensation for property condemned. Both the state and federal constitutions limit the State\u2019s power of eminent domain. North Carolina\u2019s Constitution protects the rights of property owners through the Law of the Land Clause, which provides that no person shall be deprived of his property, but by the law of the land. In other words, although the State can condemn land for public use, the owner must be justly compensated.\u201d (citations, quotation marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted)). Plaintiff does not contest that the Dwelling was originally lawfully constructed in its current location and that the mean high water line has changed to some extent since it was constructed; only the alleged change after the construction of the Dwelling gives rise to plaintiff\u2019s asserted rights. Regardless of plaintiff\u2019s attempt to argue that nuisance is the basis of its claims, the potential destruction of defendant\u2019s Dwelling based upon the claim that it is located within a public trust area is actually an \u201cattempt[] to enforce the State\u2019s public trust rights[.]\u201d\nSecond, we note that the language in Fabrikant and Neuse heavily emphasizes the sovereignty of the State as being the only body which can affirmatively bring an action to assert rights under the public trust doctrine. See Fabrikant, 174 N.C. App. at 41, 621 S.E.2d at 27; Neuse River Found., Inc., 155 N.C. App. at 118-19, 574 S.E.2d at 54. Our case law clearly reflects that affirmative actions regarding public trust property must be taken by the State \u201cthrough the Attorney General[.]\u201d Neuse River Found., Inc., 155 N.C. App. at 119, 574 S.E.2d at 54; contrast Fish House, Inc. v. Clarke, 204 N.C. App. 130, 136-37, 693 S.E.2d 208, 212-13 (determining that an entity besides the State could use the public trust' doctrine as a defense in an action, but emphasizing that only the State may use the doctrine offensively), disc. review denied, 364 N.C. 324, 700 S.E.2d 750 (2010). Regardless of whether the statements in both Fabrikant and Neuse were dicta, the clear mandate of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131 is that \u201c[t]he Attorney General shall act as the attorney\u201d \u201c[w]henever there exists reasonable cause to believe that any person or other legal entity has unlawfully encroached upon, usurped, or otherwise violated the public trust rights of the people of the State[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131(c), (d). In addition, it is entirely reasonable to grant this power to the State only, in order to minimize conflicts between municipalities or other local governments and the state agencies which have been granted the responsibility of managing and protecting \u2019\u2019public trust rights of the people of the State or legal rights of access to such public trust areas[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131(c).\nJust such a conflict between the requirements of state law and the local ordinance seems to exist in this case. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131, Town of Nags Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-31, -33. As plaintiff\u2019s attorney conceded before the trial court, the Attorney General \u201cmay be\u2014I don\u2019t think that I would disagree that they are probably the only party that can assert an interest in land based on the public trust.\u201d An interest in land is exactly what plaintiff seeks here. Plaintiff is not merely seeking public access to the shoreline across defend-ant\u2019s property; plaintiff is seeking to demolish defendant\u2019s Dwelling and to prevent defendant from making any economic use of the property whatsoever. Because only the State, acting through the Attorney General, has standing to bring an action to enforce the State\u2019s public trust rights in accord with N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131, we conclude that this claim must be dismissed. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113-131; Neuse River Found., Inc., 155 N.C. App. at 119, 574 S.E.2d at 54. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the trial court denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).\nIII. Personal or Property Injury\nDefendant' also contends' that the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff based upon Town Ordinance \u00a7 16-31(6)(b). Defendant contends that \u201c[t]here is a question of material fact as to whether the cottage posed a likelihood of personal or property injury.\u201d Plaintiff contends that it \u201chas produced substantial, material and uncontroverted evidence that the condition of the Cottage can reasonably be determined to be likely to cause personal or property injury.\u201d Plaintiff then directs this Court\u2019s attention to its verified complaint and two affidavits from Cliff Ogburn (\u201cMr. Ogburn\u201d), Town Manager.\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The standard of review from a grant or denial of summary judgment is de novo. Because summary judgment is a drastic remedy that eliminates the need for a full trial, summary judgment should be granted cautiously.\nMatthews v. Food Lion, LLC, _ N.C. App. _, _, 695 S.E.2d 828, 830 (2010) (citations and quotation marks omitted).\nAs we have already noted, plaintiff\u2019s verified complaint states that the Town\u2019s Manager inspected the Dwelling and concluded:\na. That the Dwelling was in a deteriorated and damaged condition;\nb. That the Dwelling was disconnected from utilities;\nc. That the Dwelling was disconnected from approved means of sewage disposal;\nd. That components of the Dwelling\u2019s on-site sewage disposal system were visibly damaged or missing;\nh. That the Dwelling had incurred storm and/or erosion damage[.]\nMr. Ogburn averred that\n8. The wave action and tides associated with the November Storm caused significant damage to the [Dwelling],\n9.Since at least October 6, 2008, the [Dwelling] has been damaged to such an extent that its condition made it unsafe for human habitation and it has been condemned by the Town\u2019s building inspector pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160A-426. The Defendant has not taken any corrective action to remedy the issues with the [Dwelling] which caused [it] to be declared unsafe for human habitation and condemned by the Town\u2019s building inspector.\n10. Since the November Storm, if not earlier, the [Dwelling] was and remains in a deteriorated, decaying and damaged condition which includes, but is not limited to, having unsupported decking, missing exterior stairways or other means of ingress and egress, having weakened or failing structural components or other portions of the [Dwelling] which could injure passersby or their property without warning.\n11. Since the November Storm, if not earlier the dilapidated condition of the [Dwelling] has caused or contributed to blight, is dangerous to children, and has attracted persons intent on criminal activities or other nuisance activities.\n13. Since the November Storm, if not earlier, the Cottage was and remains disconnected from electricity, water service and other utilities.\n14. Since the November Storm, if not earlier, the [Dwelling] was and remains disconnected from any form of sewage disposal, approved or otherwise.\n15. Since the November Storm, if not earlier, the [Dwelling] had and continues to have components of its on-site sewage disposal system which are damaged, destroyed, missing or otherwise rendered inoperable.\n16. Since the November Storm, if not earlier, the [Dwelling] had components of its on-site sewage disposal system which were visible and accessible to the public causing blight and causing the public to have concern over whether the Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of the Property could be enjoyed safely.\n22. Since the November Storm, if not earlier, the [Dwelling] has been and remains completely blocking public or emergency vehicle access to and travel along the ocean beaches.\n27. Due to the condition and location of the [Dwelling], each such weather event has the immediate potential to cause additional erosion and storm damage to the Property and the [Dwelling] and thereby to create an increased risk of injury or danger to the citizens, residents and visitors of the Town and their property by causing all or part of the [Dwelling] to collapse, fall or otherwise become an instrument of destruction or a dangerous projectile.\n28. This risk of imminent damage, destruction and danger extends beyond the weather event itself as portions of structures such as the [Dwelling] remain in the Atlantic Ocean and on the ocean beaches causing continued and dangerous conditions for those members of the public exercising their rights to enjoy the Atlantic Ocean and ocean beaches.\n30. The condition and location of the [Dwelling] significantly interferes with the public health, the public safety, the public peace, the public comfort and the public convenience.\nMr. Ogburn\u2019s second affidavit stated that the statements in his first affidavit \u201cremain true and accurate [, and t]o the extent conditions have changed on the Property, they have changed in a manner showing further deterioration of the [Dwelling] and further erosion of the Property.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Lance Goldner (\u201cMr. Goldner\u201d), president of defendant, averred in his affidavit that:\n5. On November 12-14, 2009, the Property was affected by wave action resulting from what is now known as Nor\u2019Easter Ida. As a result of this wave action, the [Dwelling] on the Property lost its wooden access steps, the drain lines for its septic field, and also lost its electrical and water connections. Otherwise the [Dwelling] is in habitable condition and is not suffering from any structural defects that would make it unsafe.\n7. ... I have been making efforts to have the [Dwelling] repaired, but these efforts have been blocked by the Town.\n8. I attempted to obtain a building permit to repair the [Dwelling], but was told by Town officials that I would first need to obtain a CAMA permit, which is also issued by the Town.\n9. I obtained an Improvement Permit from the Dare County Health Department to repair the septic system ....\n10. I sought a CAMA permit from the Town for repair of the septic system, and was denied on November 22, 2010 on the purported basis that my repair of the septic field constituted a \u201creplacement\u201d of the system....\n11. The septic tank on the property is not cracked and can be reused and only needs to be buried in the ground. Otherwise all that is needed is to reinstall the septic drain lines ....\nFurthermore, we note that when plaintiff issued its \u201cDeclaration of Nuisance Structure, Order of Abatement and Warning Citation\u201d to defendant it stated, \u201cNo development permits will be issued for this structure.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs own evidence lends credence to Mr. Goldner\u2019s statement that he has attempted to repair the Dwelling but has been prevented from doing so by plaintiff.\nIn summary, Mr. Ogbum averred that\nthe [Dwelling] was and remains in a deteriorated, decaying and damaged condition which includes, but is not limited to, having unsupported decking, missing exterior stairways or other means of ingress and egress, having weakened or failing structural components or other portions of the [Dwelling] which could injure passersby or their property without warning.\nIn contrast, Mr. Goldner claimed that \u201cthe cottage is in habitable condition and is not suffering from any structural defects that would make it unsafe],]\u201d and plaintiff has refused to allow defendant to make repairs which are needed.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to defendant, as we must for purposes of summary judgment, Fairfield Harbour Property Owners Ass\u2019n, Inc., _ N.C. App. at _, 715 S.E.2d at 281, it appears that the main defects in the dwelling are the lack of con nections to a septic tank, electricity, and water and some exterior damage to stairs, but it is structurally sound and in need of relatively minor repairs, which defendant would have promptly performed if plaintiff had not refused to issue the required permits. Mr. Ogburn\u2019s first affidavit, in paragraphs 27 and 28, also seems to rely heavily on the risk that future storm events will cause more damage to the Dwelling and it will then pose a greater danger; yet these statements express his opinion about what may happen in the future, and certainly if a future storm event does further undermine the Dwelling, plaintiff may seek relief on the basis of this new condition.\nTown Ordinance \u00a7 16-31(6)(b) does not state that any possibility \u201cof personal or property injury\u201d created by the condition of the Dwelling is a violation, but instead a \u201creasonable] . . . likelihood\u201d of injury. Town of Nags Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-31(6)(b). Although this is not a negligence case, the determination of what is reasonably likely to cause \u201cpersonal or property injury\u201d, id., either now or in the future, is similar to the determination of negligence, which also requires a determination of reasonableness; summary judgment is rarely appropriate \u201cin a negligence case in which a jury ordinarily applies the reasonable person standard to the facts of each case.\u201d See generally Williams v. Power & Light Co., 296 N.C. 400, 402, 250 S.E.2d 255, 257 (1979). In this case, there is a material question of fact as to whether the condition of the Dwelling creates a \u201creasonable]... likelihood of personal or property injury\u201d and the evidence forecast by the parties is conflicting. Town of Nags Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-31(6)(b); see Matthews, _ N.C. App. at _, 695 S.E.2d at 830. In addition, if defendant were allowed to repair the Dwelling, as Mr. Goldner\u2019s affidavit states that it would have done if not prevented by plaintiff, the Dwelling may not pose any risk of \u201cpersonal or property injury[.]\u201d Town of Nags Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-31(6)(b). Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.\nIV. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and reverse the trial court\u2019s partial summary judgment order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion solely as to the issue of whether the Dwelling is a nuisance under Town Ordinance \u00a7 16-31(6)(b) and if so, to determine appropriate relief.\nREVERSED and REMANDED in part.\nJudges STEPHENS and BEASLEY concur.\n. Neither party contests the applicability of Town Ordinance 16-31(6) which addresses only \u201c[s]torm or erosion damaged structures and resulting debris.\u201d Town of Nags Head, N.C., Code \u00a7 16-31(6) (2007).\n. In its verified complaint, plaintiff also requested monetary relief due to civil penalties incurred by defendant in failing to abate the Dwelling; this request was not addressed in the trial court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. However, as this is a final order as to the claim of abatement and the trial court certified its order pursuant to North Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) as a final order, we will address defendant\u2019s appeal. See Stinoheomb v. Presbyterian Med. Care, _N.C. App._,_, 710 S.E.2d 320, 323 (\u201c[A]n interlocutory order may be immediately appealed (1) if the order is final as to some but not all of the claims or parties and the trial court certifies there is no just reason to delay the appeal pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 54(b)[.]\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)), disc, review denied,_N.C._, 717 S.E.2d 376 (2011).\n. We need not address plaintiff\u2019s arguments regarding changes in the mean high water line and the location of defendant\u2019s Dwelling in reference to it, as plaintiff does not have standing to bring such an argument to enforce rights under the public trust doctrine.\n. As we are dismissing defendant\u2019s claim for \u201cabatement\u201d of the alleged public nuisance under the public trust doctrine pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), we need not address defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).", "author": "STROUD, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["TOWN OF NAGS HEAD, Plaintiff v.

On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence in violation of the discovery rules and in denying his request for a special jury instruction on the knowledge element of both offenses. We hold defendant received a fair trial free from prejudicial error.\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\nIn September 2009, officers with the Raleigh Police Department\u2019s career criminal unit arrested James Joseph McMillan (\u201cMcMillan\u201d) for drug offenses involving selling cocaine to suspected local gang members. Federal investigators took custody of McMillan, and McMillan agreed to cooperate with Raleigh police in investigating a local drug organization to help with his federal sentence.\nMcMillan told police his primary source for cocaine was Luis Nunez Garcia (\u201cLuis\u201d). McMillan also mentioned Luis\u2019s brother, Manuel Nunez Garcia (\u201cManuel\u201d). The police focused their investigation on Luis. Using McMillan as a confidential informant, police officers arranged to make a controlled purchase of cocaine from Luis, with the ultimate objective of learning more about Luis and his operation and identifying more targets up the supply chain before arresting Luis. McMillan\u2019s primary contact in the Raleigh Police Department was Officer Keith Heckman (\u201cOfficer Heckman\u201d).\nOn 10 December 2009, McMillan made arrangements by phone to purchase one ounce of cocaine from Luis. Officer Heckman and Detective Jason Hoyle (\u201cDetective Hoyle\u201d) then outfitted McMillan with hidden audio-video equipment and gave him $1,000 in marked bills. Thereafter, Luis called McMillan and told McMillan to meet him at a specific CVS Pharmacy for the exchange. Officer Heckman and Detective Hoyle followed McMillan to the CVS Pharmacy and took up surveillance positions, along with other officers.\nOnce McMillan arrived at the CVS Pharmacy, he called Luis. Luis told McMillan he was at the hospital with his son, but his brother Manuel and another individual would be at the CVS Pharmacy in a burgundy van. McMillan identified the van in the parking lot and got into the backseat. Manuel was in the front passenger seat of the van, and defendant was in the driver\u2019s seat. Officers confirmed two individuals were inside the van besides McMillan.\nInside the van, a conversation occurred regarding the present cocaine purchase. During the conversation, McMillan was also questioned about a debt he owed Luis for a prior drug transaction. Luis was also contacted and consulted by telephone during the conversation. The conversation was partly in Spanish between defendant, Manuel, and Luis, and partly in English when communications were made to McMillan. During the transaction, Manuel sold 37.05 grams of cocaine, a trafficking amount, to McMillan. The entire transaction was captured on McMillan\u2019s hidden audio-video equipment.\nAfter completing the purchase, McMillan left the CVS Pharmacy and met Officer Heckman at another location, at which Officer Heckman retrieved the drugs and the audio-video equipment from McMillan. Police made no arrests that day in order to continue their ongoing investigation into the drug operation.\nOn 7 January 2010, Luis and Manuel were arrested on murder charges in Chatham County, North Carolina. Thereafter, on 13 January 2010, defendant was arrested on drug charges related to the 10 December 2009 drug transaction. On 8 March 2010, defendant was indicted for trafficking cocaine by transportation, trafficking cocaine by possession, and conspiracy to sell cocaine. Defendant was tried by jury beginning 3 August 2010.\nPrior to trial, defense counsel filed a motion for discovery, specifically soliciting information regarding any expert witnesses the State intended to call at trial, as well as any reports or other written material produced by such experts. In response, the State produced a translated transcript of the audio-video recording of the transaction. However, at a hearing held just prior to trial, the State revealed the transcript had not been translated by a translator certified by the Administrative Office of the Courts (\u201cAOC\u201d). Immediately following the hearing, the State contacted Fred Albritton (\u201cAlbritton\u201d), an AOC-certified Spanish interpreter, to prepare a second transcript of the audio-video recording by making any necessary edits to the original transcript. Albritton completed the second transcript around 1:00 p.m. on Friday, 30 July 2010, and a copy of the transcript was received by defendant later that afternoon. In the revised transcript, Albritton identified three voices present inside the van and labeled them Cl, for \u201cconfidential informant;\u201d HI, for \u201cHispanic 1;\u201d and H2, for \u201cHispanic 2.\u201d Albritton also identified a fourth voice on the audio recording as an individual communicating by telephone.\nDefense counsel moved the trial court to suppress the revised transcript and preclude Albritton from testifying, arguing the State had failed to timely provide information as to the identity and qualifications of the translator in violation of the rules of discovery. The State argued it was not presenting Albritton as an expert, and the trial court held a voir dire hearing before denying defendant\u2019s motion, overruling his objection, and allowing both Albritton to testify and the transcript into evidence.\nDuring trial, the audio-video recording was played for the jury twice. The second time, the jury was provided a copy of Albritton\u2019s transcript of the audio portion to read along while they observed and listened to the video. Albritton testified that he believed the speaker designated as HI in the transcript was \u201cthe person sitting to the left in the video, which seems to be where the driver\u2019s seat is located in the vehicle.\u201d Albritton testified he based his identification on the \u201ctonal quality of the voice and accent,\u201d as well as contextual clues from the video portion of the recording. Albritton further testified he did not think his translation was 100 percent accurate and that parts of the recording were indiscernible, given the poor quality of the recording. Following Albritton\u2019s testimony, defendant again moved to strike the evidence and also moved the trial court for a mistrial, raising the discovery violation issue regarding Albritton\u2019s alleged expert opinion evidence. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motions.\nOfficer Heckman, Detective Hoyle, and McMillan also testified at trial as to the events surrounding the investigation and the transaction at issue, and defendant testified in his own defense. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned verdicts of guilty of both trafficking cocaine by possession and conspiracy to sell cocaine and not guilty of trafficking by transportation.\nAt sentencing, the trial court consolidated the two charges, found one mitigating factor, and imposed a term of 35 to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment and a $50,000 fine. Defendant timely appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to this Court.\nII. Admission of Evidence\nDefendant first contends the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the transcript of the recording of the drug transaction and the testimony of Albritton, the interpreter who prepared that transcript. Defendant argues the State violated the rules of discovery by failing to disclose to the defense in a timely manner the contents of the transcript, the identity of the expert who prepared it, and the State\u2019s intent to offer Albritton\u2019s expert opinion testimony concerning both the identity of the individuals speaking on the audio-video recording and the meaning of the conversation taking place. Defendant argues the State\u2019s discovery violation required exclusion of the challenged evidence and that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of the evidence at trial.\n\u201cDiscovery in a criminal case is governed by Chapter 15A, Article 48 of the North Carolina General Statutes.\u201d State v. Ellis, _ N.C. App. _, _, 696 S.E.2d 536, 539 (2010). Specifically, upon a defense motion, the court must order:\nThe prosecuting attorney to give notice to the defendant of any expert witnesses that the State reasonably expects to call as a witness at trial. Each such witness shall prepare, and the State shall furnish to the defendant, a report of the results of any examinations or tests conducted by the expert. The State shall also furnish to the defendant the expert\u2019s curriculum vitae, the expert\u2019s opinion, and the underlying basis for that opinion. The State shall give the notice and furnish the materials required by this subsection within a reasonable time prior to trial, as specified by the court.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-903(a)(2) (2011). \u201c[O]nce a party, or the State has provided discovery there is a continuing duty to provide discovery and disclosure.\u201d State v. Blankenship, 178 N.C. App. 351, 354, 631 S.E.2d 208, 210 (2006); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-907 (2011).\n\u201c[T]he purpose of discovery under our statutes is to protect the defendant from unfair surprise by the introduction of evidence he cannot anticipate.\u201d State v. Payne, 327 N.C. 194, 202, 394 S.E.2d 158, 162 (1990). N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-910 (2011) empowers the trial court to apply sanctions for noncompliance with the discovery rules, including granting a continuance or recess, prohibiting the introduction of non-disclosed evidence, or declaring a mistrial. Id. \u00a7 15A-910(a)(2), (3), (3a). \u201cAlthough the court has the authority to impose such discovery violation sanctions, it is not required to do so.\u201d State v. Hodge, 118 N.C. App. 655, 657, 456 S.E.2d 855, 856 (1995). \u201cBecause the trial court is not required to impose any sanctions for abuse of discovery orders, what sanctions to impose, if any, is within the trial court\u2019s discretion[,]\u201d and will not be reversed absent a showing of abuse of that discretion. State v. Weeks, 322 N.C. 152, 171, 367 S.E.2d 895, 906 (1988).\nDuring the trial in the present case, when the State proceeded to introduce the transcript prepared by Albritton and to call Albritton as a witness, the trial court held a voir dire hearing to determine the admissibility of the challenged evidence. During the voir dire hearing, the State conceded that were Albritton testifying as an expert, then the State had violated the discovery rules by not providing the requisite information in a timely manner. However, the State insisted at trial that Albritton would not be testifying as an expert. The trial court agreed and admitted the transcript and Albritton\u2019s testimony. On appeal, the State concedes Albritton did in fact testify as an expert regarding his opinion of the translated conversation, as reflected in his transcript, thereby conceding the trial court abused its discretion in determining the witness was not testifying as an expert. See Blankenship, 178 N.C. App. at 354-55, 631 S.E.2d at 211 (\u201cThe determination of whether a witness\u2019 testimony constitutes expert testimony is one within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Accordingly, because the challenged evidence consisted entirely of an expert\u2019s opinion, the trial court erred in failing to recognize the State\u2019s failure to properly comply with the discovery requirements pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-903(a)(2). State v. Moncree, 188 N.C. App. 221, 227, 655 S.E.2d 464, 468 (2008).\nNonetheless, the record reveals, and defendant admits in his reply brief, that \u201cdefense counsel was provided enough information to be able to anticipate that the [S]tate would offer expert testimony translating the Spanish portions of the conversation in the vehicle.\u201d Indeed, defendant was well aware of the State\u2019s initial attempt to have the audio interpreted and transcribed in light of the fact that part of the audio was in Spanish and that defendant was charged with the present offenses based on his involvement in the transaction. See Moncree, 188 N.C. App. at 226-27, 655 S.E.2d at 468 (defendant should not have been unfairly surprised by officer\u2019s testimony regarding substance found in defendant\u2019s shoe where defendant was charged with one count of possession of a controlled substance on the premises of a local confinement facility). Furthermore, the record reveals defense counsel was informed during the pretrial hearing that there was a problem with the original transcript, that the State would not use the original transcript, that the State would contact an AOC-certified interpreter to transcribe the conversation, and that the State would call the interpreter to testify.\nAlthough defendant argues he could not reasonably anticipate what the precise translation would be or that Albritton would offer an opinion that the speaker denoted as HI in the transcript was the driver of the vehicle, his arguments are inapposite, as both speakers in the transcript are implicated in the transaction, regardless of which Hispanic voice was attributed to the driver of the vehicle, or defend-ant. We also note that defendant had \u201ca full opportunity at trial to cross-examine\u201d Albritton concerning his opinion as to the identity of the speakers in the recording and the meaning of the conversation taking place on that recording, as well as the accuracy of the transcript he prepared and the difficulties he faced in preparing the translation. See Ellis, _ N.C. App. at _, 696 S.E.2d at 540-41. The record demonstrates the trial court considered these circumstances surrounding the alleged discovery violation both before and after admitting the challenged evidence and decided not to impose any of the requested discovery violation sanctions. Thus, we discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s failing to strike the challenged evidence in the present case.\nFurther, assuming arguendo that the trial court erred in allowing the transcript and Albritton\u2019s expert testimony into evidence, defendant cannot show he was prejudiced by the error. \u201cA defendant is prejudiced by errors relating to rights arising other than under the Constitution of the United States when there is a reasonable possibility that, had the error in question not been committed, a different result would have been reached at the trial out of which the appeal arises.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(a) (2011). \u201cThe burden of showing such prejudice under this subsection is upon the defendant.\u201d Id.\nHere, defendant argues the transcript was the State\u2019s strongest evidence that defendant was acting in concert with Manuel during the drug transaction. Defendant argues the quality of the audio-video recording and the camera angle make it impossible to determine defendant\u2019s involvement in the transaction and therefore the video lends little value to the State\u2019s case without Albritton\u2019s interpretation of the events and conversation depicted. Defendant also argues without the transcript, the State\u2019s case relied almost entirely on McMillan\u2019s testimony, a witness of doubtful credibility and a prior criminal record. Defendant further argues McMillan\u2019s testimony is ambiguous as to defendant\u2019s role in the transaction and does not disprove defendant\u2019s testimony that he was unaware of the drug transaction until McMillan entered his vehicle.\nDespite defendant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the State had abundant other admissible evidence of defendant\u2019s participation in the drug transaction such that there is no reasonable possibility that, had Albritton\u2019s testimony and the transcript he prepared not been admitted into evidence, a different result would have been reached at trial. At trial, defendant admitted he was the driver of the van in question, that he was present and did not leave the vehicle during the drug transaction, and that he did not object in any way during the transaction. McMillan identified defendant in court as the driver of the van and testified that defendant was talking on the phone with Luis during the transaction, asked McMillan for the money to pay off a prior debt McMillan owed Luis, did not appear nervous, and remained in the van during the entire exchange. Although defendant attacks the credibility of McMillan as a witness on appeal, McMillan\u2019s testimony nonetheless constituted evidence against defendant for the jury to properly consider. State v. Lewis, 172 N.C. App. 97, 107, 616 S.E.2d 1, 7 (2005) (\u201c[I]t is the province of the jury to weigh the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d).\nMoreover, the audio-video recording shows the driver of the van asked McMillan for the money to pay off McMillan\u2019s prior debt to Luis and that the driver of the van was speaking on the phone with the individual identified by McMillan as Luis, as the video clearly depicts an exchange of the cell phone between McMillan and the driver of the vehicle. The jury watched this video once during trial, without assistance from the transcript. In addition, the jury asked the trial court, during its deliberations, to view the video again, which was granted. Given this evidence adduced at trial, we fail to see how the trial court\u2019s alleged error in admitting the challenged evidence prejudiced defendant.\nDespite our present holding, we reiterate the importance of the State\u2019s compliance with statutory discovery requirements. \u201cDistrict attorneys are elected public officials, and therefore North Carolina citizens trust the people who serve as district attorneys. Failure of district attorneys to follow statutory discovery requirements erodes the public\u2019s trust not only in district attorneys, but in any public official.\u201d Moncree, 188 N.C. App. at 228, 655 S.E.2d at 468.\nIII. Jury Instruction\nDefendant\u2019s remaining argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying his request for a special instruction to the jury on the word \u201cknowingly,\u201d as it appears in the elements of the offenses for trafficking by possession and conspiracy to sell cocaine. Defendant contends his requested instruction was a correct statement of the law arising on the evidence presented at trial and that defendant\u2019s knowledge was an issue in the case, thereby requiring the trial court to give the requested special instruction. This Court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decisions regarding jury instructions. State v. Cruz, 203 N.C. App. 230, 235, 691 S.E.2d 47, 50 (citing State v. Osorio, 196 N.C. App. 458, 466, 675 S.E.2d 144, 149 (2009)), aff\u2019d, 364 N.C. 417, 700 S.E.2d 222 (2010).\nWe first summarily address the State\u2019s contention that defendant did not preserve this issue for appellate review. During trial, when given an opportunity to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, defense counsel responded he had no corrections to the trial court\u2019s instructions as given \u201cbeyond what we have asked for and lost.\u201d Thus, although defendant did not specifically \u201cobject\u201d to the instructions, he alerted the trial court to the ruling he desired with respect to the requested instruction, thereby preserving the issue for appellate review. Cf. State v. Joplin, 318 N.C. 126, 131-32, 347 S.E.2d 421, 424 (1986) (holding defendant failed to preserve for appellate review the issue of whether the trial court committed reversible error in failing to include her requested jury instruction by failing to object to the jury instructions when given the opportunity to do so by the trial court).\n\u201cA trial judge is required ... to instruct the jury on the law arising on the evidence. This includes instruction on the elements of the crime. Knowledge is a substantive feature of the crime[s] charged here. Failure to instruct upon all substantive or material features of the crime charged is error.\u201d State v. Bogle, 324 N.C. 190, 195, 376 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1989). \u201c[I]f a party requests an instruction which is a correct statement of the law and is supported by the evidence, the court must give the instruction at least in substance.\" State v. Warren, 327 N.C. 364, 371, 395 S.E.2d 116, 121 (1990) (emphasis added). \u201cNorth Carolina statutes and case law do not require a trial court to use the exact words a defendant requests to charge the jury.\u201d State v. Sanders, 171 N.C. App. 46, 53, 613 S.E.2d 708, 713 (citing State v. Vause, 328 N.C. 231, 239, 400 S.E.2d 57, 63 (1991)), aff'd, 360 N.C. 170, 622 S.E.2d 492 (2005).\nIn the present case, defendant requested the trial court give the following instruction on the element that defendant must have \u201cknowingly\u201d participated in the crimes:\nYou have been instructed that in order to sustain its burden of proof, the government must prove that the defendant acted knowingly. A person acts knowingly if he acts intentionally and voluntarily, and not because of ignorance, mistake, accident, or carelessness. Whether the defendant acted knowingly may be proven by the defendant\u2019s conduct and by all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.\nDefendant points out that he testified at trial that he had no prior knowledge that Luis or Manuel were involved in selling drugs or that Manuel intended to conduct a drug transaction when defendant drove him to the CVS pharmacy. Defendant maintained he was unaware of Manuel\u2019s intentions until McMillan entered the vehicle. Thus, defendant argues the evidence presented places his knowledge of the offenses in issue, and the trial court was therefore required to give his requested instruction.\nIn the present case, the trial court gave the following instructions to the jury:\nIntent is a mental attitude seldom provable by direct evidence. It must ordinarily be proven by circumstances from which it may be inferred.\nYou arrive at the intent of a person by such just and reasonable deductions from the circumstances proven as a reasonably prudent person would draw from those circumstances.\nA person has constructive possession of the substance if the person does not have it on his person but is aware of its presence, and has either alone or together with others both the power and intent to control its disposition or use.\nA person\u2019s awareness of the presence of the substance and the person\u2019s power and intent to control its disposition or use may be shown by direct evidence or may be inferred from the circumstances.\n(Emphasis added.) Further, when instructing the jury on the specific offenses charged, the trial court gave the following instructions:\nThe Defendant has been charged with trafficking in cocaine by possession, which is the unlawful possession of more than 28 grams of cocaine.\nFor you to find the Defendant guilty of this offense the State must prove two things beyond a reasonable doubt:\nFirst, that the Defendant knowingly possessed cocaine.\nA person possess[es] cocaine if he is aware of its presence and has either by himself or together with others both the power and intent to control its disposition or use of that substance.\nThe Defendant has also been charged with feloniously conspiring to sell cocaine. For you to find the Defendant guilty of this offense the State must prove three things beyond a reasonable doubt:\nFirst, that the Defendant and Luis Nunez Garcia and Manuel Nunez Garcia entered into an agreement.\nSecond, that the agreement was to sell cocaine. Selling cocaine is knowingly selling cocaine to another.\n(Emphasis added.) We hold the instructions given by the trial court, when read as a whole, adequately contained the substance of defendant\u2019s requested instruction\u2014an explanation that defendant must have intentionally and voluntarily participated in the crimes.\nOur Supreme Court has previously provided the meaning of the word \u201cknowingly.\u201d In State v. Stephenson, 218 N.C. 258, 10 S.E.2d 819 (1940), our Supreme Court explained \u201c[t]he word \u2018knowingly\u2019. . . means that defendant knew what he was about to do, and, with such knowledge, proceeded to do the act charged.\u201d Id. at 264, 10 S.E.2d at 823. Subsequently, in Underwood v. Board of Alcoholic Control, 278 N.C. 623, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971), our Supreme Court noted:\nKnowledge means \u201can impression of the mind, the state of being aware; and this may be acquired in numerous ways and from many sources. It is usually obtained from a variety of facts and circumstances. Generally speaking, when it is said that a person has knowledge of a given condition, it is meant that his relation to it, his association with it, his control over it, and his direction of it are such as to give him actual information concerning it.\u201d\nId. at 632, 181 S.E.2d at 7 (quoting State v. Hightower, 187 N.C. 300, 308-09, 121 S.E. 616, 621 (1924)). Here, the trial court instructed the jury that in order to possess or sell cocaine, the defendant must have been aware of its presence and have had the power and intent to control its distribution or use. Therefore, the substance of the trial court\u2019s instructions, read in their entirety, effectively instructs the jury that defendant must have had knowledge of the substance and the crime being committed, and he must have intentionally and voluntarily participated in the crime. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions.\nHowever, we must note that had the trial court simply given the instruction requested by defendant at trial, defendant would have no basis to raise the trial court\u2019s decision not to do so on appeal. The better practice under circumstances such as those presented here is for the trial court to give the jury instruction requested by defendant when the requested instruction is correct on the law and properly based on the evidence adduced at trial.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe hold the trial court erred in determining that Albritton did not give expert testimony and in failing to recognize the State\u2019s resulting discovery violation. However, we discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request to strike the challenged evidence, and defendant has failed to meet his burden of showing he was prejudiced by the alleged error.\nIn addition, although the trial court denied defendant\u2019s request for a special jury instruction on the knowledge element of both offenses, we hold the trial court\u2019s jury instructions included the substance of defendant\u2019s requested instruction, and therefore, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request was not erroneous. Accordingly, we hold defendant received a fair trial, free from prejudicial error.\nNo prejudicial error.\nJudges McGEE and GEER concur.", "author": "McCullough, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Wheeler, for Defendants.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STEPHENS, Judge.\nAfter voluntarily dismissing a nearly identical prior action commenced on 20 September 2010, Plaintiff Elizabeth Dixon commenced the present action by filing a complaint in Davidson County Superior Court on 20 April 2011 against Defendants Randall and Laura Gist. In her complaint, Dixon alleged that she was \u201cbefriended\u201d by the Gists, \u201ctricked into believing a special relationship of trust and confidence had been established with [the Gists],\u201d \u201cinduced\u201d by the Gists to \u201cconvert[ her] bank account into a joint account with rights of survivor-ship\u201d with the Gists, and, ultimately, \u201cdefrauded\u201d by the Gists \u201cout of sixteen [] acres of land and property\u201d and many thousands of dollars in cash. Based on Dixon\u2019s allegedly fraud-induced conveyance of real property to the Gists and on the Gists\u2019 allegedly fraudulent withdrawal of money from Dixon\u2019s bank account, Dixon asserted claims against the Gists for constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, undue influence, conversion, and \u201cdeclaratory judgment voiding conveyances.\u201d On 24 May 2011, the Gists filed their answer to Dixon\u2019s complaint, along with a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court, Judge Theodore S. Royster, Jr. presiding, granted the Gists\u2019 motion in a 6 June 2011 order, concluding that the Gists were entitled to judgment dismissing Dixon\u2019s claims. From the order dismissing her claims, as well as a subsequent order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the Gists, Dixon appeals, arguing that the trial court\u2019s conclusions that her claims were subject to dismissal were erroneous. With respect to Dixon\u2019s claims arising from the allegedly fraud-induced conveyance of real property, we disagree with Dixon and conclude that the trial court properly dismissed those claims. However, we agree with Dixon that the trial court erroneously dismissed her constructive fraud and related claims arising from the allegedly fraudulent withdrawal of money from her bank account.\nA motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to North Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) should only be granted when \u201cthe movant clearly establishes that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Minor v. Minor, 70 N.C. App. 76, 78, 318 S.E.2d 865, 867, disc. review denied, 312 N.C. 495, 322 S.E.2d 558 (1984). When ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, \u201c[a]ll well pleaded factual allegations in the nonmoving party\u2019s pleadings are taken as true,\u201d and \u201c[t]he trial court is required to view the facts and permissible inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. 130, 137, 209 S.E.2d 494, 499 (1974). Further, the trial court is to consider \u201conly the pleadings and any attached exhibits, which become part of the pleadings.\u201d Minor, 70 N.C. App. at 78, 318 S.E.2d at 867. On appeal, we review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo. Toomer v. Branch Banking & Tr. Co., 171 N.C. App. 58, 66, 614 S.E.2d 328, 335, disc. review denied, 360 N.C. 78, 623 S.E.2d 263 (2005).\nIn this case, Dixon\u2019s claims arising from the allegedly fraud-induced conveyance of real property\u2014asserted in her initial complaint filed 20 September 2010, and reasserted in her 20 April 2011 complaint filed after voluntary dismissal of the initial complaint\u2014 were properly dismissed because the pleadings show that these claims were filed after the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations. See N.C. State Ports Auth. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 294 N.C. 73, 80, 240 S.E.2d 345, 349 (1978) (holding that judgment on the pleadings is proper if it appears from the pleadings \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover is barred by the lapse of time\u201d); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-52(9) (2011) (three-year statute of limitations for claims of fraud). In her complaint, Dixon alleges that in June 2007 the Gists persuaded Dixon to accompany them to an attorney\u2019s office for a meeting about selling property to the Gists, at which meeting Dixon was told she had to sign a document \u201cin order to speak with the attorney,\u201d \u201cwas handed a document that was substantially blank,\u201d and was told to sign; the document was the deed to property owned by Dixon, according to her complaint. Dixon alleges that she \u201cremained personally unaware\u201d of the conveyance until June 2010, despite the fact that the Gists had built a home on the conveyed property in 2007.\nAssuming the truth of Dixon\u2019s allegation that she was actually unaware of the conveyance until June 2010, we nevertheless conclude that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations because the allegations presented by the Gists in their answer (supported by attached exhibit evidence) show that, in the exercise of due diligence, Dixon should have discovered the alleged fraud by July 2007. See Piles v. Allstate Ins. Co., 187 N.C. App. 399, 403-04, 653 S.E.2d 181, 185 (2007) (cause of action for fraud accrues when claimant should have discovered the fraud in the exercise of due diligence), disc. review denied, 362 N.C. 361, 663 S.E.2d 316 (2008). The exhibits attached to the Gists\u2019 answer show that Dixon was present at the 16 July 2007 meeting of the Lexington, North Carolina planning board, at which meeting (1) the planning board discussed rezoning the property in question, (2) it was explained to the planning board that the property was owned by the Gists, and (3) it was stated that Dixon \u201cpreviously owned the [property] recently purchased by [the Gists].\u201d In our view, and assuming arguendo that Dixon was actually unaware of the conveyance, Dixon should have discovered that she had conveyed the property to the Gists, and thus, have discovered the alleged fraud, at least by the time of the 16 July 2007 planning board meeting, where Dixon was present for a discussion of the conveyance and the Gists\u2019 ownership of the property. Because Dixon\u2019s initial complaint was filed in September 2010, more than three years after her cause of action accrued in July 2007, we conclude that Dixon\u2019s claims arising from the conveyance of property to the Gists were filed after, the applicable statute of limitations expired and, thus, were properly dismissed.\nHowever, regarding those claims arising from the allegedly fraudulent withdrawal of money from Dixon\u2019s bank account, we conclude that Dixon has sufficiently pled within the statute of limitations claims for (1) constructive fraud based on breach of a fiduciary duty, (2) civil conspiracy, and (3) conversion.\nAs for this first claim, a fiduciary relationship can be found to exist \u201canytime one person reposes a special confidence in another, in which event the one trusted is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the other,\u201d Adams, 96 N.C. App. at 362, 385 S.E.2d at 801, and a claim for constructive fraud based upon a breach of such a relationship is sufficiently pled \u201c.by alleging facts and circumstances (1) which created the relation of trust and confidence, and (2) [which] led up to and surrounded the consummation of the transaction in which defendant is alleged to have taken advantage of his position of trust to the hurt of plaintiff.\u201d Terry, 302 N.C. at 85, 273 S.E.2d at 679 (brackets in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Rhodes, 232 N.C. at 548-49, 61 S.E.2d at 725).\nIn this case, Dixon has alleged that a fiduciary relationship existed between her and the Gists by virtue of the Gists \u201cbecoming joint account holders on [Dixon\u2019s] primary banking account with the purported purpose of helping [Dixon] with her daily necessities and monthly obligations.\u201d Dixon supports this allegation with assertions that (1) the Gists told Dixon that \u201cit would be in her best interest to add them as signatories on her [] bank checking account so that they could make purchases for her with her debit card and/or write checks from her bank account\u201d; (2) the Gists were, in fact, added to Dixon\u2019s account; and (3) the Gists helped take care of Dixon\u2019s \u201cdaily needs\u201d between June 2007 and June 2010. Assuming their truth, as must be done when considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499 (noting that factual alle gations in the nonmoving party\u2019s pleadings are taken as true), these facts alleged by Dixon, along with any permissible favorable inferences, are sufficient at least to raise an issue of fact as to whether a fiduciary relationship existed between the parties with respect to the joint bank account. Cf. Moore v. Bryson, 11 N.C. App. 260, 265, 181 S.E.2d 113, 116 (1971) (holding that there is at least a triable issue regarding the existence of a fiduciary relationship where an \u201cindividual\u201d \u201cundertook to manage and generally control [property] for the benefit of [the property\u2019s co-owners], causing them to repose special faith, confidence and trust in him to represent their best interest with respect to the property\u201d; also holding that \u201cwhile a fiduciary relationship ordinarily does not arise ... from the simple fact of [the parties\u2019] cotenancy, such a relationship may be created by their conduct, as where one cotenant assumes to act for the benefit of his cotenants\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. also HAJMM Co. v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc., 94 N.C. App. 1, 11, 379 S.E.2d 868, 874 (1989) (noting that \u201c[t]he existence of a fiduciary relationship is not contingent upon a technical or legal relationship\u201d), aff\u2019d in part and modified and reversed on other grounds, 328 N.C. 578, 403 S.E.2d 483 (1991). Further, assuming the truth of Dixon\u2019s allegations that, in 2009, the Gists began transferring \u201cthe funds from [Dixon\u2019s] bank account into other accounts in the sole name of the [Gists], ultimately transferring roughly ninety percent [] of [Dixon\u2019s] funds out of her account and into accounts of [the Gists] over which [Dixon] had no control,\u201d we must conclude that Dixon has sufficiently pled facts on her claim that the Gists committed constructive fraud by breaching their fiduciary duty to Dixon. See Forbis, 361 N.C. at 529-30, 649 S.E.2d at 388-89 (holding that where the defendant-fiduciary \u201callegedly divested [the plaintiff-beneficiaries] of almost all their assets\u201d and, therefore, obtained a \u201cbenefit through the alleged abuse of the confidential or fiduciary relationship,\u201d the plaintiff-beneficiaries are entitled to \u201ca presumption that constructive fraud occurred\u201d). As Dixon\u2019s complaint sufficiently asserted a claim for constructive fraud based upon a breach of fiduciary duty within the applicable statute of limitations, dismissal of that claim, as well as dismissal of the related claim of civil conspiracy to commit constructive fraud, was improper.\nWe likewise conclude that, based on the above-discussed allegations, Dixon\u2019s conversion claim, along with its related civil conspiracy claim, arising from the Gists\u2019 alleged unlawful transfers of money from Dixon\u2019s bank account beginning in 2009 was (1) sufficiently pled, and (2) asserted within the applicable statute of limitations. See Stratton v. Royal Bank of Can., _ N.C. App. _, _, 712 S.E.2d 221, 227 (2011) (\u201cA conversion is an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the . . . exclusion of an owner\u2019s rights. Conversion claims are subject to a three-year limitation period under [section 1-52(4)].\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-52(4). This is so despite the Gists\u2019 allegation that Dixon confirmed that the Gists had none of Dixon\u2019s property or money in June 2010\u2014which allegation contradicts various allegations in Dixon\u2019s complaint and is, thus, assumed to be untrue. Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499 (\u201cAll well pleaded factual allegations in the nonmoving party\u2019s pleadings are taken as true and all contravening assertions in the movant\u2019s pleadings are taken as false.\u201d).\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Dixon\u2019s claims for constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, and conversion related to the Gists\u2019 alleged improper withdrawal of money from Dixon\u2019s account. However, we hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing those claims arising from Dixon\u2019s allegedly fraud-induced conveyance of real property to the Gists, i.e., the related claims for fraud, civil conspiracy, undue influence, and declaratory judgment. Further, because we are reversing a portion of the trial court\u2019s order dismissing Dixon\u2019s complaint, we vacate the court\u2019s order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees based on the trial court\u2019s conclusion that all of Dixon\u2019s claims were frivolous, but instruct the court that it may reconsider the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in light of our holding and any future determinations by the trial court regarding the merits of Dixon\u2019s surviving claims.\nAFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part; VACATED in part.\nChief Judge MARTIN and Judge HUNTER, ROBERT C. concur.\n. We note that the statute of limitations for the constructive fraud claim regarding the withdrawal of money from Dixon\u2019s account is subject to a ten-year statute of limitations. Adams v. Moore, 96 N.C. App. 359, 362, 385 S.E.2d 799, 801 (1989) (noting that \u201cthe ten-year statute of limitations under [N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7] 1-56 applies to constructive fraud claims based upon a breach of fiduciary duty\u201d (emphasis in original)), disc. review denied, 326 N.C. 46, 389 S.E.2d 83 (1990); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-56 (2011). This ten-year statute of limitations does not apply to the claims arising from the allegedly fraud-induced conveyance of property because those claims are for actual fraud based on specific misrepresentations rather than constructive fraud based on the abuse of a confidential relationship. Forbis v. Neal, 361 N.C. 519, 528-29, 649 S.E.2d 382, 388 (2007) (noting that constructive fraud differs from actual fraud in that it is based on a confidential relationship rather than a specific misrepresentation). Although Dixon labels those claims as claims arising from constructive fraud, the crux of the claims is that the Gists misrepresented the purpose of the meeting with the attorney and the nature of the \u201csubstantially blank\u201d document that Dixon was required to sign. See Terry v. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 84, 273 S.E.2d 674, 678 (1981) (limiting analysis of claim to constructive fraud where \u201c[t]he gist of the complaint\" was constructive fraud rather than actual fraud); see also Stanback v. Stanback, 297 N.C. 181, 202, 264 S.E.2d 611, 625 (1979) (holding that in determining the sufficiency of a claim, the focus is on the \u201cwrong complained of\u2019 not the \u201cincorrect choice of legal theory\u201d). Unlike Dixon\u2019s fraudulent withdrawal claims, which, as discussed infra, allege facts and circumstances showing a fiduciary relationship established between the parties by the Gists\u2019 \u201cbecoming joint account holders on [Dixon\u2019s] primary banking account,\u201d Dixon\u2019s fraud-induced conveyance claims do not allege, beyond vague averments of trust and confidence, the existence of some other fiduciary relationship between Dixon and the Gists and the abuse of that relationship by the Gists in procuring the conveyance. Cf. Terry, 302 N.C. at 83, 273 S.E.2d at 677 (in stating a cause of action for breach of a fiduciary relationship, \u201cit is not sufficient for [a] plaintiff to allege merely that [the] defendant had won his trust and confidence and occupied a position of dominant influence over him\u201d (quoting Rhodes v. Jones, 232 N.C. 547, 548-49, 61 S.E.2d 725, 725 (1950))). As the fraud-induced conveyance claims only sufficiently allege actual fraud, the three-year statute of limitations of section 1-52(9) applies to those claims.", "author": "STEPHENS, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["ELIZABETH DIXON, Plaintiff v.

Appeal and Error\u2014preservation of issues\u2014failure to timely object\nAlthough defendant Taylor contended the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs even though the motion was allegedly untimely, defendant waived this issue by failing to appear and object at the time the trial court considered the motion.\n2. Pleadings\u2014failure to answer or object\u2014requests deemed admitted\nThe trial court did not err by granting summary judgment against defendant Taylor because he failed to answer or otherwise object to any of the requests. Consequently, each of plaintiffs\u2019 requests were deemed admitted, and defendant\u2019s admissions sufficiently established each element of defamation per se, appropriation, and unfair and deceptive practices.\n3. Constitutional Law\u2014right to jury trial\u2014waiver\u2014failure to appear\nThe trial court did not err by conducting a bench trial to determine plaintiffs\u2019 damages even though defendant Taylor specifically demanded a jury trial in his answer. Since defendant did not appear at trial, he waived his right to a jury trial.\n4. Damages and Remedies\u2014compensatory damages\u2014amount\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in a defamation per se, appropriation, and unfair and deceptive practices case by awarding one million dollars in compensatory damages to each plaintiff police officer. Defendant Taylor\u2019s action of creating a heavily edited version of a video recording making it appear as though defendant was wrongfully arrested caused plaintiffs significant harm in their personal lives and in their careers as police officers, this harm will continue throughout the remainder of plaintiffs\u2019 careers, and defendant profited from the harm he caused plaintiffs in an amount exceeding ten million dollars.\n5. Damages and Remedies\u2014punitive damages\u2014aggravating factors\u2014standard of proof\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in a defamation per se, appropriation, and unfair and deceptive practices case by awarding each plaintiff two million dollars in punitive damages from defendant Taylor. However, while the trial court\u2019s judgment concluded, based upon defendant\u2019s admission, that he acted with actual malice and personal ill will toward plaintiffs, it failed to state whether this finding of an aggravating factor was by clear and convincing evidence as required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1D-I5(b). The judgment was remanded to the trial court to consider whether the evidence of that aggravating factor met the required standard of proof, and so that the judgment could be amended to reflect its determination on this issue.\n6. Attorney Fees\u2014unfair trade practices\u2014sufficient findings of fact\nThe trial court\u2019s judgment included sufficient findings of fact to support its conclusion of law that defendant Taylor was liable for unfair and deceptive practices, which permitted the trial court to award attorney fees under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 75-1.1.\n7. Judgments\u2014motion to set aside entry of default\u2014agreement for extension of time\u2014failure to file answer\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to set aside entiy of default against defendant B\u00fangalo. Although defendant, due to an agreement with plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, was granted an extension of time, an answer was never filed. Further, plaintiffs then waited an additional three weeks to file a motion for entry of default.\n8. Damages and Remedies\u2014punitive damages\u2014improper use of co-defendants\u2019 admissions\nThe trial court erred by its punitive damages award. The trial court improperly used the admissions of defendant\u2019s co-defendants regarding profits and ability to pay to determine the amount of punitive damages to award against defendant. Defendant\u2019s failure to participate in the instant case did not relieve plaintiffs of their burden to prove their damages. Defendant was granted a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.\nAppeal by defendants Jayceon Taylor and B\u00fangalo Records, Inc. from judgment entered 20 September 2010 by Judge A. Moses Massey in Guilford County Superior Court. Heard in the Court of Appeals 11 October 2011.\nCranfill Sumner & Hartzog LLP, by Dan M. Hartzog and Dan M. Hartzog Jr., for plaintiff-appellees.\nOsborne Law Firm, P.C., by Curtis C. Osborne, for defendant-appellant Jayceon Taylor.\nBlanco Tackaberry & Matamoros, P.A., by Peter J. Juran, for defendant-appellant B\u00fangalo Records, Inc.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "CALABRIA, Judge.\nJayceon Taylor (\u201cTaylor\u201d) and B\u00fangalo Records, Inc. (\u201cBungalo\u201d) appeal the trial court\u2019s judgment which, following a bench trial, awarded five million dollars in compensatory damages and ten million dollars in punitive damages to Hien Nguyen, Matthew Brown, Ryan Childrey, Romaine Watkins, and David Gregory (collectively \u201cplaintiffs\u201d). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\nThe events which led to the filing of the instant case have previously been chronicled by this Court in Nguyen v. Taylor, 200 N.C. App. 387, 684 S.E.2d 470 (2009)(\u201cNguyen I\u201d). The factual and procedural history relevant to the instant appeal is as follows: On 28 October 2005, plaintiffs, who were officers with the Greensboro Police Department, arrested Taylor at the Four Seasons Mall in Greensboro, North Carolina and charged him with criminal trespass, communicating threats, and disorderly conduct. An individual in Taylor\u2019s entourage recorded the arrest with a video camera. A heavily edited version of that video recording, which made it appear as though Taylor was wrongfully arrested, was included as a bonus feature on a documentary DVD released by Taylor and others, entitled \u201cStop Snitchin\u2019 Stop Lyin\u2019 \u201d (\u201cthe DVD\u201d). B\u00fangalo was involved in the production of the DVD and also provided internet marketing services for it.\nOn 30 October 2006, plaintiffs filed a complaint against Taylor, B\u00fangalo, Engel Thedford, Michael Kimbrew, DJ Skee, Anthony Torres, Black Wall Street Records, LLC, Black Wall Street Publishing, LLC, General GFX, Grind Music, Inc., Jump Off Films, Liberation Entertainment, Inc., John Doe #2, www.stopsnitchinstoplyin.com, Universal Home Video, Inc., and Youtube, Inc. The complaint included claims against Taylor, individually, for a statement he allegedly made to the news media after his arrest. It also included claims against Taylor, B\u00fangalo, and other defendants for defamation, wrongful appropriation of a likeness, and unfair and deceptive practices. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were based upon (1) the edited footage of Taylor\u2019s arrest contained in the DVD; (2) a description on the back of the DVD case which stated that it included the \u201c[e]ntire footage of [Taylor] being wrongfully arrested in North Carolina; and (3) a statement on the website Yvww.stopsnitchinstoplyin.com which referred to the video of the arrest as the \u201c[e]ntire footage of [Taylor] being wrongfully arrested and brutalized by the Police in North Carolina.\u201d\nB\u00fangalo was served with plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on 10 November 2006. Bungalo\u2019s counsel then contacted plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, who agreed to extend the time to file a responsive pleading until 2 January 2007. However, B\u00fangalo failed to file an answer. As a result, plaintiffs filed a motion for default on 23 January 2007, and on 24 January 2007, default was entered against B\u00fangalo by the Guilford County Clerk of Superior Court. On 30 January 2007, Bungalo\u2019s counsel contacted plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in an attempt to have the default set aside, but plaintiffs\u2019 counsel refused. On 21 March 2007, B\u00fangalo filed a motion to have the default set aside, and the motion was denied by Judge Edwin G. Wilson, Jr. on 21 May 2007. On 30 November 2007, plaintiffs sent discovery requests to B\u00fangalo, but B\u00fangalo refused to comply with the requests on the basis of the default.\nOn 18 June 2008, Taylor and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. On 5 August 2008, the trial court entered an order which granted defendants\u2019 motion in part and denied it in part. After the entry of this order, the remaining claims against Taylor were (1) defamation, based upon the edited footage contained in the DVD; (2) appropriation; and (3) unfair and deceptive practices. Plaintiffs appealed the trial court\u2019s order. On 20 October 2009, this Court, in Nguyen I, dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 appeal as interlocutory.\nWhile plaintiffs\u2019 appeal was pending, the trial court entered a stay of all proceedings. On 18 December 2009, plaintiffs sent Taylor \u201cRequests for Admission,\u201d and Taylor did not respond as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 36 (2011).\nPlaintiffs voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, their claims against Universal Home Video, Inc., and Youtube, Inc. In addition, plaintiffs reached a settlement and voluntarily dismissed their claims against DJ Skee.\nThe case was set for trial on 13 September 2010. On 23 August 2010, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment against Taylor on the basis of his failure to respond to the requests for admission. The motion was heard on the day of trial. Taylor did not appear. The trial court entered summary judgment against Taylor and proceeded to trial on the issue of damages.\nThe bench trial on damages was conducted on 14 September 2010. At trial, each plaintiff testified regarding the negative effects of the DVD. They testified that people consistently recognized them as a result of appearing in the DVD and explained the problems this created. These included, inter alia, problems with their jobs and their fear for their own safety and for the safety of their families. On 20 September 2010, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of plaintiffs against Taylor, B\u00fangalo, Engel Thedford, Michael Kimbrew, Anthony Torres, Black Wall Street Records, LLC, Black Wall Street Publishing, LLC, General GFX, Grind Music, Inc., and Jump Off Films. Plaintiffs were each awarded one million dollars in compensatory damages and two million dollars in punitive damages. The defendants involved in this judgment were jointly and severally liable for the damages awarded.\nPlaintiffs subsequently voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, their claims against the defendants who remained after the 20 September 2010 judgment: John Doe #2, www.stopsnitchinstoplyin.com, and Liberation Entertainment, Inc.\nTaylor and B\u00fangalo were the only defendants to file notice of appeal.\nII. Jacevon Tavlor\nTaylor raises numerous issues on appeal. He argues: (1) that the trial court erred by holding a summary judgment hearing on the day of trial; (2) that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to plaintiffs against Taylor; (3) that the trial court erred by conducting a bench trial to determine damages, when Taylor had demanded a jury trial; (4) that the trial court erred by relying upon unanswered requests for admission to determine plaintiffs\u2019 damages; (5) that the trial court\u2019s findings were insufficient to support its verdict, because the findings did not indicate which tort gave rise to which damages; (6) that the trial court erred in awarding five million dollars in compensatory damages to plaintiffs, as these damages were not supported by competent evidence; (7) that the trial court erred in awarding punitive damages; and (8) that the trial court erred by awarding plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees.\nA. Timing of Summary Judgment Motion\nTaylor first argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to plaintiffs because plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion was untimely. Specifically, Taylor contends that plaintiffs failed to comply with a pretrial administrative scheduling order entered in the case that required plaintiffs to file their motion 14 days prior to trial. We disagree.\nAlthough Taylor was properly served with plaintiffs\u2019 motion, he failed to appear at the summary judgment hearing. Since he was not in court, he did not object at the time the trial court considered the motion. Accordingly, he has waived appellate review of this issue. See N.C.R. App. P. 10(a)(1) (2011)(\u201cIn order to preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection, or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context.\u201d). This argument is overruled.\nB. Evidence Supporting Summary Judgment\nTaylor next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment against him. We disagree.\nSummary judgment shall be rendered \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2011). In the instant case, the trial court properly relied upon Taylor\u2019s admissions in granting summary judgment to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sent Taylor requests for admission pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 36 (2011). This rule provides, in relevant part:\nEach matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or by his attorney, but, unless the court shortens the time, a defendant shall not be required to serve answers or objections before the expiration of 60 days after service of the summons and complaint upon him.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 36(a). After Taylor was served with plaintiffs\u2019 requests for admission, he failed to answer or otherwise object to any of the requests. Consequently, each of plaintiffs\u2019 requests were deemed admitted.\nOur Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[f]acts that are admitted under Rule 36(b) are sufficient to support a grant of summary judg ment.\u201d Goins v. Puleo, 350 N.C. 277, 280, 512 S.E.2d 748, 750 (1999). In the instant case, Taylor\u2019s admissions sufficiently established each element of defamation per se, appropriation, and unfair and deceptive practices.\n1. Defamation Per Se\nIn general, \u201c[t]o be actionable, a defamatory statement must be false and must be communicated to a person or persons other than the person defamed.\u201d Andrews v. Elliot, 109 N.C. App. 271, 274, 426 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1993). Moreover,\nNorth Carolina has long recognized the harm that can result from false statements that impeach a person in that person\u2019s trade or profession \u2014 such statements are deemed defamation per se. The mere saying or writing of the words is presumed to cause injury to the subject; there is no need to prove any actual injury.\nCohen v. McLawhorn, _ N.C. App. _, _, 704 S.E.2d 519, 527 (2010)(internal quotations and citations omitted). In the instant case, Taylor admitted that the DVD was edited to give the impression that he did nothing wrong during his arrest, in an attempt to defame plaintiffs. Taylor additionally admitted that the edited footage \u201cwas intentionally misleading\u201d and that he intended to \u201ccharacterize the Plaintiffs\u2019 actions [in arresting him] as illegal\u201d even though he \u201cknew the Plaintiffs\u2019 actions were legal.\u201d Finally, Taylor admitted that he intended to \u201cdefame the Plaintiffs with the DVD,\u201d and that he intended to \u201cinjure the Plaintiffs in their trades or professions.\u201d Based upon these admissions, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on their defamation per se claim.\n2. Appropriation\nNorth Carolina recognizes a claim for invasion of privacy by means of \u201cappropriation, for the defendant\u2019s advantage, of the plaintiff\u2019s name or likeness[.]\u201d Renwick v. News and Observer and Renwick v. Greensboro News, 310 N.C. 312, 322, 312 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1984). In the instant case, Taylor admitted that he appropriated plaintiffs\u2019 likenesses for his own advantage. As a result, the trial court properly granted plaintiffs summary judgment on their appropriation claim against Taylor.\n3. Unfair or Deceptive Practices\n\u201cThe elements of a claim for unfair or deceptive [] practices in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 (2003) are: (1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of competition; (2) in or affecting commerce; (3) that proximately causes actual injury to the plaintiff or to his business.\u201d RD&J Props. v. Lauralea-Dilton Enters., LLC, 165 N.C. App. 737, 748, 600 S.E.2d 492, 500 (2004). In the instant case, Taylor admitted that the DVD \u201cwas commercially released for worldwide distribution\u201d and that he was \u201cinvolved in all aspects of the filming, editing, directing, producing, and financing, and distribution of the DVD.\u201d He also admitted that he \u201cma[de] [plaintiffs] unwitting performers in [his] commercial DVD\u201d and \u201cdefam[ed] [plaintiffs] while profiting at their expense.\u201d In addition, he admitted that the use of plaintiffs in the DVD directly increased the DVD sales. Based upon these admissions, the trial court properly granted plaintiffs summary judgment against Taylor on their unfair and deceptive practices claim.\nTaylor\u2019s admissions were sufficient to establish each of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against him. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting plaintiffs summary judgment against Taylor on their claims for defamation per se, appropriation, and unfair and deceptive practices. This argument is overruled.\nC. Demand for Jury Trial\nTaylor argues that the trial court erred by conducting a bench trial to determine plaintiffs\u2019 damages when Taylor specifically demanded a jury trial in his answer. However, \u201c[a] party may waive his right to jury trial by . . . failing to appear at the trial[.]\u201d Carolina Forest Ass\u2019n v. White, 198 N.C. App. 1, 16, 678 S.E.2d 725, 735 (2009). Since Taylor did not appear at trial, he waived his right to a jury trial. This argument is overruled.\nD. Compensatory Damages\nTaylor argues that, for a variety of reasons, the trial court\u2019s award of compensatory damages was erroneous. We disagree.\n1. Division of Damages\nTaylor first argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment was inherently deficient because it failed to specify which portion of its damages award was attributable to each of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. However, Taylor fails to cite any authority in support of this argument, and so it is deemed abandoned pursuant to N.C.R. App. R 28 (b)(6) (2011).\n2. Use of Admissions\nTaylor also contends that the trial court erred by using Taylor\u2019s admissions to make its findings of fact. As previously noted, Taylor failed to respond to plaintiffs\u2019 requests for admission, and as a result, all of plaintiffs\u2019 requests were deemed admitted under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 36(a). \u201cAny matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 36(b). This Court has explained that an admission under Rule 36 \u201cis not evidence, but it, instead, serves to remove the admitted fact from the trial by formally conceding its existence.\u201d J.M. Parker & Sons, Inc. v. William Barber, Inc., _ N.C. App. _, _, 704 S.E.2d 64, 69 (2010) (internal quotations and citation omitted).\nIn the instant case, plaintiffs entered Taylor\u2019s admissions into evidence during the damages trial. Consequently, the admissions were conclusively established facts for purposes of that trial. Thus, the trial court did not err by making findings of fact based upon Taylor\u2019s admissions. This argument is overruled.\n3. Award of Consequential Damages\nTaylor next contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s award of one million dollars in compensatory damages per plaintiff. \u201cThe burden of proving damages is on the party seeking them. As part of its burden, the party seeking damages must show that the amount of damages is based upon a standard that will allow the finder of fact to calculate the amount of damages with reasonable certainty.\u201d Olivetti Corp. v. Ames Business Systems, Inc., 319 N.C. 534, 547-48, 356 S.E.2d 578, 586 (1987) (internal citation omitted). In the instant case, Taylor was found liable for defamation per se, appropriation, and unfair and deceptive practices.\nFor a defamation claim, \u201c[compensatory damages include (1) pecuniary loss direct or indirect, i.e., special damages; (2) damages for physical pain and inconvenience; (3) damages for mental suffering; and (4) damages for injury to reputation.\u201d Roth v. News Co., 217 N.C. 13, 23, 6 S.E.2d 882, 889 (1940)(internal quotations and citations omitted). While our Courts have not precisely defined the measure of damages for an appropriation claim, the Restatement (Second) of Torts identifies the following types of damages for all invasion of privacy actions:\n(a) the harm to [the plaintiffs] interest in privacy resulting from the invasion;\n(b) [the plaintiff\u2019s] mental distress proved to have been suffered if it is of a kind that normally results from such an invasion; and\n(c) special damage of which the invasion is a legal cause.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 652H. For the harm specific to the tort of appropriation, the Restatement notes that \u201c[o]ne whose name, likeness or identity is appropriated to the use of another . . . may recover for the loss of the exclusive use of the value so appropriated.\u201d Id., cmt. (a). Finally, for an unfair or deceptive practices claim, this Court has stated:\nUnfair and deceptive trade practices and unfair competition claims are neither wholly tortious nor wholly contractual in nature and the measure of damages is broader than common law actions. The measure of damages used should further the purpose of awarding damages, which is to restore the victim to his original condition, to give back to him that which was lost as far as it may be done by compensation in money.\nRichardson v. Bank of Am., N.A., 182 N.C. App. 531, 562, 643 S.E.2d 410, 429 (2007)(internal quotations and citations omitted).\nThe damages in the instant case were awarded after a bench trial. \u201cIn a bench trial in which the [trial] court sits without a jury, the standard of review is whether there was competent evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and whether its conclusions of law were proper in light of such facts.\u201d Hinnant v. Philips, 184 N.C. App. 241, 245, 645 S.E.2d 867, 870 (2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s award of damages at a bench trial is a matter within its sound discretion, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Helms v. Schultze, 161 N.C. App. 404, 414, 588 S.E.2d 524, 530 (2003).\nThe trial court made the following relevant findings of fact regarding plaintiffs\u2019 damages:\n37. As a result of Defendants\u2019 actions, Plaintiffs have been substantially injured. The Plaintiffs are consistently recognized as being the officers who arrested [Taylor]. They are often accused of racism by those who recognize them as a result of the DVD, which undermines their authority as police officers. They have legitimate fears for their own safety, as well as for the safety of their families.\n39. The DVD and the statements made by the Defendants continue to be widely available across the world, and the footage remains readily available on the internet. As a result, it is likely that the Plaintiffs will continue to be damaged by these materials wherever they go and for the remainder of their careers.\nTaylor did not challenge these findings, and thus, they are binding on appeal. See Koufman v. Koufman, 330 N.C. 93, 97, 408 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1991). In addition, based upon Taylor\u2019s admissions, the trial court found that \u201cTaylor . . . made in excess of TEN MILLION DOLLARS ($10,000,000.00) in profits on the sale of the DVD, the vast majority of which [he] attribute [d] to the use of Plaintiffs\u2019 likeness [es] and the defamatory statements.\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s binding findings of fact are that Taylor\u2019s actions have caused plaintiffs significant harm in their personal lives and in their careers as police officers, that this harm will continue throughout the remainder of plaintiffs\u2019 careers, and that Taylor profited from the harm he caused plaintiffs in an amount exceeding ten million dollars. In light of these findings, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion by awarding each plaintiff one million dollars in compensatory damages. This argument is overruled.\nE. Punitive Damages\nTaylor next argues that the trial court erred in awarding each plaintiff two million dollars in punitive damages.\nUnder N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1D-I5(a) (2009), \u201c[p]unitive damages may be awarded only if the claimant proves that the defendant is liable for compensatory damages and that one of the following aggravating factors was present and was related to the injury for which compensatory damages were awarded: (1) Fraud[;] (2) Malice[; or] (3) Willful or wanton conduct.\u201d The plaintiff \u201cmust prove the existence of an aggravating factor by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1D-I5(b).\nSprings v. City of Charlotte, _ N.C. App. _, _, 704 S.E.2d 319, 325-26 (2011). In the instant case, Taylor admitted that he \u201chad personal ill-will and malice towards each of the Plaintiffs in this action and that this ill-will and malice motivated [his] actions.\u201d Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 36(b), Taylor\u2019s admission conclusively established and formally conceded the existence of an aggravating factor. J.M. Parker & Sons, _ N.C. App. at _, 704 S.E.2d at 69.\nHowever, while the trial court\u2019s judgment concluded, based upon Taylor\u2019s admission, that he \u201cacted with actual malice and personal ill will towards the Plaintiffs,\u201d it failed to state whether this finding of an aggravating factor was by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d as required by N.C, Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1D-I5(b). As a result, we must remand the judgment to the trial court so that it may consider whether the evidence of that aggravating factor met the required standard of proof, and so that the judgment may be amended to reflect its determination on this issue.\nTaylor additionally contends that, even if punitive damages were appropriate, the amount of punitive damages awarded by the trial court constituted an abuse of discretion.\nIn determining the amount of punitive damages, if any, to be awarded, the trier of fact:\n(1) Shall consider the purposes of punitive damages set forth in G.S. ID-1; and\n(2) May consider only that evidence that relates to the following:\na. The reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s motives and conduct.\nb. The likelihood, at the relevant time, of serious harm.\nc. The degree of the defendant\u2019s awareness of the probable consequences of its conduct.\nd. The duration of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\ne. The actual damages suffered by the claimant.\nf. Any concealment by the defendant of the facts or consequences of its conduct.\ng. The existence and frequency of any similar past conduct by the defendant.\nh. Whether the defendant profited from the conduct.\ni. The defendant\u2019s ability to pay punitive damages, as evidenced by its revenues or net worth.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 ID-35 (2011). In the instant case, the trial court\u2019s judgment specifically indicated that it had considered the purpose of punitive damages. In addition, the judgment concluded that \u201cDefendants\u2019 conduct and motives . . . were reprehensible,\u201d that \u201cthe Defendants either were or should have been aware of the likelihood of serious harm to the Plaintiffs,\u201d and that \u201cthe Defendants made in excess of FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ($40,000,000) from the DVD, and have the ability to pay the punitive damages awarded.\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s judgment complied with N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 ID-35 in determining the punitive damages award, and we find no abuse of discretion in the amount awarded. This argument is overruled.\nF. Attorneys\u2019 Fees\nFinally, Taylor argues that the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees. Specifically, Taylor contends that there are no findings included in the trial court\u2019s judgment that Taylor\u2019s actions affected commerce, and without these findings the judgment failed to establish Taylor\u2019s liability for unfair or deceptive practices. Contrary to Taylor\u2019s assertion, the trial court specifically found as fact that the DVD which defamed plaintiffs was commercially released. The trial court\u2019s judgment included sufficient findings of fact to support its conclusion of law that Taylor was liable for unfair and deceptive practices, which permitted the trial court to award attorneys\u2019 fees under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 (2011). This argument is overruled.\nIII. B\u00fangalo Records. Inc.\nB\u00fangalo raises two issues on appeal. First, B\u00fangalo argues that the trial court erred by denying Bungalo\u2019s motion to set aside the entry of default. Second, B\u00fangalo argues that the trial court erred by awarding plaintiffs a fifteen mill\u00f3n dollar judgment against B\u00fangalo.\nA. Entry of Default\nB\u00fangalo contends that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to set aside the entry of default. We disagree.\nAn entry of default may be set aside for \u2018good cause shown. Williams v. Jennette, 77 N.C. App. 283, 287, 335 S.E.2d 191, 194 (1985). \u201cWhether \u2018good cause\u2019 exists depends on the facts and circumstances of each particular case, and the trial court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown.\u201d Old Salem Foreign Car Serv., Inc. v. Webb, 159 N.C. App. 93, 97, 582 S.E.2d 673, 676 (2003). \u201cThe defendant carries the burden of showing good cause to set aside entry of default.\u201d Luke v. Omega Consulting Grp., LC, 194 N.C. App. 745, 748, 670 S.E.2d 604, 607 (2009).\nIn its brief, B\u00fangalo contends that its \u201cfailure to answer was inadvertent, due to a conversation in which [Bungalo\u2019s counsel] mistakenly believed that Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel agreed to an extension of time in which to file an answer.\u201d However, the conversation referenced by B\u00fangalo did not occur until 30 January 2007, after default had been entered. Thus, this conversation could not provide a basis for setting aside the default.\nB\u00fangalo was served with plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on 10 November 2006. Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, an answer is due within 30 days of service of a complaint. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(a)(1) (2011). Although B\u00fangalo, due to an agreement with plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, was granted an extension of time until 2 January 2007, an answer was never filed. Plaintiffs then waited an additional three weeks, until 23 January 2007, to file a motion for entry of default. Thereafter, B\u00fangalo did not file its motion to set aside the default until 21 March 2007. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of Bungalo\u2019s motion to set aside default. This argument is overruled.\nB. Judgment\nB\u00fangalo argues that the evidence presented at the damages trial did not support an award of fifteen million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages against B\u00fangalo. We agree that the punitive damages award against B\u00fangalo was improper, and grant B\u00fangalo a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.\n1. Bungalo\u2019s Liability\nB\u00fangalo first argues that because it was not mentioned by name during the evidentiary portion of the damages trial, plaintiffs failed to establish that Bungalo\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of their damages. We disagree.\n\u201cThe effect of an entry of default is that the defendant against whom entry of default is made is deemed to have admitted the allegations in plaintiff\u2019s complaint and is prohibited from defending on the merits of the case.\u201d Spartan Leasing v. Pollard, 101 N.C. App. 450, 460, 400 S.E.2d 476, 482 (1991)(internal citation omitted). Thus, as a result of the entry of default against B\u00fangalo, all of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against B\u00fangalo were deemed to have been admitted. These included allegations that B\u00fangalo was involved in the production and distribution of the DVD which caused the harm to plaintiffs.\nThe sole purpose of the damages trial was to determine the harm to plaintiffs caused by the production and distribution of the DVD. Since B\u00fangalo admitted, by virtue of its default, its involvement in this process, any damages proven at the trial would be attributable to B\u00fangalo as well as the other defendants who were also involved with the DVD. The fact that B\u00fangalo was not mentioned specifically by name during the damages trial did not affect its responsibility for the amount of damages that were established at the damages trial. All of the defendants who were involved with the DVD, including B\u00fangalo, proximately caused plaintiffs\u2019 damages. This argument is overruled.\n2. Disclaimer on DVD\nB\u00fangalo next argues that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to reduce the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 damages attributable to B\u00fangalo. Specifically, B\u00fangalo contends that a disclaimer mentioned on the DVD, which stated that B\u00fangalo \u201cdisclaims all liability of any kind arising out of the content, comments, and the information contained and referenced within the DVD,\u201d should have reduced the amount of its liability for plaintiffs\u2019 damages.\nOnce default was entered against B\u00fangalo, it had \u201cno further standing to contest the merits of plaintiffs\u2019] right to recover. [Its] only recourse [wa]s ... to contest the amount of the recovery.\u201d Spartan Leasing, 101 N.C. App. at 460, 400 S.E.2d at 482. Contrary to Bungalo\u2019s assertions to the contrary, the disclaimer is relevant only to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against B\u00fangalo; it does not affect the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 damages which were attributable to the DVD. This argument is overruled.\n3. Rule 9(k)\nB\u00fangalo argues that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was legally insufficient to support an award of punitive damages because it did not comply with N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 9(k) (2011). This rule requires, inter alia, that \u201cthe aggravating factor that supports the award of punitive damages shall be averred with particularity.\u201d Id.\nIn the instant case, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not specifically allege malice as an aggravating factor supporting the award of punitive damages. However, this Court has previously held that a com plaint which included an allegation of defamation per se, together with an allegation that the defendant made a statement \u201cwith knowledge that the statement was false,\u201d and a demand for punitive damages, .met the Rule 9(k) particularity requirement. Ausley v. Bishop, 150 N.C. App. 56, 64-65, 564 S.E.2d 252, 258, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 356 N.C. 422, 572 S.E.2d 153 (2002)(per curiam). The allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint cannot be materially distinguished from the complaint in Ausley. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sufficiently complied with the requirements of Rule 9(k). This argument is overruled.\n4. Punitive Damages\nFinally, B\u00fangalo argues that the evidence presented at the damages trial was insufficient to support an award of punitive damages. As previously noted, the trial court\u2019s judgment indicates that it awarded punitive damages because (1) \u201cDefendants\u2019 conduct and motives . . . were reprehensible;\u201d (2) \u201cthe Defendants either were or should have been aware of the likelihood of serious harm to the Plaintiffs;\u201d and (3) \u201cthe Defendants made in excess of FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ($40,000,000) from the DVD, and have the ability to pay the punitive damages awarded.\u201d\nThe allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, which were deemed admitted as a consequence of Bungalo\u2019s default, supported the first two factors considered by the trial court. However, the trial court improperly considered evidence of Bungalo\u2019s co-defendants\u2019 profits and ability to pay punitive damages when it awarded punitive damages against B\u00fangalo. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendants made in excess of forty million dollars from the DVD was based solely upon the admissions of Taylor, Black Wall Street Records, LLC, Black Wall Street Publishing, LLC, and Jump Off Films. This Court has long held that \u201c[f]acts admitted by one defendant are not binding on a co-defendant.\u201d Barclays American v. Haywood, 65 N.C. App. 387, 389, 308 S.E.2d 921, 923 (1983). Thus, the trial court improperly used the admissions of Bungalo\u2019s co-defendants to determine the amount of punitive damages to award against Bungalo.\nMoreover, under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1D-35(2), the trier of fact \u201c[m]ay consider only that evidence that relates to[,]\u201d inter alia, \u201c[w]hether the defendant profited from the conduct\u201d and \u201cf t]he defendant\u2019s ability to pay punitive damages, as evidenced by its revenues or net worth.\u201d (Emphasis added). This statute does not permit the trier of fact to solely consider the co-defendants\u2019 profits and ability to pay when awarding punitive damages against a particular defendant. Since the trial court\u2019s judgment reflects that this is precisely what occurred in the instant case, we must vacate the portion of the judgment awarding punitive damages against B\u00fangalo and remand for a new trial on that issue.\nPlaintiffs concede that they presented no evidence of Bungalo\u2019s profits or its ability to pay punitive damages. They attribute this failure to Bungalo\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to provide information requested in discovery about its ability to pay\u201d and Bungalo\u2019s \u201crefusal to participate in the lawsuit.\u201d However, Bungalo\u2019s failure to participate in the instant case does not relieve plaintiffs of their burden to prove their damages. The Rules of Civil Procedure provide the appropriate methods and remedies by which to address Bungalo\u2019s failure to provide any required discovery materials. These remedies do not include allowing the trier of fact to assume facts which are not presented as evidence. On remand, plaintiffs are free to utilize the relevant discovery rules to obtain the information they seek.\nIV. Conclusion\nBy failing to appear, Taylor waived his ability to contest the timing of the summary judgment hearing and waived his right to a jury trial on damages. The trial court properly granted plaintiffs summary judgment against Taylor for their claims of defamation per se, appropriation, and unfair or deceptive practices. At the damages trial, the court properly considered unanswered requests for admissions. By operation of Rule 36 these requests became conclusively established facts. The trial court\u2019s findings of fact were based upon competent evidence and supported its conclusions of law, which in turn supported its award of compensatory damages against Taylor. However, the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the aggravating factor which supported the award of punitive damages against Taylor failed to indicate that the aggravating factor was established by clear and convincing evidence. We remand the judgment to the trial court so that it may consider whether the evidence of that aggravating factor met the required standard of proof and then amend the judgment to reflect its determination. Nevertheless, assuming an award of punitive damages was proper, the amount of punitive damages awarded did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Finally, the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law established Taylor\u2019s liability for unfair or deceptive practices, and thus, supported the trial court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to set aside Bungalo\u2019s default. The entry of default against B\u00fangalo and the evidence provided by plaintiffs at the damages trial established that B\u00fangalo proximately caused their damages. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding plaintiffs one million dollars each in compensatory damages against B\u00fangalo.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint contained sufficient allegations to comply with the requirements of Rule 9(k) and permitted the trial court to award plaintiffs punitive damages. However, the trial court erred by considering only evidence of Bungalo\u2019s co-defendants\u2019 profits and ability to pay when determining the amount of punitive damages owed by B\u00fangalo. As a result, the portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment which awarded punitive damages against B\u00fangalo is vacated and the case is remanded for a new trial solely on that issue.\nAffirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.\nJudges McGEE and HUNTER, Robert C. concur.\n. The parties have stipulated that \u201c[a]ll documents included [in the record on appeal] were properly filed and served.\u201d This includes plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion.\n. Taylor has not stipulated that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cRequests for Admission\u201d were properly served. However, the requests were.attached to plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, which Taylor stipulated was properly served. As noted above, Taylor did not respond to the summary judgment motion and filed no objections to the requests for admission in response to that motion.\n. The Restatement also notes that for the second and third types of damages, an invasion of privacy action closely parallels a defamation action. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 652H, cmts.

Hood Ellis, for defendants-appellees.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "HUNTER, Robert C., Judge.\nArthur and Elizabeth Taddei (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) appeal from a judgment entered 1 November 2010 granting summary judgment in favor of the Village Creek Property Owners Association, Inc. (\u201cVCPOA\u201d) and VCPOA President Allen E. Renz (\u201cRenz\u201d) (\u201ccollectively defendants\u201d). Plaintiffs argue that the Amended Covenants enacted by the lot owners of Village Creek are invalid; that resubdivision of lots is not permissible in Village Creek; and that plaintiffs produced sufficient evidence of a breach of fiduciary duty by Renz, and, therefore, summary judgment was not appropriate as to that cause of action. After careful review, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\nBackground\nVillage Creek is a residential subdivision located in Chowan County, North Carolina. The subdivision was developed in 1986 by Chowan Storage Company and originally contained 45 lots. A Declaration of Restrictive Covenants for Village Creek was filed on 3 July 1986 and was later modified and amended by the Village Creek Amended Declaration of Restrictive Covenants (\u201cthe Covenants\u201d). Pursuant to Section 23 of the Covenants, which provided for the incorporation of a homeowners association in which all lot owners would be members, the VCPOA was incorporated on 16 April 1987.\nRenz moved to Village Creek in July 2000 and purchased a house one lot away from the Thompson family. Renz and the Thompsons each bought one half of the lot that separated them and then combined each half with their respective lots.\nPlaintiffs moved to Village Creek in September 2002. In 2005, plaintiffs learned that multiple lot owners, like Renz, were only required to pay assessments on a per-unit-owned basis and not on a per-lot-owned basis. In other words, multiple lot owners were only paying dues based on a single lot ownership, even though they technically owned more than one lot. Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the VCPOA and the multiple lot owners, which resulted in entry of a Consent Judgment stating that the Covenants required that assessments be paid on a per-lot-owned basis. Renz had become president of the VCPOA by the time the Consent Judgment was entered.\nOn 2 December 2006, the VCPOA Board of Directors, including Renz in his role as president, sent a letter to lot owners informing them that for the first time in 20 years they had a right to amend the Covenants. Among the areas for possible amendment were the method of assessment and the subdividing of lots. First, the Board made it clear that they felt that the manner in which they were now required to assess fees pursuant to the Consent Judgment was \u201cunfair in terms of value received by the homeowners relative to the expense actually incurred on their behalf by the Association.\u201d Second, the Board acknowledged that the Covenants prohibited the subdivision of lots, but that subdividing had occurred in the past. The VCPOA Board of Directors recommended that the Covenants be amended to \u201cretain the prohibition of building homes on anything less than a full lot,\u201d while simultaneously \u201cvalidat[ing] the legitimacy of previously-combined lots or portions of lots and permit combination of lots or portions of lots in the future . . . .\u201d The letter indicated that a vote of a majority of lot owners was necessary to amend the Covenants. On 6 December 2006, plaintiffs responded with a letter accusing the VCPOA of violating the terms of the Consent Judgment and stating that plaintiffs would challenge any change in the Covenants that were enacted without 100% approval of the property owners.\nDespite plaintiffs\u2019 objections, the VCPOA continued with the covenant amendment process. A special meeting was held in March 2007 where a majority of lot owners consented to and approved the Amended Covenants. The Amended Covenants specified that assessments would be levied on an original platted lot basis and allowed subdivision of lots prospectively. On 4 April 2007, the Amended Covenants were filed with the Chowan County Register of Deeds. On 31 October 2007, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging: (1) breach of contract against VCPOA; (2) a derivative proceeding against VCPOA; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty against Renz. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and, on 1 November 2010, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs in part and in favor of defendants in part. The trial court determined that: (1) the amended covenants were properly adopted; (2) the provisions in the amended covenants changing the manner of making assessments were not reasonable, and, therefore, were invalid; (3) \u201cthe provisions for changes, divisions, or combination of lots\u201d were reasonable and valid; and (4) Renz did not breach his fiduciary duty. The trial court ruled in favor of defendants \u201cas to all other issues regarding the 2007 Amended and Restated Declaration.\u201d\nOn 3 December 2010, plaintiffs appealed from the portions of the judgment that granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Defendants did not appeal.\nStandard of Review\n\u201cOur standard of review of an appeal from summary judgment is de novo; such judgment is appropriate only when the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In re Will of Jones, 362 N.C. 569, 573, 669 S.E.2d 572, 576 (2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\nDiscussion\nI.\nWe first address plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the amendments made to the Covenants are invalid pursuant to Paragraph 33 of the Covenants. Paragraph 33 states:\nNotwithstanding any provision contained herein, Declarant, its successors or assigns, reserves the right to amend, modify or vacate any restriction or covenant herein contained if and only if the restriction or covenant shall be in conflict with an ordinance or other official action by the Town of Edenton and then only to the extent necessary to bring the applicable restriction and covenant into conformity with said ordinance or action of the Town of Edenton.\nThere is no indication that the Amended Covenants approved in 2007 were for this purpose. However, Paragraph 3 of the Covenants states:\nThese covenants and restrictions shall be binding upon the owners and the lands of Village Creek for a period of twenty (20) years from the date of recording of this instrument. They shall be extended automatically for successive periods of ten (10) years unless, prior to the expiration of any term, an instrument executed by the majority of the then owners of lots in Village Creek has been recorded with the Chowan County Register of Deeds revoking or modifying this instrument.\nThis paragraph presents another method by which the Covenants may be modified. Plaintiffs contend that Paragraph 3 is subject to the limitation in Paragraph 33, stating amendments may be made \u201cif and only if the restriction or covenant shall be in conflict with an ordi nance or other official action by the Town of Edenton . . . .\u201d This narrow reading of the Covenants ignores the portion of Paragraph 3 which states that the Covenant\u2019s restrictions may be amended prior to the expiration of any term.\nGenerally, restrictive covenants are contractual in nature and a deed incorporating covenants \u201cimplies the existence of a valid contract with binding restrictions.\u201d Moss Creek Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Bissette, 202 N.C. App. 222, 228, 689 S.E.2d 180, 184 (2010). Restrictive covenants should be strictly construed and any ambiguities should be resolved in favor of the unrestrained use of land. Id. at 228, 689 S.E.2d at 184-85. Nonetheless, effect must be given to the intention of the parties and strict construction may not be used to defeat the plain and obvious meaning of a restriction. Id. at 228, 689 S.E.2d at 185.\nThe plain and unambiguous language in Paragraph 3 of the Covenants states that prior to the expiration of any term, the restrictions in the Covenants may be modified if a majority of lot owners file an instrument with the Chowan County Register of Deeds modifying the Covenants. Here, the Covenants were amended pursuant to the procedure set out in Paragraph 3 prior to the expiration of the first 20-year term and were to be effective at the beginning of the next term.\nThe Amended Covenants, dated 15 March 2007, were signed by a majority of Village Creek lot owners, which satisfies the requirement for modification in Paragraph 3 of the Covenants. These Amended Covenants were then filed with the Chowan County Register of Deeds on 4 April 2007, satisfying the other modification requirement in Paragraph 3. As a result, the Covenants were properly amended, prior to the expiration of the first 20-year term, according to the language of Paragraph 3 quoted above. Consequently, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that the Covenants were lawfully amended based on the language of Paragraph 3.\nII.\nNext, plaintiffs seem to argue that lots should not have been resubdivided prior to 2007 because Paragraph 7 of the original Covenants prohibited resubdivision of lots in Village Creek, particularly with regard to resubdivision by individual owners as opposed to the developer. Paragraph 7 of the Covenants stated the following prior to the 2007 amendment: \u201cNo lots may be resubdivided. Two or more adjacent lots may be made into one lot for one residential structure with the setback above stated to apply to outside, perimeter lot lines of said lots as combined.\u201d Despite the clear language of Paragraph 7, lots in Village Creek were still resubdivided. Between 1989 and 2003, seven of the original lots were resubdivided, the first three of these were resubdivided by the developer, Chowan Storage Company. In 2007, Paragraph 7 of the Covenants was modified to allow for the division and combination of lots subject to some limitations. It is clear that resubdivision of lots going forward is valid so long as it is done pursuant to the methods described in Paragraph 7 of the Amended Covenants.\nPlaintiffs do not argue that the trial court erred in determining that amended Paragraph 7 is valid and reasonable. Plaintiffs appear to be challenging the resubdivision that occurred in violation of the original Covenants prior to 2007. Plaintiffs do not make it clear exactly what remedy they seek with regards to the lots that have already been resubdivided. Plaintiffs\u2019 brief merely makes the argument that Paragraph 7 of the original Covenants did not allowfor lots to be resubdivided, which is likely true but no longer an issue under the Amended Covenants. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint asked the trial court for an \u201corder remedying and setting aside any resubdivision of lots\u201d without alleging a specific claim or cause of action pertaining to the prior resubdivision of lots. The lot owners who resubdivided prior to 2007 were not parties to this action.\nIn sum, neither the plaintiffs\u2019 brief nor their complaint makes it clear what remedy plaintiffs sought with regard to individual lot owners who resubdivided their property under the original Covenants and whose resubdivision is now valid under the Amended Covenants. The trial court did not rule on the validity of prior resub-divisions. As such, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201cthe provision for changes, division or combination of lots in the 2007\u201d Amended Covenants is \u201cvalid\u201d and \u201creasonable.\u201d\nIII.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that sufficient evidence was presented regarding Renz\u2019s alleged breach of his fiduciary duty such that summary judgment was improperly entered in favor of Renz. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that Renz included misleading and false statements in his communications about amending the Covenants because he had a personal economic interest in the outcome. While the debate over amending the Covenants was ongoing, Renz was the president of the VCPOA, which was a non-profit corporation. The duties of directors and officers of a non-profit corporation are set out in the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8 et seq. (2009).\nAccording to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8-30(a) (2009), a director must discharge his duties in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. In doing so, a director may rely on information, opinions, and statements provided by legal counsel or other professionals. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8-30(b)(2). If a director performs his duties in compliance with this statute then he is not liable for any actions taken as director. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8-30(d).\nThe majority of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence regarding this issue consists of statements from letters that Renz sent to Village Creek owners in his role as president of the VCPOA. Plaintiffs contend that Renz did not fully explain the situation in his letters; that he misled lot owners as to the issues; and that he explained matters in a way that would benefit his own economic interests while discounting opposing opinions.\nWhile the allegations made by plaintiffs certainly indicate that plaintiffs and Renz were on separate sides of the issues, they do not establish a genuine issue of material fact. None of the examples suggest that Renz was not acting in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner the director reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation. Indeed, many of the examples cited by plaintiffs highlight the differences of opinion that plaintiffs and Renz had with regard to interpretation of the Covenants and how Village Creek should be run in the future.\nNothing indicates that Renz was not acting in good faith or did not have the best interests of Village Creek in mind when he promoted his point of view. Plaintiffs were not prohibited from sharing their viewpoint, as evidenced by a letter plaintiffs sent to other lot owners expressing concerns and displeasure with Renz and the proposed Amended Covenants. Further, Renz received a legal opinion prior to proceeding with the plan to amend the Covenants and there is no indication that the procedure for amendment stated in the Covenants was not properly followed.\nPlaintiffs are correct in pointing out that Renz had a personal economic interest in the amendments because he was a multiple lot owner; however, if a conflict of interest exists, a transaction is not voidable because of the conflict where \u201c[t]he material facts of the transaction and the director\u2019s interest were disclosed or known to the members entitled to vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction\u201d or the \u201ctransaction was fair to the corporation.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8-31(a).\nHere, there is evidence that those who voted to approve the Amended Covenants were aware that Renz was a multiple lot owner and therefore had an interest in the outcome of the votes. In a letter from plaintiffs to all Village Creek property owners, Renz is referred to as a \u201cmultiple lot owner.\u201d Further, in a letter written by Renz to property owners prior to the vote, he indicated that he was a multiple lot owner.\nKnowing of Renz\u2019s personal interest and other material facts, the property owners still voted to amend the covenants. Further, there is no indication that this vote was not \u201cfair to the corporation,\u201d namely the VCPOA. Based on these facts, Renz\u2019s personal interest in the outcome of the amendment vote does not make this a \u201cvoidable\u201d transaction as described in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8-31(a).\nIn sum, the evidence presented by plaintiffs does not indicate that Renz breached his fiduciary duty and merely shows that he had a differing opinion from plaintiffs on a number of issues regarding the Covenants and Village Creek. As such, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Renz.\nConclusion\nBased on the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the above issues. We affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\nAffirmed.\nJudges GEER and HUNTER, Robert N., Jr. concur.", "author": "HUNTER, Robert C., Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["ARTHUR C.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-164.11 (a), Technocom\u2019s use tax liability should be offset by the erroneously collected sales tax. Therefore, we affirm the ruling of the trial court.\nFacts and Procedural History\nOn 26 September 2008, the North Carolina Department of Revenue (\u201cthe Department\u201d) issued a Notice of Final Determination (\u201cFinal Determination\u201d) to Technocom Business Systems, Incorporated, (\u201cTechnocom\u201d), a corporation in the business of selling and leasing office equipment. The Final Determination was the result of an audit performed on Technocom for the period between 1 June 2002 and 31 August 2005.\nIn the course of its business, Technocom purchases and uses parts, supplies, and materials to fulfill its optional maintenance agreements. It is under these maintenance agreements that Technocom services the equipment that it sells or leases to its customers. Regarding Technocom\u2019s tax liability under these maintenance agreements, the Department made the following conclusion:\nNorth Carolina imposes a State and local use tax on tangible personal property purchased inside or outside the State for storage, use or consumption in this State. . . . Use tax is payable by the person who purchases, leases or rents tangible personal property or who purchases a service.\n[Technocom\u2019s] use of parts, supplies and materials to fulfill its optional maintenance agreements during the audit period constitutes a taxable use of tangible personal property within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-164.3(49) . [Technocom] did not pay sales tax or accrue use tax on these items, and the Department has assessed [Technocom] for the appropriate use tax in its proposed assessment and this final determination.\nBetween 1 June 2002 and 31 August 2005, Technocom collected sales tax on its optional maintenance agreements. The Department held that these agreements were not subject to sales tax because they did not involve services necessary to complete the sale of tangible personal property under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-164.3(37) . Technocom stated to the Department that its sales and use tax liability should be offset by the sales tax it collected on its maintenance agreements. In response, the Department stated that it could not refund or credit Technocom pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-164.11 (a) because there was no proof Technocom had refunded its customers the sales tax it erroneously collected on its optional maintenance agreements.\nOn 18 November 2008, Technocom filed a petition for contested case hearing in the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). Thereafter, on 1 May 2009, Technocom also filed a motion for partial summary judgment and the Department filed a motion for summary judgment. By order entered on 16 November 2009, an administrative law judge granted summary judgment in favor of the Department and sustained the Final Determination. The order concluded that no provision of the Revenue Act allowed Technocom to offset its use tax liability with sales tax it erroneously collected from its customers.\nThe Department, in a final agency decision, upheld the 16 November 2009 decision of the administrative law judge. On 18 March 2010, Technocom filed a petition for judicial review of the final agency decision in Wake County Superior Court.\nFollowing a hearing held 10 December 2010, the superior court reversed the decision of the OAH and the Final Determination of the Department in a 4 January 2011 order. The superior court, in pertinent part, stated:\nTransactions that do not generate a windfall and that do not result in the unfair treatment of customers are not included in the meaning of \u201cexempt or nontaxable sales\u201d in Section 105-164.11(a). Because the transactions at issue here are not \u201cexempt or nontaxable sales,\u201d Section 105-164.11(a) is not applicable. The general provision contained in Section 105-164.41 governs the outcome, and Technocom is entitled to a credit against the sales tax paid to the Department during the audit period.\nThe superior court remanded the case to the OAH with instructions to grant partial summary judgment in favor of Technocom, \u201cleaving open the amount of the tax credit to which [Technocom] is entitled\u201d for the OAH\u2019s determination. Pursuant to the superior court\u2019s order, the administrative law judge entered an order on 3 March 2011 stating the following:\n1. [Technocom] is GRANTED partial summary judgment on the following legal issue:\nWhether the North Carolina Revenue Laws authorize Technocom to offset its use tax liability on the parts and supplies it provided to customers . . . with the sales taxes based on the sales of those same Service Agreements it had previously remitted in error to the Department^]\n2. Petitioner is entitled to a tax credit of $192,457.33 on the parts and supplies [Technocom] previously charged, collected and remitted North Carolina sales tax on when it provided such items to its customers ... if the Order entered in this matter on 4 January 2011 is affirmed on appeal.\n3. No further proceedings at OAH are required in this matter as there is no dispute about the amount of credit [Technocom] would be entitled to if the Order is affirmed on appeal.\nThe Department appeals the superior court\u2019s 4 January 2011 order.\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the North Carolina Revenue Laws authorize Technocom to offset its use tax liability with sales taxes erroneously paid by its customers. The Department argues that no provision in the North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Act (\u201cAct\u201d), N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 105-164.1 et seq., permits Technocom to claim such a credit against its use tax liability.\nAn appellate court reviewing a superior court order regarding an agency decision examines the trial court\u2019s order for error of law. The process has been described as a twofold task: (1) determining whether the trial court exercised the appropriate scope of review and, if appropriate, (2) deciding whether the court did so properly. When, as here, a petitioner contends the [superior court\u2019s] decision was based on an error of law, de novo review is proper.\nHolly Ridge Assocs., LLC v. N.C. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t & Natural Res., 361 N.C. 531, 535, 648 S.E.2d 830, 834 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nBecause this appeal centers on a close reading of the Act, we must seek \u201c[t]he principal goal of statutory construction [which] is to accomplish the legislative intent.\u201d Lenox, Inc. v. Tolson, 353 N.C. 659, 664, 548 S.E.2d 513, 517 (2001) (citation omitted). \u201cIf the language of a statute is clear, the court must implement the statute according to the plain meaning of its terms so long as it is reasonable to do so.\u201d Id.\n[T]he Act, with certain exceptions and in pertinent part, imposes upon persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail in this state a state sales tax at a rate of three percent of the sales price of each item sold. The Act also imposes a complementary state use tax \u201cupon the storage, use or consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased within and without this state for storage, use or consumption within this state\u201d at a rate of three percent of the cost of such property \u201cwhen the same is not sold but used, consumed, distributed or stored for use or consumption in this State. ...\u201d\nIn re Assessment of Additional N. C. & Orange County Use Taxes, etc., 312 N.C. 211, 214, 322 S.E.2d 155, 158 (1984) (citation omitted).\nThe first purpose of the Act is to generate revenue for the state. Id. This is accomplished by a sales tax which is\nimposed upon the retail merchant as a privilege tax for the right to engage in that business. The tax is, however, designed to be passed on to the consumer. The second purpose of the sales and use tax scheme is to equalize the tax burden on all state residents. This is achieved through imposition of the use tax in certain situations where the sales tax is not applicable.\nId. at 214-15, 322 S.E.2d at 158.\n\u201cWhile a sales tax and a use tax in many instances may bring about the same result, they are different in conception.\u201d Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Clayton, 275 N.C. 215, 222, 166 S.E.2d 671, 676 (1969). \u201cA sales tax is assessed on the purchase price of property and is imposed at the time of sale. A use tax is assessed on the storage, use or consumption of property and takes ef[f]ect only after such use begins.\u201d Id. at 223, 166 S.E.2d at 677.\nThe General Assembly has defined a \u201csale\u201d as a \u201ctransfer for consideration of title or possession of tangible personal property ... for consideration of a service.\u201d N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.3(36) (2009). A sale may include such things as a \u201clease or rental\u201d or a \u201ctransaction in which the possession of property is transferred but the seller retains title or security for the payment of the consideration.\u201d Id. The sales tax collected on the \u201csales price\u201d includes the \u201ctotal amount or consideration for which tangible personal property ... or services are sold, leased, or rented.\u201d N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.3(37) (2009). A sales price includes \u201ccharges by the retailer for any services necessary to complete the sale.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). A \u201cuse\u201d, on the other hand, is the \u201cexercise of any right, power, or dominion whatsoever over tangible personal property ... by the purchaser of the property or service.\u201d N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.3(49) (2009).\nIn the instant case, Technocom does not dispute that it improperly collected sales tax on amounts charged under its optional maintenance agreements and that Technocom should have paid a use tax in connection with the parts and supplies it provided under those agreements. However, it does argue that pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-164.41, the Department is required to issue Technocom a credit against \u201cany\u201d tax. Technocom asserts that the Department should credit the sales taxes made in error against the use tax assessment levied by the Department, particularly, whereas here, the Department seeks to treat the transactions at issue as a \u201cuse\u201d for tax purposes but as a \u201csale\u201d for refund purposes.\nN.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.41, titled \u201cExcess payments; refunds[,]\u201d states that \u201c[if] it appears that an amount of tax has been paid in excess of that properly due, then the amount in excess shall be credited against any tax or installment thereof then due from the taxpayer[.]\u201d N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.41 (2009). On the other hand, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-164.11 (2009), titled \u201cExcessive and erroneous collections[,]\u201d provides guidance in situations where excessive and erroneous collections are made and, specifically, prohibits the relief sought by Technocom. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.11 provides the following:\nWhen the tax collected for any period is in excess of the total amount that should have been collected, the total amount collected must be paid over to the Secretary. When tax is collected for any period on exempt or nontaxable sales the tax erroneously collected shall be remitted to the Secretary and no refund shall be made to a taxpayer unless the purchaser has received credit for or has been refunded the amount of tax erroneously charged.\nN.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.11 (2009) (emphasis added).\nThe rules of \u201c[statutory construction requiref] that a more specific statute controls over a statute of general applicability.\u201d Stewart v. Johnston County Bd. Of Educ., 129 N.C. App. 108, 110, 498 S.E.2d 382, 384 (1998). \u201cWhen two statutes apparently overlap, it is well established that the statute special and particular shall control over the statute general in nature, even if the general statute is more recent, unless it clearly appears that the legislature intended the general statute to control.\u201d Trustees of Rowan Technical College v. J. Hyatt Associates, Inc., 313 N.C. 230, 238, 328 S.E.2d 274, 279 (1985) (citation omitted).\nN.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.41 is the more general statute, applying to any situation where the amount of tax has been paid in excess of that properly due. However, although N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.11 is a more specific and particular statute, it does not apply to the instant case, as the Department would have us hold. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.11 only applies to taxes collected on \u201cexempt or nontaxable sales.\u201d As previously stated, a sale is the transfer of tangible personal property for a consideration to be paid. In its February 2010 Final Agency Decision, the Department concluded that the optional maintenance agreements at issue constituted a taxable use of tangible personal property within the meaning of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.3(49) and not a sale. Accordingly, the Department held that the agreements were subject to use taxes and not sales taxes. Therefore, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.11 does not apply. We hold that the general provision in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 105-164.41 governs the outcome, entitling Technocom to a credit against the sales tax paid to the Department during the audit period. Based on the foregoing, the order of the trial court is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nJudges ELMORE and STEPHENS concur.\n.

Factual and Procedural Background\nThis case arises out of a delinquency petition filed against P.K.M., age twelve. The petition alleged that P.K.M. and several other juveniles broke into and vandalized a vacant building. The investigating detective received information indicating that P.K.M. was involved in the break-in. P.K.M. was called to the principal\u2019s office and then escorted to the school resource officer\u2019s office, where he met with the resource officer and the investigating detective. P.K.M. made incriminating statements during this meeting.\nP.K.M. filed a motion to suppress the statements made to the resource officer and detective. The trial court granted P.KM.\u2019s motion to suppress based upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 131 S. Ct. 2394, 180 L. Ed. 2d. 310 (2011). The State appealed and certified \u201cpursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-979(c) .. . that the appeal [was] not taken for the purpose of delay and that the evidence suppressed [was] essential to the prosecution of the case.\u201d\nII. The State\u2019s Right to Appeal\nP.K.M. contends the State\u2019s appeal must be dismissed because the State lacks a statutory basis for appeal. We agree.\nA. Standard of Review\nWhether the State has a statutory right of appeal to this Court is a question of law that we review de novo. See State v. Lay, 56 N.C. App. 796, 798, 290 S.E.2d 405, 406 (1982) (reviewing this question as one of law and according no deference to the trial court proceedings).\nB. Analysis\nA \u201cproper party\u201d may appeal any \u201cfinal order\u201d made by the trial court under the North Carolina Juvenile Code. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-2602 (2011). The State is a proper party. Id. \u00a7 7B-2604(a). However, the State is limited to appealing two types of orders in delinquency proceedings. Id. \u00a7 7B-2604(b). It may appeal orders ruling that a state statute is unconstitutional. Id. \u00a7 7B-2604(b)(l). It may also appeal \u201c[a]ny order which terminates the prosecution of a petition by upholding the defense of double jeopardy, by holding that a cause of action is not stated under a statute, or by granting a motion to suppress.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7B-2604(b)(2). Thus, the State may only appeal the order granting P.KM.\u2019s motion to suppress if that order terminated the prosecution.\nAlthough the State does not explicitly concede the issue, the State does not argue in its brief that the trial court\u2019s order terminated the prosecution. The trial court\u2019s order granting the motion to suppress did not state that the prosecution was terminated. The court did not dismiss the case. The State did not dismiss the case or inform the trial court that it could not proceed with the case for lack of evidence.\nGranting a motion to suppress does not, standing alone, dispose of a juvenile delinquency case. Cf. In re K.D.L., _ N.C. App. _, _, 700 S.E.2d 766, 773 (2010) (reversing the denial of a motion to suppress and remanding for further proceedings because of the possibility that the State could have elected to proceed without the confession). Assuming arguendo that dismissal of the case for insufficient evidence is not required in order to satisfy the \u201cterminates the prosecution\u201d standard created by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-2604(b)(2), our review of the record suggests the State could present alternate evidence of P.K.M.\u2019s alleged involvement in the break-in. A teacher at P.KM.\u2019s school overheard several students discussing the break-in. This information led the police to develop P.K.M. as a suspect. The State does not argue on appeal that it could not have proceeded without P.K.M.\u2019s statements, and we decline to make this assumption.\nThe State\u2019s certification referencing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-979(c) has no bearing on this appeal. That statute governs the State\u2019s appeal of a motion to suppress in a criminal case. It does not apply to cases under the Juvenile Code.\n\u201cIn North Carolina, there is no inherent right to appeal. Rather, avenues of appeal are created by statute.\u201d Northfield Dev. Co. v. City of Burlington, 165 N.C. App. 885, 887, 599 S.E.2d 921, 924 (2004) (citing Cox v. Kinston, 217 N.C. 391, 396, 8 S.E.2d 252, 257 (1940)). The State has no statutory right of appeal in this case, and it has not petitioned for certiorari review. Therefore, the State\u2019s appeal is\nDISMISSED.\nJudges ELMORE and STROUD concur.", "author": "STEELMAN, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["In the Matter of P.K.M."]}}}

For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nI. Background\nOn 8 December 2010, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant alleging \u201c[t]hat the Defendant has failed, refused, and neglected to pay the amount due on\u201d a promissory note (\u201cNote\u201d) of which \u201cPlaintiff is the owner and holder[.]\u201d Plaintiff specifically noted that it \u201chas elected to bring suit on the Note without waiving its right to proceed later, if applicable, to foreclosure the Deed of Trust[.]\u201d Plaintiff requested $204,333.91, the amount owed on the Note, plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees. On 2 March 2011, defendant answered the complaint and denied that plaintiff is the owner and holder of the Note. On 24 June 2011, plaintiff moved for summary judgment. On 25 July 2011, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. Defendant appeals.\nII. Summary Judgment\nThe Note in our record is between defendant as borrower and Carolina First Bank as lender. The Note provides that \u201c \u2018You\u2019 and \u2018Your\u2019 refer to the Lender.\u201d The Note further provides that the borrower \u201cpromise[s] to pay you or your order, at your address, or at such other location as you may designate, the principal sum of $224,910.00 (Principal) plus interest from February 23, 2008 on the unpaid Principal balance until this Note matures or this obligation is accelerated.\u201d Thus, defendant promised to pay Carolina First Bank or Carolina First Bank\u2019s order.\nDefendant contends that \u201cthe trial court erred in allowing plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment[,]\u201d (original in all caps), because \u201cTD Bank failed to show that it was the owner and holder of the promissory note upon which it has sued.\u201d\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. A trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment receives de novo review on appeal, and evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\nMitchell, Brewer, Richardson v. Brewer, _ N.C. App. _, _, 705 S.E.2d 757, 764-65 (citations and quotation marks omitted), disc. review denied, 365 N.C. 188, 707 S.E.2d 243 (2011).\nIn Liles v. Myers, \u201c[t]he plaintiff brought [an] action seeking to recover $3,200 which she alleged was owed her by the defendant on a promissory note.\u201d 38 N.C. App. 525, 525, 248 S.E.2d 385, 386 (1978). Thereafter, \u201c[t]he plaintiff moved for summary judgment.\u201d Id. at 526, 248 S.E.2d at 386. \u201cThe trial court. . . granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed.\u201d Id. at 526, 248 S.E.2d at 387. This Court stated,\nPrior to being entitled to a judgment against the defendant, the plaintiff was required to establish that she was holder of the note at the time of this suit. This element might have been established by a showing that the plaintiff was in possession of the instrument and that it was issued or endorsed to her, to her order, to bearer or in blank. It is essential that this element be established in order to protect the maker from any possibility of multiple judgments against him on the same note through no fault of his own. . . .\nAs evidence that a plaintiff is holder of a note is an essential element of a cause of action upon such note, the defendant was entitled to demand strict proof of this element. By his answer denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendant demanded such strict proof. The incorporation by reference into the complaint of a copy of the note was not in itself sufficient evidence to establish for purposes of summary judgment that the plaintiff was the holder of the note. As the record on appeal fails to reveal that the note itself or any other competent evidence was introduced to show that the plaintiff was the holder of the note, she has failed to prove each essential element of her claim sufficiently to establish her entitlement to summary judgment.\nId. at 526-28, 248 S.E.2d at 387-88 (citations omitted); see Hotel Corp. v. Taylor, 301 N.C. 200, 203, 271 S.E.2d 54, 57 (1980) (\u201cG.S. 25-3-301 provides that the holder of a negotiable instrument may enforce payment in his own name. To bring suit on the instrument in his own name, the plaintiff must first establish that he is in fact a holder. The holder of an instrument is defined in G.S. 25-1-201(20) to be one who is in possession of an instrument drawn, issued, or indorsed to him or to his order or to bearer or in blank. Where, as in this case, a negotiable instrument is made payable to order, one becomes a holder of the instrument when it is properly indorsed and delivered to him.. Mere possession of a note payable to order does not suffice to prove ownership or holder status.\u201d (citations and quotation marks omitted)).\nPlaintiff argues that it now stands in the place of Carolina First Bank on the Note due to a merger between it and Carolina First Bank. However, neither the complaint nor any other documents in the record which were presented to the trial court reveal any evidence of a merger or explain why plaintiff is TD Bank instead of Carolina First Bank. In Hotel Corp., our Supreme Court stated,\nPlaintiff in this case alleged in its complaint that it became the owner and holder of the note sued upon by merger with indorsee Econo-Travel Corporation. G.S. 55-110(b) provides that in the event of a merger between corporations, the surviving corporation succeeds by operation of law to all of the rights, privileges, immunities, franchises and other property of the constituent corporations, without the necessity of a deed, bill of sale, or other form of assignment. Therefore, if the alleged merger had occurred, then plaintiff, as the surviving corporation, would have succeeded by operation of law to Econo-Travel Corporation\u2019s status as owner and holder of the promissory note, and would have had standing to enforce the note in its own name.\nHowever, plaintiff introduced no evidence to support its allegation of the existence of a merger, choosing instead to rest on its pleadings, which merely contended that a merger had taken place. Since defendant-appellants had met their burden under Rule 56 as movants for summary judgment, it was incumbent upon plaintiff to come forth with evidence to controvert defendant\u2019s case, or otherwise suffer entry of summary judgment against it. It would have been a simple matter for plaintiff to present evidence of a merger in a form permitted under Rule 56(c), if a merger had in fact occurred. By resting on its pleadings, plaintiff failed to establish a genuine issue as to whether it was the owner and holder of the note, therefore defendant-appellants were entitled to entry of summary judgment in their favor as a matter of law, and the trial court was correct in so ordering.\n301 N.C. at 204-05, 271 S.E.2d at 58.\nPlaintiff contends that this \u201cCourt can and should take judicial notice of the merger in this appeal, regardless of the record below\u201d and directs this Court\u2019s attention to various documents regarding the alleged merger, including documents which appear to have been filed with the Secretary of State of South Carolina. These documents were only provided in the appendix of plaintiffs brief. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 201 provides:\n(a) Scope of rule.\u2014This rule governs only judicial notice of adjudicative facts.\n(b) Kinds of facts.\u2014A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\n(c) When discretionary.\u2014A court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not.\n(d) When mandatory.\u2014A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information.\n(e) Opportunity to be heard.\u2014In a trial court, a party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, the request may be made after judicial notice has been taken.\n(f) Time of taking notice.\u2014Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 201 (2007).\nPlaintiff argues that this Court should take judicial notice of the merger under either the first or second prong of subsection (b). Plaintiff first contends that the merger is \u201cgenerally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court[.]\u201d Id. We first note that judicial notice of facts \u201cgenerally known within the territorial jurisdiction\u201d of the court are normally \u201csubjects and facts of common and general knowledge.\u201d Dowdy v. R. R. and Burns, 237 N.C. 519, 526, 75 S.E.2d 639, 644 (1953). Some examples of the sorts of facts which have been judicially noticed in North Carolina are that \u201c[i]t is common knowledge that light bulbs bum out unexpectedly and frequently[,]\u201d Reese v. Piedmont, Inc., 240 N.C. 391, 397, 82 S.E.2d 365, 369 (1954) and that \u201cgasoline either alone or mixed with kerosene constitutes a flammable commodity and a highly explosive agent.\u201d Stegall v. Oil Co., 260 N.C. 459, 462, 133 S.E.2d 138, 141 (1963). Although we recognize that it may be appropriate for an appellate court to take judicial notice of a bank merger in some situations, we do not believe that the alleged merger of TD Bank and First Carolina Bank falls within the realm of \u201ccommon and general knowledge.\u201d Dowdy, 237 N.C. at 526, 75 S.E.2d at 644. Although plaintiffs brief compares the notoriety of its merger to that of Wachovia and Wells Fargo, which at least one federal court has judicially noticed, it appears that these banks are not quite so well-known as Wells Fargo and Wachovia as this panel has never heard of TD Bank or First Carolina Bank, much less of their merger, and thus we cannot say that this purported South Carolina merger is \u201cgenerally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 201.\nPlaintiff next contends that the merger should be judicially noticed because it is a fact \u201ccapable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Id. Although in certain situations copies of documents certified by the Secretary of State, even a state other than North Carolina, may be \u201csources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned[,]\u201d we do not deem plaintiff\u2019s merger documents to be so here. Id. Due to the manner in which plaintiff presented us with its merger documents, we conclude that defendant has reasonably questioned these documents in its reply brief. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 201. Defendant argues,\n[W]e have a claim of an out of state merger of financial institutions, the type of transaction that can be so complex and filled with regulatory and legal compliance directives from the FDIC, state banking authorities, and private arrangements involving transfers of title, exceptions to what is transferred, recourse between parties to the merger, and other qualifications, both in public documents and in confidential business documents, as to strain the lawyerly imagination. While plaintiffs brief on appeal has attached a photocopy of merger documents allegedly filed with the South Carolina Secretary of State, a photocopy of an Agreement and Plan of Merger and a photocopy of a Conditional Approval from the Comptroller of Currency, none of these photocopies, which were not produced to the trial court, are certified or authenticated per North Carolina law. Nor does plaintiff make the Court aware of whatever other documents might exist, which might not be part of a public record but which may nonetheless cast light on whether plaintiff is the owner and holder of the note that is a subject of this case, or of any other assets of Carolina First Bank.\nAs such, we conclude there is a reasonable question as to whether plaintiff did merge with Carolina First Bank.\nPlaintiff also argues that judicial notice is mandatory, as it has been \u201crequested by a party[,]\u201d and plaintiff has \u201csupplied . . . the necessary information.\u201d We do not consider plaintiff\u2019s provision of the alleged merger documents as an appendix to its brief as supplying the necessary information under Rule 201. See id. Plaintiff had many options for properly filing its merger documents and yet failed to do so. Plaintiff could have filed an affidavit regarding the alleged merger with the trial court, presented the merger documents as exhibits before the trial court or included the documents in the record on appeal, as a supplement to the record or through a separate motion. Instead, plaintiff provided its only evidence of its alleged merger with First Carolina Bank, a merger which is not even mentioned in the complaint, through the appendix of its brief. Rule 9 of our Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that \u201c[i]n appeals from the trial division of the General Court of Justice, review is solely upon the record on appeal, the verbatim transcript of proceedings, if one is designated, and any other items filed pursuant to this Rule 9.\u201d N.C.R. App. P. 9. In addition, because plaintiff failed to present the merger documents before the trial court, defendant has not had the opportunity to respond fully to the documents included in the appendix to plaintiffs brief and to the extent defendant has responded it has questioned the authenticity of plaintiffs documents. We will therefore not take judicial notice of the alleged merger or its effect upon the transaction in this case.\nWhile in certain situations, taking judicial notice of a bank merger may be appropriate, we do not deem it so in this case, where at the summary judgment stage no evidence of the merger was forecast before the trial court, plaintiff failed to properly present evi dence of a merger with this Court, and defendant has specifically contested the authenticity of the merger documents provided in the appendix to plaintiffs brief. However, we do believe that the information presented by plaintiff raises a genuine issue of material fact. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and remand for further proceedings. See Mitchell at _, 705 S.E.2d at 764.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. As we are reversing and remanding this case, we need not address defendant\u2019s other arguments on appeal.\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\nJudge STEPHENS concurs.\nJudge BEASLEY concurs in the result only.\n. We do not have a transcript, and thus we do not know what plaintiff argued before the trial court. However, we must rely upon the record before us, which indicates that no evidence of the merger was presented before the trial court. See N.C.R.

Chut for defendant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "ELMORE, Judge.\nAaron Pittman (defendant) appeals from judgments entered upon jury convictions for 1) insurance fraud, 2) obtaining property by false pretenses, and 3) exploitation of an elder adult. After careful consideration, we find no error.\nIn late 2003 defendant was employed as an insurance salesman. Around this time, he went to the home of Effie Satterwhite, a woman in her eighties who was limited in her abilities to read and write. Defendant spoke to Satterwhite about purchasing insurance, and Satterwhite decided to buy a $10,000.00 burial insurance policy from defendant. Defendant helped Satterwhite complete the forms. The policy listed Satterwhite\u2019s half-sister, Sally, as the beneficiary.\nDefendant continued to have a relationship with Satterwhite after he sold the policy to her. After some time, defendant introduced Satterwhite to his wife, Mildred Dew. Satterwhite then developed a relationship with defendant and Dew, and the couple occasionally cleaned Satterwhite\u2019s house. During one of his visits, defendant took copies of Satterwhite\u2019s driver\u2019s license and some of her financial records.\nIn October 2004, defendant sold Satterwhite two additional insurance policies, 1) another $10,000.00 life insurance policy and 2) a $50,000.00 annuity. Again, defendant helped Satterwhite complete the necessary paperwork. These policies also listed Sally as the beneficiary. However, sometime later Dew was made the beneficiary on all three of Satterwhite\u2019s policies. Both Satterwhite\u2019s and Dew\u2019s signatures appeared on the change forms, and Dew was listed as Satterwhite\u2019s niece. After that, Dew began taking money out of the cash values of the life insurance policies and withdrawing money from the annuity. By March 2008, the annuity was \u201ctotally cashed out\u201d and had \u201cno value\u201d remaining.\nOn 5 January 2010, Satterwhite went to her local bank to withdraw money. She was informed by the teller that she did not have enough money in her account to complete her withdrawal. Satterwhite was alarmed by this discovery, and she then spoke with the teller manager. The manager informed Satterwhite that defendant was a joint owner on her account, and that defendant had opened a checking account and linked it to her account. At that time, the local police department was contacted, and Detective Ricky Cates was assigned to the case.\nDetective Cates discovered that defendant had changed the address listed on Satterwhite\u2019s account so that the monthly statements were being sent directly to him. Detective Cates also discovered that defendant had linked his account to Satterwhite\u2019s under the guise that he was her son. A review of Satterwhite\u2019s bank records also revealed that defendant had made a series of large cash withdrawals from her account.\nDefendant and Dew were then arrested on 21 January 2010. At the time of his arrest, defendant was in possession of Satterwhite\u2019s driver\u2019s license and the title to her car. Defendant and Dew were each charged with 1) two counts of insurance fraud, 2) one count of obtaining property by false pretenses, and 3) one count of exploitation of an elder adult. Prior to trial, the State filed a motion to allow for joinder of defendant and Dew for trial. On 21 February 2010, defendant filed an objection to the State\u2019s motion for joinder, but the trial court granted the motion nonetheless.\nOn 28 February 2011 the case came on for trial by jury. At trial, the State offered into evidence prior statements made by Dew. These statements, in sum, established 1) that \u201cher husband, Aaron Pittman told her to sign the form[s],\u201d and 2) that \u201cshe thought it was wrong, but she trusted her husband.\u201d Defendant testified at trial in his own defense. On 3 March 2011, the jury found defendant guilty of 1) insurance fraud, 2) obtaining property by false pretenses, and 3) exploitation of an elder adult. The trial court then sentenced defendant to 1) 96 to 125 months imprisonment for insurance fraud and obtaining property by false pretenses and to 2) 21 to 26 months imprisonment for exploitation of an elder adult. These sentences were ordered to be served consecutively. Defendant now appeals.\nDefendant first argues that the trial court violated North Carolina law by granting the State\u2019s motion for joinder. Defendant further argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the motion for joinder deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree.\n\u201cJoinder decisions are in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d State v. Fultz, 92 N.C. App. 80, 82, 373 S.E.2d 445, 447 (1988). According to our General Statutes, charges against two or more defendants may be joined for trial if the charges 1) are part of a common scheme or plan, 2) are part of the same act or transaction, or 3) are closely connected in time, place, and occasion. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-926(b)(2) (2011). In fact, \u201cpublic policy strongly compels consolidation as the rule rather than the exception when each defendant is sought to be held accountable for the same crime or crimes.\u201d State v. Paige, 316 N.C. 630, 643, 343 S.E.2d 848, 857 (1986) (citation and quotations omitted). Thus, \u201cthe test we apply on review is whether the offenses are so separate in time and place and so distinct in circumstances as to render consolidation unjust and prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d Fultz, 92 N.C. App. at 83, 373 S.E.2d at 447 (quotations and citations omitted).\nHere, defendant and Dew were charged with the same crimes, and these crimes arose out of the same common scheme. Defendant sold the policies to Satterwhite, and Dew signed the paperwork necessary to add herself as the beneficiary on the policies. Thus, the offenses committed by defendant and Dew were closely related and connected. As such, the decision of the trial court to join defendant and Dew for trial did not violate state law.\nDefendant also argues that the decision of the trial court deprived him of a fair trial, because the State was permitted to offer statements of Dew that placed all of the blame for her charges on defendant. We disagree.\nOur Supreme Court has held that\n[e]ven though the defendants in a joint trial may offer antagonistic or conflicting defenses, that fact alone does not necessarily warrant severance. The test is whether the conflict in defendants respective positions at trial is of such a nature that, considering all of the other evidence in the case, defendants were denied a fair trial.\nState v. Lowery, 318 N.C. 54, 59, 347 S.E.2d 729, 734 (1986) (quotations and citations omitted).\nHere, the record clearly establishes that defendant did not dispute the fundamental accuracy of the State\u2019s showing that: 1) he sold Satterwhite multiple insurance policies and an annuity; 2) he later changed the beneficiaries associated with those policies to Dew and converted Satterwhite\u2019s bank accounts from individual accounts solely owned by Satterwhite to joint accounts owned by both defendant and Satterwhite; and 3) he obtained money from the insurance policies, the annuities, and the joint accounts and used that money for personal purposes. Thus, the essential difference between the evidence presented by the State and the evidence presented on behalf of defendant was that the State\u2019s evidence tended to show that Satterwhite never authorized or approved of defendant\u2019s actions while the evidence presented on defendant\u2019s behalf tended to show that he had been acting on Satterwhite\u2019s behalf, in Satterwhite\u2019s best interests, or with Satterwhite\u2019s consent. Therefore, the central issue that the jury was required to resolve was not whether the relevant financial transactions occurred but whether Satterwhite had authorized or approved of those transactions.\nWhen viewed in this context, Dew\u2019s statements likely had little bearing on the jury\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of defendant\u2019s claim to have acted in Satterwhite\u2019s best interests or with her consent. Thus, we are not persuaded that Dew\u2019s statements played a significant role in the jury\u2019s determination of the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt given that Dew\u2019s statements shed little or no light on the intent with which defendant acted. As a result, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s joinder decision did not impermissibly prejudice defendant, because 1) the State offered extensive evidentiary support for the jury\u2019s finding of guilt and 2) Dew\u2019s statements bore limited relevance to the principal issue before the jury. Thus, we are unable to agree that Dew\u2019s statements denied him of a fair trial.\nDefendant next argues that evidence of the statements made by Dew to investigating officers should have been deemed inadmissible at their joint trial. We decline to reach this issue on the grounds that defendant did not properly preserve this issue for appellate review given his failure to object to the introduction of the challenged statements, to seek redaction of the statements, or to argue that the admission of the challenged evidence constituted plain error.\n\u201cIn order to preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection, or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context. It is also necessary for the complaining party to obtain a ruling upon the party\u2019s request, objection, or motion.\u201d N.C.R. App. P. 10(a)(1). As a result, where defendant \u201ceither did not object to admission of the evidence, or failed to state any grounds for his objection [, he] ... failed to preserve these [issues] ... for review other than for plain error.\u201d State v. Locklear, 363 N.C. 438, 451, 681 S.E.2d 293, 304 (2009) (citing State v. Garcell, 363 N.C. 10, 35, 678 S.E.2d 618, 634, cert. denied, _ U.S. _, 130 S. Ct. 510, 175 L. Ed. 2d 362 (2009)).\nHere, the challenged statements were admitted into evidence during the testimony of Mr. Tesh, who interviewed Dew during the course of his investigation. Near the beginning of his testimony, Mr. Tesh asked to read aloud from a statement he had taken from Dew. At that point, defendant\u2019s trial counsel interposed a general objection, which the trial court overruled. Subsequently, Mr. Tesh testified in considerable detail about a series of documents that he had shown to Dew and the comments that Dew made during the course of their discussion. Among other things, Mr. Tesh told the jury that Dew had denied any knowledge of at least seven of these documents, that she denied having signed several documents that bore her name, that she signed other documents in compliance with instructions that she had received from Defendant, and that, while she thought that signing an authorization allowing the withdrawal of money from a particular account was wrong, she signed the relevant document anyway because she trusted her husband. Defendant never objected to any portion of the challenged testimony or asked to have any of the statements upon which his argument is predicated redacted during Mr. Tesh\u2019s trial testimony. Moreover, defendant did not object when Dew\u2019s trial counsel elicited testimony from Mr. Tesh to the same effect as the testimony that had been elicited from Dew on direct examination or when Mr. Tesh testified that he believed Dew was being truthful with him. As a result, given the absence of any contemporaneous objection to the admission of the challenged testimony, defendant has failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. Moreover, \u201csince defendant does not argue plain error on appeal, defendant has not preserved for appellate review any issue as to the admission of [Dew\u2019s] statement[s].\u201d State v. Ross, _ N.C. App. _, _ S.E.2d _, _ (2011). As a result, we conclude that defendant did not properly preserve his challenge to the admission of Dew\u2019s testimony, and we decline to reach the merits of this issue.\nNo Error.\nJudges BRYANT and ERVIN concur.", "author": "ELMORE, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

For the following reasons, we reverse both orders and remand this case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nOn or about 14 September 2006, the parties entered into a contract for services, delivery, and setup of fifty engines for use in custom motorcycles. Defendant paid Plaintiff $87,914 at the time the engines were ordered and another $87,914 when the engines were delivered to Plaintiffs facility. Defendant also paid an additional $55,800.50 for parts upon delivery of the engines. In total, Defendant has paid Plaintiff $231,658.50. However, Defendant still owes Plaintiff a sum of $38,000. Defendant received 15 engines that Plaintiff completed work on, but the rest of the engines remained in Plaintiffs possession.\nPlaintiff asserted a possessory lien on the remaining property by service of notice to Defendant under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-1. Defendant responded, and requested a judicial hearing. In spite of this request, Plaintiff sold three of the engines at auction. On 13 January 2010, Plaintiff filed a complaint asserting Defendant was liable for breach of contract and unfair and deceptive trade practices, and claiming that it had the right to retain possession of the remaining 35 engines and other property under a valid claim of lien. On 23 April 2010, Defendant filed an answer and counterclaim asserting breach of contract, violation of lien statute N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-4, claim and delivery, conversion/trespass to chattels, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. Defendants also included an allegation of the personal liability of David Vaseleniuck for violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-30 and an assertion of the right to attorney fees pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-16.1. On 23 August 2010, Defendant filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to its claim against Plaintiff for violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-4 et seq. This motion was granted by order filed 8 November 2010 (2010 order).\nOn 23 February 2011, Defendant filed another motion for partial summary judgment, this time as to the claims of (i) conversion/trespass to chattels, (ii) claim and delivery, (iii) unfair and deceptive trade practice, and (iv) violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-30. This motion was granted with regard to the conversion/trespass to chattels claim and denied for all other claims by order dated 4 April 2011 (2011 order). From these orders, Plaintiff now appeals.\nI.\nFirst, we note that Plaintiff\u2019s brief raises several issues regarding its compliance with our rules of appellate procedure and the interlocutory nature of the 8 November 2010 and 4 April 2011 orders. These issues were resolved in this Court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. As this Court has held that Plaintiff\u2019s appeal from these two orders is properly before us, we turn to address Plaintiff\u2019s substantive arguments.\nII.\nPlaintiff contends that the trial court improperly entered the 2010 order granting summary judgment on Defendant\u2019s claim that Plaintiff violated N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-4. Specifically, the 2010 order adjudged Plaintiff liable under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-4(g) (2011) which provides that if a lienor \u201cfails to comply substantially with any of the provisions of this section, the lienor shall be liable to the person having legal title to the property[.]\u201d Although the evidence before the trial court was sufficient to raise an inference that Plaintiff failed to substantially comply with N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-4 (2011), \u201c[t]his is a factual issue which can be determined only by the jury\u201d and thus \u201cthe court erred in failing to submit this issue to the jury.\u201d Drummond v. Cordell, 73 N.C. App. 438, 441, 326 S.E.2d 292, 293 (1985). Accordingly, we reverse the 2010 order.\nIII.\nPlaintiff next contends that the trial court erred in entering the 2011 order granting Defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the claims of conversion and trespass to chattels. We agree.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-2(a) (2011) mandates that \u201c[a]ny person who . . . alters, repairs, stores, services, treats, or improves personal property other than a motor vehicle or an aircraft in the ordinary course of his business pursuant to a[] . . . contract with an owner or legal possessor of the personal property has a lien upon the property.\u201d Because it is uncontroverted that Plaintiff has altered the condition of all the engines in its possession, and has not been paid in full for this work, Plaintiff is entitled to a possessory lien on each engine.\n\u201cA successful action for trespass to chattel requires the party bringing the action to demonstrate . . . that there was an unauthorized, unlawful interference or dispossession of the property[.]\u201d Fordham v. Eason, 351 N.C. 151, 155, 521 S.E.2d 701, 704 (1999) (citations omitted and emphasis added). \u201cThe tort of conversion is well defined as an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the . . . exclusion of an owner\u2019s rights.\u201d Peed v. Burleson\u2019s, Inc., 244 N.C. 437, 439, 94 S.E.2d 351, 353 (1956) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). To grant Defendant summary judgment on the claims of trespass to chattels or conversion, the trial court had to have found that Plaintiffs possession of the engines was unauthorized. Because we hold that Plaintiff has shown a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether it has a valid possessory lien over the all the engines in its possession, the trial court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment to Defendant must be reversed.\nReversed and Remanded.\nJudges STEPHENS and STROUD concur.\n.

Confessions and Incriminating Statements\u2014defendant\u2019s statement\u2014not coerced\nDefendant\u2019s confession to five murders was not coerced where he contended that police threatened to imprison his father unless he confessed, but the trial court\u2019s findings sufficiently supported the conclusion that defendant\u2019s confession was not coerced.

Arbogast, for the State.\nMark Montgomery for Defendant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "BEASLEY, Judge.\nSamuel James Cooper (Defendant) appeals from judgments based on his convictions for robbery with a dangerous weapon and five counts of first degree murder. For the following reasons, we find no error.\nOn 21 November 2007, Defendant robbed the Garner Plaza branch of Bank of America while possessing and threatening the use of a firearm. After Defendant was apprehended, his weapon was seized; the State Bureau of Investigation later linked that weapon to five unsolved murders. Defendant initially denied involvement in the murders, but eventually confessed that he had committed all five. Between 10 December and 11 December 2007, Defendant was indicted for robbery with a dangerous weapon and five counts of first degree murder.\nBy motion dated 22 October 2009, Defendant moved to suppress \u201call statements made by the defendant which were obtained by the police in violation of defendant\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights.\u201d This motion was denied on 17 December 2009 by the Honorable Henry W. Hight, Jr. Defendant was found guilty of all charges by a Wake County jury on 6 April 2010. By judgments dated 16 April and 20 April 2010, Defendant was sentenced to 117 to 150 months imprisonment for the charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon and to life imprisonment without parole for all five counts of first degree murder. Defendant gave notice of appeal in open court.\nI.\nDefendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements confessing to the murders because they were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights, and were the result of threats by the police. We disagree.\nFirst, we address Defendant\u2019s argument that his confession was not voluntary because it was obtained through threats by police. It is well-established that \u201cfindings of fact made by a trial judge following a voir dire on the voluntariness of a confession are conclusive ... if they are supported by competent evidence. Conclusions of law that are correct in light of the findings of fact are also binding on appeal.\u201d State v. Gainey, 355 N.C. 73, 84, 558 S.E.2d 463, 471 (2002) (citations omitted). When determining whether a confession is voluntary, we look at the totality of the circumstances. State v. Corley, 310 N.C. 40, 47, 311 S.E.2d 540, 545 (1984). \u201cThe proper determination is whether the confession at issue was the product of improperly induced hope or fear. [Our Supreme] Court has held that an improper inducement must promise relief from the criminal charge to which the confession relates, and not merely provide the defendant with a collateral advantage.\u201d Gainey, 355 N.C. at 84, 558 S.E.2d at 471 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nDefendant argues that his statements were coerced, because police threatened to imprison his father unless he confessed. The trial court concluded that \u201c[n]o promises, offers of reward, or inducements for Defendant to make a statement were made.\u201d The trial court further stated that \u201c[n]o threat or suggested violence or show of violence to persuade defendant to make a statement were made. The arrest of the Defendant\u2019s father was not wrongful pressure applied by law enforcement.\u201d\nIn support of these conclusions, the trial court found that \u201cat no point was the Defendant ever promised or told that his father would benefit by any statement from the Defendant.\u201d The testimony of Detective Passley that he never told Defendant\u2019s mother that if Defendant confessed, his father would be released supports this finding, as does the testimony of Defendant\u2019s sister that nobody told her that if Defendant confessed, her father would be released. Additionally, the trial court found that \u201cDefendant specifically acknowledged that T understand and know what I am doing. No promises or threats have been made and no pressure or coercion of any kind has been used against me by any officer.\u2019 \u201d These findings of fact are more than sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Defendant\u2019s confession was not coerced. Accordingly, this argument is overruled.\nWe next address Defendant\u2019s contention that his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was violated. The law is clear that \u201c[although custodial interrogation must cease when a suspect unequivocally invokes his right to silence, an ambiguous invocation does not require police to cease interrogation immediately.\u201d State v. Forte, 360 N.C. 427, 438, 629 S.E.2d 137, 145 (2006) (citation omitted).\nThe trial court found that \u201cDefendant did not invoke his right to counsel or his right to remain silent.\u201d Defendant argues that he refused to talk to police about the murders, other than to deny his involvement; thus he invoked his right to remain silent. Defendant\u2019s continued assertions of his innocence cannot be considered unambiguous invocations of his right to remain silent. See Berghuis v. Thompkins, _ U.S. _, _, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1078, 1110-11 (2010) (extending the rule that a suspect invoking the right to counsel must do so \u201cunambiguously\u201d to invocation of the right to remain silent). We find ample evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent.\nFinally, we consider whether Defendant\u2019s confession was improperly obtained after he invoked his right to counsel. Much like the right to remain silent, the invocation of the right to counsel must be unambiguous. State v. Hyatt, 355 N.C. 642, 655, 566 S.E.2d 61, 70 (2002). The trial court concluded that \u201cdefendant fully understood ... his constitutional right to counsel[,]\u201d and that he \u201cfreely, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived each of those rights and thereupon made the statement. ...\u201d\nIt is uncontroverted that after the arrest of his father, Defendant reached out to police for the purpose of resuming interrogation. However, Defendant contends that by arresting his father and \u201cparading\u201d him in front of Defendant, the police first engaged in conduct that was the functional equivalent of re-initiating interrogation after Defendant invoked his right to counsel. Although it appears that Defendant did invoke his right to counsel prior to making the statements at issue, because Defendant was the one who re-initiated the conversation with police, his right to counsel was not violated when detectives took his later statements. See State v. Golphin, 352 N.C. 364, 406, 533 S.E.2d 168, 199 (2000).\nThe trial court found that Defendant was never promised that his father would benefit from any statement he made. This finding has adequate record support. Consequently, we decline to hold that the lawful arrest of Defendant\u2019s father constituted the re-initiation of the interrogation of Defendant. Defendant initiated further conversation with police after invoking his right to counsel, and then waived his rights and confessed to the five murders. This statement was given willingly and knowingly, and as such Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.\nII.\nDefendant also argues that the trial court erred in its instruction of the jury as to the meaning of \u201cdeliberation.\u201d Defendant asked for a special instruction on the meaning of \u201cdeliberation\u201d at trial, requesting to have the jury instructed that deliberation means not only that Defendant acted \u201cin a cool state of mind,\u201d as the pattern jury instruction states, but also that Defendant \u201cweighed the consequences of his actions.\u201d The trial court declined to modify the pattern jury instruction. Our Supreme Court has instructed that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s omission of elements of a crime in its recitation of jury instructions is reviewed under the harmless error test.\u201d State v. Bunch, 363 N.C. 841, 845, 689 S.E.2d 866, 869 (2010). Even assuming, arguendo, that Defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s refusal to alter the jury instruction on deliberation amounted to an omission of an element of the charged crimes, we find that the error was harmless.\nA trial court\u2019s error \u201c \u2018is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if it did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting State v. Nelson, 341 N.C. 695, 701, 462 S.E.2d 225, 228 (1995)). For each count of first degree murder Defendant was found guilty on the basis of malice, premeditation and deliberation and on the basis of the first degree felony murder rule. Thus, even if the trial court\u2019s jury instruction was in error and that error did change the jury\u2019s verdict as to the finding of deliberation, the error would still be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the jury\u2019s verdict was based on two separate, independent grounds.\nNo Error.\nJudges ERVIN and THIGPEN, JR. concur.", "author": "BEASLEY, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

(Hunter). Plaintiffs added an additional Defendant, Urban Design Partners (Urban Design), on 7 April 2009. Hunter and Village subsequently moved for partial summary judgment and New South moved for summary judgment. On 16 April 2010, the trial court granted the motions for summary judgment as to the SPCA claims, and denied the motions with respect to all other claims. The trial court filed the order on 19 April 2010 and Hunter\u2019s counsel served the order upon the other parties on the same date. The trial court tried all of the remaining claims beginning on 19 April 2010. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiffs, finding Plaintiffs were damaged by the negligence of New South/Apple Creek, Hunter, and Urban Design, and were entitled to recover damages in the amount of $675,000. The trial court subsequently filed a judgment on 10 June 2010 awarding Plaintiffs damages in the amount of $675,000.\nPlaintiffs filed and served a notice of appeal on 23 September 2010 seeking review of the 19 April 2010 order allowing Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment as to the SPCA claim. On 1 July 2011, this Court allowed Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to withdraw their appeal against all Defendants except Hunter. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n\u201cSummary judgment is properly granted when the forecast of evidence reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact, and when the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, 835 (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt has been said that a genuine issue is one which can be maintained by substantial evidence. Where the pleadings or proof of either party disclose that no cause of action or defense exists, a summary judgment may be granted[.]\u201d Kessing v. Mortgage Corp., 278 N.C. 523, 534-35, 180 S.E.2d 823, 830 (1971).\nPlaintiffs argue that the SPCA applies to the current situation, despite the fact that no sediment was deposited into a body of water. We disagree.\nThe preamble to the SPCA explains the purpose of the act:\nThe sedimentation of streams, lakes and other waters of this State constitutes a major pollution problem. Sedimentation occurs from the erosion or depositing of soil and other materials into the waters, principally from construction sites and road maintenance. ... It is the purpose of this Article to provide for the creation, administration, and enforcement of a program and for the adoption of minimal mandatory standards which will permit development of this State to continue with the least detrimental effects from pollution by sedimentation.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-51 (2011)(emphasis added). This Court has interpreted the preamble to the SPCA to mean that \u201cthe stated legislative intent behind the enactment of the SPCA ... is to protect against the sedimentation of our waterways.\u201d McHugh v. N.C. Dept. of E.H.N.R., 126 N.C. App. 469, 476, 485 S.E.2d 861, 866 (1997).\nPlaintiffs point to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-64.1 (2011) of the Act which provides that a person engaged in a \u201c[l]and-disturbing activity\u201d who \u201cfailed to retain sediment generated by the activity\u201d may be required \u201cto restore the waters and land affected by the failure so as to minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting pollution by sedimentation.\u201d Plaintiffs then reference N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-52(6) (2011) of the Act, which defines \u201cland-disturbing activity\u201d as \u201cany use of the land by any person in residential, industrial, educational, institutional or commercial development... that results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation.\u201d Plaintiffs claim these provisions show that a person may violate the SPCA by using or affecting land, with no requirement that there be a deposition of sediment into a body of water. Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 SPCA claim against Defendant Hunter is based on the \u201cland-disturbing activity\u201d engaged in by Defendants that disturbed more than one acre of land on the parcel in question. However, Plaintiffs\u2019 fail to recognize the second requirement of a land-disturbing activity\u2014that it may cause or contribute to sedimentation. Because the preamble to the SPCA provides that sedimentation results from the erosion or depositing of materials into water, it is clear that even a \u201cland-disturbing activity\u201d requires an element of deposition into a body of water.\nPlaintiffs cite to this Court\u2019s opinion in Williams v. Allen, 182 N.C. App. 121, 126, 641 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2007), where we observed that the SPCA authorizes the Sedimentation Control Commission to adopt rules for the control of erosion and sedimentation resulting from land-disturbing activities, and that this rule-making authority is not limited to circumstances where sedimentation actually reaches a waterway. This observation is clearly dicta, and consequently not binding authority. See Hayes v. Wilmington, 243 N.C. 525, 536, 91 S.E.2d 673, 682 (1956). The holding of the case is that the trial court erred by ruling that the SPCA only applies to areas of more than one acre as a matter of law. Williams, 182 N.C. App. at 127, 641 S.E.2d at 394. Moreover, the observation does not shed any light on the case sub judice because this case is not about what the Sedimentation Control Commission could theoretically regulate. Instead, this case centers on the question of when the SPCA is applicable.\nPlaintiffs also point to several other cases that purportedly stand for the proposition that the SPCA applies to activities that affect only land and do not involve the infiltration of sediment into water. These cases are easily distinguishable from the instant case because they involved the deposition of sediment into water. See Banks v. Dunn, 177 N.C. App. 252, 630 S.E.2d 1 (2006)(stating that uncontroverted evidence established that the red clay mud dumped by defendant washed down the hillside and into the stream at the bottom of the hill); Whiteside Estates, Inc. v. Highlands Cove, L.L.C., 146 N.C. App. 449, 553 S.E.2d 431 (2001)(recognizing that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find defendant liable for trespass when defendant\u2019s land-disturbing activities caused sediment to enter a lake on plaintiffs property).\nAccordingly, we find that the SPCA does not apply to this situation and we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiffs\u2019 SPCA claim.\nAffirmed.\nJudge ERVIN dissents with separate opinion.\nJudge Thigpen, Jr. concurs.\n. Because the claims decided by the 10 June 2010 judgment are not before this Court, we address only the propriety of this appeal regarding the 19 April 2010 order.", "author": "BEASLEY, Judge.", "type": "majority"}, {"text": "ERVIN, Judge,\ndissenting.\nAfter a careful review of the record in light of the applicable law, I am compelled to conclude, contrary to the result reached by my colleagues, that the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973 (\u201cSPCA\u201d), N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-50 et. seq. (2011), does, in fact apply to situations like the one at issue here. Simply put, I believe that the damage liability provisions of the SPCA are not limited to situations in which sediment is deposited into a body of water. As a result, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to affirm the trial court\u2019s summary judgment order on the basis that Defendant\u2019s activities did not result in the deposition of sediment into a river, lake, stream, or pond.\nAs I understand the record, Defendants were involved in the development of a large tract of land that was located adjacent to Plaintiffs\u2019 golf course. In order to develop the tract, Defendants obtained an approved erosion and sedimentation control plan from the Gaston County Natural Resources Department as required by the Gaston County Erosion and Sedimentation Control Program. In accordance with this approved plan, Defendants constructed silt collection basins on the tract. On 28 March 2006, the Gaston County Natural Resources Department inspected the site and found that all \u201creasonable measures\u201d had not been taken to control erosion and sedimentation and that \u201ca revision with an added berm with stone wier to the draw in the center of the property to reduce the concentrated flow to the basin\u201d was required. Another onsite inspection found that, as of 5 May 2006, the site was being properly maintained in compliance with the plan. However, the applicable inspection report did note that Defendants needed to \u201c[m]ake sure all basins are cleaned and maintained, per our conversation.\u201d\nOn 27 June 2006, one of the silt collection basins at the site ruptured, causing a large volume of mud, water, sediment, and other debris to spill onto and damage Plaintiffs\u2019 golf course. On 29 June 2006, the Gaston County Natural Resources Department issued an inspection report which noted that severe sedimentation damage, in the form of \u201coffsite sediment- [disposal] onto [the] neighboring golf course\u201d had occurred since the last inspection; determined that the development site did not comply \u201cwith SESCO/SPCA & Rules;\u201d and cited Defendants for (1) failing to take sufficient measures to retain sediment on the site as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-57(3) and (2) failing to take reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage as required by 15A NCAC 04B.0105. As a result, the Gaston County Natural Resources Department served Defendants with a notice of non-compliance requiring Defendants to \u201c[r]estore adequate sediment control measures, to retain sediment on site\u201d and to \u201c[m]ake sure all areas are cleaned and restored per approved plan.\u201d\nAlthough some repair work was undertaken following the rupture, storms continued to fill the basin, which overflowed onto Plaintiffs\u2019 golf course on a number of additional occasions during the ensuing months. The Gaston County Natural Resources Department found the existence of a violation stemming from the fact that no revised plan to correct the previous violations had been submitted on 13 July 2006. On 23 August 2006, another inspection report indicated that Defendants were not \u201cin compliance with SESCO/SPCA & Rules\u201d given that Defendant had failed (1) to submit a revised plan; (2) to provide adequate groundcover; (3) to take all reasonable measures to protect public and private property from damage; and (4) to maintain erosion control measures. Although the report stated that the \u2019\u201c[s]ite appealed] to be stable since [the] basin [] blew out... [,] \u201d the Gaston County Natural Resources Department noted that the \u201c[o]utlet pipe in [the] basin [] is not installed per plan\u201d and that, given \u201cthe volume of water coming onto the neighboring golf course, an adjustment in the pipe needs to be made.\u201d The Gaston County Natural Resources Department continued to issue violation notices relating to the site at which the rupture occurred through March 2009.\nIn seeking an award of damages based on the SPCA, Plaintiffs alleged that the golf course was damaged by \u201csilt, mud, debris, and water\u201d as the result of the basin rupture and overflow and that Defendants had (1) \u201cengaged in land-disturbing activity that disturbed more than one acre of land on the parcel without installing erosion and sedimentation control devices and practices that were sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the parcel\u201d and (2) \u201cbegan land-disturbing activity that disturbed mor\u00e9 than one acre on the parcel without filing or complying with erosion and sedimentation control plans with the governing agency.\u201d As a result of the fact that Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to establish the existence of facts necessary to support these allegations appears to be undisputed, the ultimate issue raised by the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of Defendant Hunter with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 SPCA claim is whether such a showing suffices to establish damage liability under the SPCA.\nAccording to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-66(a):\nAny person injured by a violation of this Article or any ordinance, rule, or order duly adopted by the Secretary or a local government, or by the initiation or continuation of a land- disturbing activity for which an erosion and sedimentation control plan is required other than in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, may bring a civil action against the person alleged to be in violation (including the State and any local government). The action may seek any of the following:\n(1) Injunctive relief.\n(2) An order enforcing the law, rule, ordinance, order, or erosion and sedimentation control plan violated.\n(3) Damages caused by the violation.\nThus, according to the literal language of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-66(a), any person who sustains an injury stemming from (1) a violation of any of the SPCA\u2019s provisions; (2) a violation of any rule or ordinance adopted by the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources or a local governmental body authorized by the SPCA; or (3) any land-disturbing activity for which an erosion and sedimentation control plan is required which is not conducted in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan has a right to seek an award of damages from the responsible party. \u2022\nAccording to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-52(6), a land-disturbing activity includes \u201cany use of the land by any person in residential, industrial, educational, institutional or commercial development, highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation.\u201d As a result, any use of land which could cause sedimentation is subject to the SPCA, with the extent to which sedimentation actually occurs essentially irrelevant to the determination of whether a particular activity is \u201cland-disturbing.\u201d In the event that any \u201cland-disturbing activity\u201d that will disturb more than one acre is undertaken, \u201cthe person conducting [the activity] shall install erosion and sedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of the tract[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-57(3). In addition, any land-disturbing activity must \u201cbe conducted in accordance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-57(5). \u201cA local government may submit... an erosion and sedimentation control program for its jurisdiction\u201d for approval, with \u201clocal governments [being] authorized to adopt ordinances and regulations necessary to establish and enforce erosion and sedimentation control programs\u201d so long as they \u201cmeet [or] exceed the minimum requirements of [the SPCA] and the rules adopted pursuant to [the SPCA].\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-60(a). As a result, given that the SPCA requires that any person who undertakes a land-disturbing activity \u201cinstall erosion and sedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract. . .\u201d and to conduct activities \u201cin accordance with an approved erosion and sedimentation control plan,\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-57(3), (5), the literal language of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-66(a) clearly permits an injured party to seek an award of damages in the event that such a party sustains loss or damage stemming from another\u2019s failure to install sedimentation control devices and practices sufficient to retain sediment on a disturbed tract or to follow an approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.\nAccording to Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the golf course was damaged by \u201csilt, mud, debris, and water\u201d as the result of the rupture and overflow of the basin. As we have already noted, Plaintiff alleged that Defendants had (1) \u201cengaged in land-disturbing activity that disturbed more than one acre of land on the parcel without installing erosion and sedimentation control devices and practices that were sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the parcel\u201d and (2) \u201cbegan land-disturbing activity that disturbed more than one acre on the parcel without filing or complying with erosion and sedimentation control plans with the governing agency.\u201d At the time of the hearing that led to the trial court\u2019s decision to enter summary judgment in favor of Defendants with respect to the issue of their liability to Plaintiffs under the SPCA, Plaintiffs\u2019 forecast sufficient evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to them, to support a determination that the damage to Plaintiffs\u2019 golf course resulted from Defendants\u2019 failure to (1) take sufficient measures to retain sediment on site; (2) take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage stemming from Defendants\u2019 land-disturbing activities; and (3) follow an approved erosion and sedimentation control plan. Thus, I believe that Plaintiff has stated a claim for and forecast sufficient evidence to establish a viable claim for relief pursuant to the SPCA. Kessing v. Mortgage Corp., 278 N.C. 523, 534-35, 180 S.E.2d 823, 830 (1971).\nIn reaching a contrary determination, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs do not have a viable damage claim against Defendants pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-66(a) because the deposition of sedi- merit into a body of water is an indispensable element of such a claim. The Court appears to reach this conclusion because (1) N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-51, which delineates the policy considerations that motivated the enactment of the SPCA, states that sedimentation consists of \u201cthe erosion or depositing of soil and other materials into the waters;\u201d (2) we have interpreted N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-51 to mean that \u201cthe stated legislative intent behind the enactment of the SPCA ... is to protect against the sedimentation of our waterways;\u201d McHugh v. N.C. Dept of E.H.N.R., 126 N.C. App. 469, 476, 485 S.E.2d 861, 866 (1997); (3) the definition of \u201cland-disturbing activity\u201d contained in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-52(6) incorporates such a \u201cdeposition into a body of water\u201d requirement given that it references N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-51; and (4) the decisions of this Court upon which Plaintiffs rely are distinguishable from the present case because they all involved the deposition of sediment into water. I do not find the Court\u2019s analysis persuasive.\nI simply do not read N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-51, the definition of \u201cland-disturbing activity\u201d set out in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-52(6), or the language of our prior opinions addressing SPCA-related issues in the same manner that my colleagues do. As has been previously demonstrated, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-66(a) authorizes a damage recovery stemming from any injury resulting from a violation of the SPCA; a violation of an ordinance, rule, or order duly adopted by a local government; or the initiation or continuation of a land-disturbing activity in the absence of compliance with an appropriate erosion and sedimentation control plan. Although N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-51 does state that \u201c[c]ontrol of erosion and sedimentation is deemed vital to the public interest and necessary to the public health and welfare\u201d and that \u201cthe purpose of [the SPCA is] to provide for the creation, administration, and enforcement of a program and for the adoption of minimal mandatory standards which will permit development of this State to continue with the least detrimental effects from pollution by sedimentation,\u201d the relevant statutory language simply does not indicate that the provisions of the SPCA only apply to situations involving \u201cerosion or depositing of soil and other materials into the waters.\u201d Instead, it is clear to me that the relevant statutory provisions, taken as a whole, are directed at activities that both result in and create a risk of erosion and sedimentation. I believe that the validity of this assertion is confirmed by the fact that a \u201cland-disturbing activity\u201d subject to the provisions of the SPCA is one which \u201cmay cause or contribute to sedimentation,\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-52(6) (emphasis added), rather than one which actually does result in sedimentation. For that reason, the reference to \u201csedimentation\u201d in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-52(6) cannot be understood to incorporate a \u201cdeposition into a body of water\u201d requirement. Finally, the fact that the relevant decisions of this Court have, to date, involved actual sedimentation rather than the risk of such a result provides no indication that the damage claim made available by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-66(a) is not available to a party, such as Plaintiffs, who sustained injury as the result of non-compliance with the requirements of the SPCA.\nThus, for the reasons set forth above, I believe that Plaintiff has forecast sufficient evidence, if believed, to establish a right to recover damages pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 113A-66(a) in the event that Defendant Hunter is a covered entity. As a result, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to the contrary and would proceed to an examination of the remaining coverage issue that is also debated in the parties\u2019 briefs.\n. Although Plaintiffs contend in their reply brief that a body of water was, in fact, adversely affected by Defendants\u2019 activities, I do not believe that we need to address the extent, if any, to which Plaintiffs established that Defendants\u2019 alleged noncompliance with the SPCA affected a stream or wetland given my belief that impact upon a body of water is not a necessary component of Plaintiffs\u2019 SPCA claim.", "author": "ERVIN, Judge,", "type": "dissent"}], "parties": ["APPLEWOOD PROPERTIES, LLC and APPLECREEK EXECUTIVE GOLF CLUB, LLC, Plaintiffs v.

Department of Correction, N.C. Department of Correction\u2014Management Information Systems, Alvin W. Keller, and Bob Brinson (Defendants) motion for judgment on the pleadings. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nPlaintiffs are inmates in the N.C. Department of Correction (DOC). On 10 December 2010, Plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants. After Defendants filed an answer, both parties filed motions for judgment on the pleadings. The case was heard on 4 April 2011 and the trial court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings by order filed 9 May 2011. On 26 May 2011, Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.\nFirst, Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred by declaring that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3 (12) was inapplicable to sentences imposed under structured sentencing. We disagree.\n\u201cThis Court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo.\u201d Carpenter v. Carpenter, 189 N.C. App. 755, 757, 659 S.E.2d 762, 764 (2008) (citation omitted). \u201cJudgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), is appropriate when all the material allegations of fact are admitted in the pleadings and only questions of law remain.\u201d Groves v. Community Hous. Corp., 144 N.C. App. 79, 87, 548 S.E.2d 535, 540 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citations and omitted).\nPlaintiffs assert that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3(12) applies to the Structured Sentencing Act (the Act) where the Act fails to expressly define the term \u201cmonth.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3(12) (2011) states,\n\u201cImprisonment for One Month,\u201d How Construed.\u2014The words \u201cimprisonment for one month,\u201d wherever used in any of the statutes, shall be construed to mean \u201cimprisonment for thirty days.\u201d\nPlaintiffs contend that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3(12) limits the DOC\u2019s ability to convert sentences of a year or more. Currently, the DOC calculates every 12 month sentence into a calendar year which consists of 365 days. Under Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed interpretation of the statute, DOC is not permitted to convert months over a year into 365 days, but is limited to construing months into 30 day periods. Plaintiffs assert that sentences over 12 months, under this interpretation of the statute, should consist of 360 days (12 months x 30 days), not 365 days.\nWe must first note that\n[t]he functions of the court in regard to the punishment of crimes are to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, and, if that determination be one of guilt, then to pronounce the punishment or penalty prescribed by law. The execution of the sentence belongs to a different department of the government. The manner of executing the sentence and the mitigation of punishment are determined by the legislative department, and what the Legislature has determined in that regard must be put in force and effect by administrative officers.\nJernigan v. State, 279 N.C. 556, 563-64, 184 S.E.2d 259, 265 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Additionally, \u201cthe responsibility for determining the limits of statutory grants of authority to an administrative agency is a judicial function for the courts to perform.\u201d In re Community Association, 300 N.C. 267, 280, 266 S.E.2d 645, 654 (1980).\nDefendants argue, and we agree, that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3(3) controls and N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3 (12) is inapplicable. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3(3) (2011) states,\nThe word \u201cmonth\u201d shall be construed to mean a calendar month, unless otherwise expressed; and the word \u201cyear,\u201d a calendar year, unless otherwise expressed. . . . When a statute refers to a period of one or more months and the last month does not have a date corresponding to the initial date, the period shall expire on the last day of the last month.\n\u201cIn North Carolina, when the word \u2018month\u2019 is used in our General Statutes it is to be construed to mean a calendar month, unless otherwise expressed.\u201d Kennedy v. Insurance Co., 4 N.C. App. 77, 80, 165 S.E.2d 676, 677 (1969) (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3(3)). In Kennedy, this Court held that\nthe term \u2018thirty days\u2019 and the term \u2018one month\u2019 are not synonymous, although where the particular calendar month is composed of exactly thirty days the number of days involved happen to be the same. The word \u2018month\u2019 has a clear and well-defined meaning, and refers to a particular time. Unless an intention to the contrary is expressed, it signifies a calendar month, regardless of the number of days it contains.\nId. at 80-81, 165 S.E.2d at 677.\nPlaintiffs acknowledge the plain meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3(3), but argue that \u00a7 12-3(12) is also controlling in defining months. Plaintiffs argue that the two statutes should be \u201charmonized\u201d. We recognize the rule of statutory interpretation that states \u201c[w]here there is one statute dealing with a subject in general and comprehensive terms, and another dealing with a part of the same subject in a more minute and definite way, the two should be read together and harmonized[.]\u201d McIntyre v. McIntyre, 341 N.C. 629, 631, 461 S.E.2d 745, 747 (1995). We find the rule inapplicable in this case because we determine that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3 (12) does not deal with the same subject matter as N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3(3).\n\u201cWhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for judicial construction and the courts must construe the statute using its plain meaning.\u201d Burgess v. Your House of Raleigh, 326 N.C. 205, 209, 388 S.E.2d 134, 136 (1990). It is clear from the plain language of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3 (12) that the statute defines the term \u201cimprisonment for one month\u201d and does not define the term \u201cmonth\u201d. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3 (12) \u201cimprisonment for one month\u201d is used as a term of art. \u201cA complimentary rule of construction provides that when technical terms or terms of art are used in a statute, they are presumed to be used with their technical meaning in mind, likewise absent legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d Dare County Bd. of Educ. v. Sakaria, 127 N.C. App. 585, 588, 492 S.E.2d 369, 371-72 (1997). The statute expressly states that \u201c[t]he words \u2018imprisonment for one month,\u2019 wherever used in any of the statutes, shall be construed to mean \u201cimprisonment for thirty days.\u201d A plain reading of the statute shows that \u201cimprisonment for one month\u201d is a term of art and delineates that the thirty day rule is only to be used where the term of art is expressly used in the statutes. We decline to extend this narrow and specific definition outlined in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12-3 (12) to a broader interpretation that was not intended by the Legislature. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order and Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is overruled.\nBecause Plaintiffs\u2019 second issue on appeal is based on the first issue, Plaintiffs\u2019 second issue on appeal is also overruled.\nAffirmed.\nJudges HUNTER, Robert C. and STEPHENS concur.\n.

Search and Seizure\u2014motion to suppress\u2014gun\u2014vehicle search\u2014consent\u2014contraband in car panels\nThe trial court did not err in an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder case by denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle, including a gun. A reasonable person would not have considered defendant\u2019s statements that the officers were \u201ctearing up\u201d his car to be an unequivocal revocation of his consent. Further, it was reasonable for a detective to believe contraband could have been hidden behind the car panels after having found marijuana and a stolen license plate in the front section of the vehicle.\n2. Accomplices and Accessories\u2014accessory after the fact to first-degree murder\u2014motion to dismiss\u2014sufficiency of evidence\u2014knowledge that gun in vehicle used in murder\nThe trial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of accessory after the fact to first-degree murder based on alleged insufficiency of the evidence that defendant knew the gun found in his vehicle had been used in a murder. The totality of the evidence gave rise to a reasonable inference that defendant knew precisely what had taken place.\n3. Evidence\u2014prior crimes or bad acts\u2014other thefts and break-ins\u2014corroboration\u2014motive\u2014opportunity\u2014intent\u2014 knowledge\nThe trial court did not err in an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder case by admitting evidence of other thefts and break-ins, including alleged crimes committed after the time of the charged offense. The evidence was admissible to corroborate the testimony of several other witnesses and was relevant to show defendant\u2019s motive, opportunity, intent, and knowledge because the shooter in the first-degree murder case had incriminating evidence against defendant in having been involved in a break-in.\n4. Constitutional Law\u2014right to unanimous verdict\u2014jury instruction\u2014failure to distinguish between two murder theories\nThe trial court did not err in an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder case by instructing the jury that it was immaterial that the verdict sheet did not distinguish between the two murder theories of the underlying felony even though defendant contended that it allowed the jury to return a non-unanimous verdict. The indictment stated the \u201cfelony of murder\u201d and not the \u201cfelony murder rule.\u201d Further, it would not have affected the jury unanimously finding defendant guilty of knowingly and willingly assisting the shooter in attempting to escape detection and/or arrest by hiding the firearm.\nAppeal by defendant from judgment entered 14 January 2011 by Judge James M.

We find no error.\nI. Background\nOn the morning of Friday, 21 September 2007, in Carthage, North Carolina, Michael Graham Currie and Sherrod Harrison broke into the home of Emily Haddock, who was home sick from school. Currie proceeded to shoot Haddock twice in the head with a .22 caliber handgun, resulting in her death. Defendant, Currie, Harrison, Ryan White, and Van Roger Smith, Jr., were all initially charged with first-degree murder. Defendant\u2019s charge for first-degree murder was dropped a few days before trial. Currie ultimately escaped being tried for capital murder by confessing and agreeing to testify against defendant. Currie, however, did receive a sentence of life without parole. Currie gave two statements to police on 22 October 2007, but in neither statement did he tell police anything about conveying to defendant that the gun had been used in a murder. Currie allegedly did not alert authorities to having told defendant about the gun until he began discussing his plea bargain with the district attorney. Furthermore, in a 26 June 2009 letter to the district attorney, Currie falsely claimed defendant was the one \u201cwho broke in and shot and killed Emily Haddock.\u201d However, Currie admitted to the fallacy at trial. Defendant did not testify at trial, but he had previously provided law enforcement with a signed statement.\nCurrie obtained the murder weapon during a 20 September 2007 break-in of David Ball\u2019s home with Harrison, where they also stole other goods. The gun had a distinct look to it; mainly that it had a gold trigger. After the shooting, Currie held onto the gun, but then gave it to Harrison. Not much later he got the gun back from Harrison and gave it to White, telling him that he could do \u201c[wjhatever he wanted\u201d with it. Prior to giving the gun to White, though, Currie had been handling it in front of defendant and others while wearing white gloves, which they found to be strange. Defendant and Currie stayed in a hotel in Spring Lake, North Carolina, over the weekend. While there Currie called White and told him to give the gun to defendant.\nDefendant went by White\u2019s house to pick up the gun and subsequently shot the gun once inside of a Wendy\u2019s bag. Defendant then returned to the hotel with the gun. Currie testified that while he and defendant were in the hotel room he told defendant \u201cwhere the gun was from\u201d and at some point before they were locked up \u201cthat Sherrod [Harrison] did that shooting.\u201d Furthermore, he testified that he \u201ctold [defendant] the next night at the hotel\u2014Sunday night I told him what happened. I told him me and Sherrod were involved and Ryan had the gun.\u201d Defendant also learned at some point before being arrested that a Moore County detective was looking for Currie. Currie had told defendant to toss the gun somewhere Currie could find it, so Currie could get rid of it.\nDefendant left the hotel early Monday morning with the gun in a Nike bag. At some point that morning, defendant went by Jamel Allen\u2019s house where he put the gun in a sock and hid it in the trunk of his car. He then went to eat with some friends where they discussed needing to stay away from Currie because he was acting weird and wearing white gloves. He stated that had he known at the time that Haddock had been shot, he would have thought Currie was involved in the shooting. Soon thereafter, he and White got in the car to ride around looking for Currie, but they could not find him and thus returned to White\u2019s house. About five minutes later, the Harnett County Sheriff\u2019s Office pulled up and started questioning defendant about his car and Currie\u2019s whereabouts. Detective Lieutenant Joe Webb asked defendant for the keys to his car, so defendant told his little brother to give them to Lieutenant Webb. Lieutenant Webb and Detective Justin Toler then opened defendant\u2019s trunk to find the gun hidden in the wheel well.\nThe trial court held a pretrial hearing regarding defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from the car. Conflicting evidence was presented regarding the consent necessary to search the vehicle. Detective Toler testified that the search was based on consent, but his report stated it was incident to arrest. Upon hearing all the evidence, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. The trial court entered oral findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nIn summary, the trial court found that upon determining that the license plate on defendant\u2019s car was stolen, officers placed defendant under arrest and Lieutenant Webb accompanied defendant to the rear of defendant\u2019s car. Detective Toler searched the driver\u2019s side of the car where he found a marijuana bud under the seat. He continued to search the backseat where he found a vanity license plate containing the words \u201cHOTT CHIC,\u201d which belonged to a stolen Lexus found on 24 September 2007, after being wrecked and burned. Lieutenant Webb asked defendant for consent to search the rest of his vehicle, to which defendant acquiesced. Another patrol car arrived and defendant was placed in the passenger seat, about 10-15 feet away from the trunk of his car. Lieutenant Webb obtained the keys and opened defendant\u2019s trunk to search it. While authorities were searching his vehicle, defendant complained to Lieutenant Darren Ritter, who was sitting in the patrol car with defendant, that they were \u201ctearing up\u201d his cax. Both rear quarter panels of the trunk were fitted with carpet/cardboard type interior trim, which were loose. Detective Toler found the gun behind the right rear quarter panel. Defendant was within range to verbally withdraw consent. Defendant told Lieutenant Ritter that he was a convicted felon, that his fingerprints should not be on the gun, and that he did not know anything about the gun. Lieutenant Ritter testified that defendant was visibly sweating and shaking.\nThe trial court found that the search of the driver\u2019s area of the vehicle was lawful subsequent to defendant\u2019s arrest. Additionally, the search of the interior was lawful after finding the marijuana and the search of the trunk was based on voluntary consent. Furthermore, the search of the entire vehicle was justified based on the interest of seeking evidence of contraband and crime after finding the license plate from the stolen car along with marijuana.\nMoreover, at trial, the State presented evidence that defendant had been involved in the theft of the Lexus connected to the license plate \u201cHOTT CHIC.\u201d Olivia Marie Elliott-Priest, a friend of Currie and defendant, testified that she had seen defendant driving around in a white Lexus, which she had never seen him in. Defendant usually drove a green Cadillac. She also testified to defendant and Currie having arrived at her house earlier in the week late at night, after having wrecked the Lexus about two minutes away. White had then picked defendant and Currie up in defendant\u2019s Cadillac.\nAnother issue arose at trial regarding the admission of evidence and testimony pertaining to defendant\u2019s involvement in the robbery of David Wayne Oakley\u2019s house. Defendant filed a motion in limine to prevent mention of these details. The trial court initially sustained an objection to the admission of the evidence due to hearsay, but eventually let the evidence in based on its corroborating other testimony and showing the chain of circumstances of the weekend. The robbery included the taking of nearly a dozen guns and over one thousand rounds of ammunition. Mr. Oakley\u2019s neighbor, John Vincent Gallant, III, testified to having seen defendant outside Mr. Oakley\u2019s house and telling him to leave. Major Jeffrey Huber testified that he found a rifle and a pair of black bootie socks in the area where Mr. Gallant had seen defendant.\nDefendant pled not guilty to the charges, but a jury found him guilty on 3 January 2011. The trial court sentenced defendant to 116 to 149 months in prison. Defendant appeals.\nII. Analysis\nA. Motion to Suppress\nDefendant raises four issues on appeal with the first being that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle. Defendant contends the gun obtained during the search of his vehicle was the result of an illegal search and seizure. For the following reasons, we disagree.\nWhen reviewing an appeal from the denial of a motion to suppress, the findings of fact are binding if supported by competent evidence and the conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. State v. Barnhill, 166 N.C. App. 228, 230-31, 601 S.E.2d 215, 217 (2004). The State has the burden of showing the constitutionality of a search. State v. Cooke, 306 N.C. 132, 136, 291 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1982). Furthermore, the review of a search should be for constitutional errors, which the State has the burden of proving are \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(b) (2011).\nDefendant first argues that warrantless searches are presumed to be unconstitutional. In arguing so, defendant notes that \u201c[a] search and seizure 1 \u201cconducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by a judge or magistrate, [is] per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u2014subject only to a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d State v. Summey, 150 N.C. App. 662, 666, 564 S.E.2d 624, 627 (2002) (quoting Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 372, 124 L. Ed. 2d 334, 343-44 (1993) (citations omitted)). Here, authorities did not obtain a search warrant, court order, written waiver, or acknowledgment to search defendant\u2019s vehicle. However, an officer may conduct a search and seizure based on consent. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-221(a) (2011). Consent refers to \u201ca statement to the officer, made voluntarily and in accordance with the requirements of G.S. 15A-222, giving the officer permission to make a search.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-221(b). Moreover, \u201cconsent . . . must be freely and intelligently given, without coercion, duress or fraud, and the burden is upon the State to prove that it was so, the presumption being against the waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d State v. Vestal, 278 N.C. 561, 578-79, 180 S.E.2d 755, 767 (1971).\nIn the case at hand, officers testified to receiving consent from defendant to search his vehicle. Defendant even showed officers which key opened the trunk of his car. Defendant, alternatively, contends he revoked his consent while sitting, arrested, in a nearby patrol car when he \u201csaid several times, \u2018They\u2019re\u2014man, they\u2019re tearing up my trunk.\u2019 \u201d Defendant correctly notes that a person may withdraw his or her consent to a search. State v. Hagin, 203 N.C. App. 561, 564, 691 S.E.2d 429, 433, disc. review denied, 364 N.C. 438, 702 S.E.2d 500 (2010). \u201cThe scope of a valid consent search is measured against a standard of objective reasonableness where the court asks \u2018what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect?\u2019 \u201d Id. at 564, 691 S.E.2d at 432 (quoting Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251, 114 L. Ed. 2d 297, 302 (1991)). A reasonable person would not have considered defendant\u2019s statements that the officers were \u201ctearing up\u201d his car to be an unequivocal revocation of his consent. Similarly, in State v. Morocco, 99 N.C. App. 421, 430, 393 S.E.2d 545, 550 (1990), our Court held that the trial court did not err in determining that the defendant did not revoke his consent to search his vehicle when he made the ambiguous statement that a tote bag found in his car had nude photographs of his wife. Had defendant, in the case at bar, desired to revoke his consent he should have made it in a clearer statement that a reasonable person would have considered to be a revocation.\nDefendant also argues the trial court erred in failing to note that law enforcement records stated that the search was incident to arrest, and at the same time failing to note that the search was based upon consent. Defendant contends the search was not allowed as incident to an arrest, pursuant to Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485 (2009). Furthermore, in Gant the Court set out a two-prong test under which \u201c[p]olice may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.\u201d Id. at 351, 173 L. Ed. 2d at 501. We agree that the search of defendant\u2019s trunk was not valid as incident to arrest, but we do not think the trial court erred in failing to address law enforcement\u2019s noting that the search was incident to arrest. The trial court thoroughly addressed the motion to suppress and determined that the search was valid based on defendant\u2019s consent and lack of revocation.\nFinally, defendant claims the officers\u2019 search of his trunk was excessive in taking off the rear quarter panels. Defendant argues his case is similar to State v. Johnson, 177 N.C. App. 122, 627 S.E.2d 488, disc. review allowed, vacated and remanded, 360 N.C. 541, 634 S.E.2d 889 (2006), where \u201ca plastic wall panel was removed by a law enforcement officer from the interior of defendant\u2019s van, thereby facilitating discovery of the cocaine. \u2018[A]n individual consenting to a vehicle search should expect that search to be thorough[; however,] he need not anticipate that the search will involve the destruction of his vehicle, its parts or contents.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 125, 627 S.E.2d at 490-91 (citations omitted) (quoting United States v. Strickland, 902 F.2d 937, 942 (11th Cir. 1990)). We, however, believe defendant\u2019s case can be distinguished in that here the trial court found \u201cthat both the left and right quarter panels of the interior of the trunk were fitted with carpet/cardboard type interior trim\u201d and that they \u201cwere loose.\u201d Additionally, the trial court found that \u201cDetective Toler was easily able to pull back the carpet/cardboard type trim... covering the right rear quarter panel where he observed what appeared to be a sock with a pistol handle protruding from the sock.\u201d In Johnson, the search of the van appears to be much more invasive than the one in the case at hand. See id. at 123-24, 627 S.E.2d at 489-90. There, the officers had to pull back multiple glued down side panels of the van, while in the case at hand Detective Toler merely had to pull back a loose carpet/cardboard panel. See id. We do not believe Detective Toler\u2019s actions amount to the destruction present in Johnson. See id. Furthermore, it was reasonable for Detective Toler to believe contraband could be hidden behind the panels after having found marijuana and a stolen license plate in the front section of the vehicle. Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, as it was based on voluntary consent given by defendant.\nB. Motion to Dismiss\nDefendant next contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on insufficiency of the evidence. Specifically, defendant argues the State did not present sufficient evidence, that defendant knew the gun found in his vehicle had been used in a murder, for him to be convicted as an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. We disagree.\n\u201cThis Court reviews the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss de novo.\u201d State v. Smith, 186 N.C. App. 57, 62, 650 S.E.2d 29, 33 (2007). \u201cUpon defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal, the question for the Court is whether there is substantial evidence (1) of each essential element of the offense charged, or of a lesser offense included therein, and (2) of defendant\u2019s being the perpetrator of such offense. If so, the motion is properly denied.\u201d State v. Powell, 299 N.C. 95, 98, 261 S.E.2d 114, 117 (1980). \u201cIf the evidence is sufficient only to raise a suspicion or conjecture as to either the commission of the offense or the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of it, the motion should be allowed.\u201d Id. The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State. State v. Rose, 339 N.C. 172, 192, 451 S.E.2d 211, 223 (1994).\nIn order to prove a person was an accessory after the fact under G.S. 14-7 [] three essential elements must be shown: (1) a felony was committed; (2) the accused knew that the person he received, relieved or assisted was the person who committed the felony; and (3) the accused rendered assistance to the felon personally.\nState v. Earnhardt, 307 N.C. 62, 68, 296 S.E.2d 649, 653 (1982).\nDefendant argues all the evidence presented by the State merely amounts to speculation that defendant knew the gun was used in Emily Haddock\u2019s murder and is not substantial evidence of the third element of the offense. First, defendant testified and put in his statement that he thought Haddock had been beaten to death, not shot. He further stated he told friends that he would kill whoever beat Haddock to death because he had a sister of a similar age. Defendant also notes that Currie\u2019s testimony was based on a plea bargain and was. conflicting in certain areas. Defendant did not destroy the gun and was cooperative with law enforcement. Defendant admitted to having fired the gun in a Wendy\u2019s bag, which he argues is not something a felon would do if he knew the gun was a murder weapon.\nThe State, on the other hand, contends there is substantial direct evidence through Currie and defendant\u2019s statements for the jury to find that defendant knew the gun had been used in a murder. As mentioned above, Currie testified to having told defendant that the gun was used in Haddock\u2019s murder sometime before they were arrested. He testified that it could have been while they were in the hotel together over the weekend. Detective Toler found the gun in the trunk of defendant\u2019s car where defendant had hidden it in a sock in the wheel well. \u201cIt is not necessary that the aid be effective to enable the felon to escape all or part of his punishment.\u201d State v. Martin, 30 N.C. App. 166, 169, 226 S.E.2d 682, 684 (1976) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Defendant was not successful in helping Currie escape punishment, but he did knowingly aid Currie by hiding the murder weapon. They even discussed Currie getting the gun back, so he could properly dispose of it. Defendant had seen Currie handling the gun over the weekend with white gloves on. Consequently, \u201c[t]he totality of the evidence ... is such to give rise to a reasonable inference that defendant knew precisely what had taken place.\u201d Earnhardt, 307 N.C. at 68, 296 S.E.2d at 653. The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as the evidence was sufficient to constitute more than speculation and to be presented to the jury.\nC. Admission of Other Crimes\nDefendant\u2019s third argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of other thefts and break-ins, including alleged crimes committed after the time of the charged offense. We disagree.\nRule 404(b) is a \u201cgeneral rule of inclusion of relevant evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts by a defendant, subject to but one exception requiring its exclusion if its only probative value is to show that the defendant has the propensity or disposition to commit an offense of the nature of the crime charged.\u201d State v. Coffey, 326 N.C. 268, 278-79, 389 S.E.2d 48, 54 (1990). Additionally, \u201cRule 404(b) . . . allows for the admission of prior bad acts to show a defendant\u2019s \u2018motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake, entrapment or accident.\u2019 \u201d State v. Renfro, 174 N.C. App. 402, 405, 621 S.E.2d 221, 223 (2005) (quoting N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404(b) (2003)), aff\u2019d, 360 N.C. 395, 627 S.E.2d 463 (2006).\nDefendant filed a motion in limine to preclude the mention of any prior bad acts because he believed the State\u2019s use of the prior bad acts would be for the purpose of showing his bad character. The trial court did not specifically address defendant\u2019s motion prior to trial, but dealt with issues pertaining to prior bad acts as they came up and defendant objected. Defendant objected to two specific instances with the first being the State\u2019s questioning of Officer Toler regarding the breaking in of David Oakley\u2019s house on the Saturday night after Haddock\u2019s death. In the situation in question, some guns and ammunition were stolen from Mr. Oakley\u2019s house and a gun, along with two black socks and a tire tool, were found outside of his house. The State wanted Detective Toler to testify regarding what was found outside of Mr. Oakley\u2019s house. However, Detective Toler was not the officer that found the evidence outside of Mr. Oakley\u2019s home, so the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objection to Detective Toler testifying regarding this evidence. Consequently, this testimony and evidence does not appear to raise an issue.\nNonetheless, an issue regarding the same evidence came up the next day when the State presented John Gallant, Mr. Oakley\u2019s neighbor, to testify about having seen defendant outside Mr. Oakley\u2019s house where the gun, socks, and tire tool were found. At this point, defendant objected to the admission of this testimony based on it not falling under an exception to Rule 404(b). The State argued that the evidence should be admitted to show defendant\u2019s opportunities to gain knowledge about Currie\u2019s use of the gun. The State had already presented evidence of defendant\u2019s interaction Friday night with Currie, in which they wrecked the stolen Lexus and burned it. The State desired to present evidence of the break-in of Mr. Oakley\u2019s house to show that the two were together on Saturday, and then also present evidence that they were together Sunday night for a full chain of events of the weekend.\nEvidence of prior bad acts may be admitted for corroboration. See State v. Alston, 80 N.C. App. 540, 543, 342 S.E.2d 573, 575 (1986). Moreover, the same evidence may be admitted \u201cto establish the context or chain of circumstances of a crime[.]\u201d See State v. Agee, 326 N.C. 542, 547, 391 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1990). The State argues the evidence in question was admissible to corroborate the testimony of several other witnesses who testified regarding defendant and Currie\u2019s actions on Saturday night. The State also contends the evidence was relevant to show defendant\u2019s motive, opportunity, intent, and knowledge; specifically, that it gave defendant motive to aid Currie in hiding the murder weapon because Currie now had incriminating evidence against defendant in having been involved in the break-in of Mr. Oakley\u2019s house. We believe the trial court properly admitted Mr. Gallant\u2019s testimony for the purposes argued by the State and, additionally, any unfair prejudice was outweighed by the evidence\u2019s probative value. Thus, defendant\u2019s argument is without merit.\nD. Jury Instructions\nDefendant\u2019s final argument is that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it was immaterial that the verdict sheet did not distinguish between the two murder theories of the underlying felony. Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s instructions allowed the jury to return a non-unanimous verdict. We disagree.\n\u201cA party may not make any portion of the jury charge or omission therefrom the basis of an issue presented on appeal unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires].]\u201d N.C.R. App. R 10(a)(2) (2011). Our Supreme Court \u201chas elected to review unpreserved issues for plain error when they involve either (1) errors in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, or (2) rulings on the admissibility of evidence.\u201d State v. Gregory, 342 N.C. 580, 584, 467 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1996). Plain error occurs when the error is \u201c \u2018so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been done[.]\u2019 \u201d State v. Odom, 307 N.C. 655, 660, 300 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1983) (quoting United States v. McCaskill, 676 F.2d 995, 1002 (4th Cir. 1982)). \u201cUnder the plain error rule, defendant must convince this Court not only that there was error, but that absent the error, the jury probably would have reached a different result.\u201d State v. Jordan, 333 N.C. 431, 440, 426 S.E.2d 692, 697 (1993).\nDefendant claims the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it could convict defendant \u201ceither on the basis of malice, premeditation and deliberation and/or the felony murder rule\u201d even though the indictment only alleged \u201cthe felony murder rule.\u201d However, a closer reading of the indictment shows that it actually states the \u201cfelony of murder\u201d and not \u201cfelony murder rule.\u201d The indictment correctly cites to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-17, which describes the crime of murder, a felony. The underlying felony \u201cneed not be set out as fully and specifically as would be required in an indictment for the actual commission of that felony. It is enough to state the offense generally and to designate it by name.\u201d State v. Saults, 294 N.C. 722, 725, 242 S.E.2d 801, 804 (1978) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the indictment stated the underlying felony as \u201cthe felony of murder\u201d and cited to the proper statute for the charge of murder. While this may not have been the best wording of the indictment, we do not believe it specified the felony murder rule. Consequently, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that Currie could be found guilty \u201ceither on the basis of malice, premeditation and deliberation and/or the felony murder rule.\u201d That would not affect the jury unanimously finding defendant guilty of knowingly and willingly assisting Currie in attempting to escape detection and/or arrest by hiding the firearm. Consequently, the trial court did not err in its instructions to the jury.\nIII. Conclusion\nAccordingly, we find no error on behalf of the trial court. The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motions to suppress and dismiss; in allowing the admission of testimony regarding the break-in of Mr. Oakley\u2019s home; and in instructing the jury on the various theories of murder for which Currie could be convicted.\nNo error.\nJudges HUNTER (Robert C.) and THIGPEN concur.", "author": "McCULLOUGH, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Search and Seizure\u2014motion to suppress evidence and statements\u2014reasonable articulable suspicion\u2014flight\u2014 investigatory stop\u2014pat-down for dangerous items\nThe trial court did not err in an attempted felonious breaking or entering, possession of implements of housebreaking, and resisting a public officer case by denying defendant\u2019s motions to suppress evidence collected and defendant\u2019s statements. Defendant\u2019s flight, combined with the totality of circumstances, was sufficient to support a reasonable articulable suspicion and an investigatory stop. Once , the officer felt a screwdriver and wrench during the pat-down of defendant, he was justified in removing these items as they constituted both a potential danger to the officer and were further suggestive of criminal activity being afoot.\n2. Confessions and Incriminating Statements\u2014motion to suppress pre-Miranda statements\u2014admission of guilt\nAlthough the trial court erred in an attempted felonious breaking or entering, possession of implements of housebreaking, and resisting a public officer case by failing to grant defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his pr e-Miranda statements that he was breaking into Auto America and that he ran from an officer because he did not want to be caught, defendant was not prejudiced because defendant admitted his guilt after having been given his Miranda rights.\n3. Constitutional Law\u2014effective assistance of counsel\u2014 failure to object\nDefendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel in an attempted felonious breaking or entering and possession of implements of housebreaking case based on his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the tools and defendant\u2019s statements at trial. The screwdriver and wrench were properly seized pursuant to a constitutional stop and frisk, and defendant was not prejudiced by the admission of his pr e-Miranda statements.\n4. Indictment and Information\u2014misdemeanor resisting an officer\u2014general description of actions sufficient\nThe trial court did not err by failing to dismiss the charge of misdemeanor resisting an officer even though defendant contended the indictment for this charge was fatally defective. An indictment for resisting arrest must only include a general description of defendant\u2019s actions, and the indictment\u2019s general language was sufficient to put defendant on notice that the events surrounding his arrest would be brought out at trial.\nJudge HUNTER, Robert C., concurring in result in separate opinion.\nAppeal by Defendant from judgments entered 2 December 2010 by Judge Richard D.

Officer Adkins saw Defendant, wearing a white hoodie, peering around a white van. Officer Adkins was in a marked patrol car, and was wearing his standard police uniform. Officer Adkins testified:\nAs soon as [Defendant] saw me, he began to run. He ran around the left side of the business and continued to run behind the business. As soon as he took off, I chased after him.\nAs soon as he started running, I began to run after him, and I yelled out\u2014I gave him several verbal commands to stop. I identified myself as a police officer and told him to stop.\nHe continued to run. He ran around the building. We ran through the car lot, all the parked cars there, and he ran in front- of a Mexican restaurant and behind a dumpster there where I caught him.\nDefendant \u201cwas trying to hide behind a dumpster\u201d when Officer Adkins caught up with him. Officer Adkins had his Taser out, and put Defendant on the ground. While restraining Defendant with handcuffs, Officer Adkins asked Defendant why he was running. Defendant replied that he was breaking into Auto America and did not want to get caught. When Officer Adkins conducted a pat-down search, he recovered a ten-inch screwdriver from Defendant\u2019s back left pocket and a small wrench from Defendant\u2019s back right pocket. Officer Adkins walked Defendant back to the patrol car and advised Defendant of his Miranda rights. Additional officers arrived on the scene, and located a sledgehammer behind the white van where Officer Adkins had originally spotted Defendant. Near the sledgehammer, the officers found an approximately \u201cthree-foot by three-foot ... hole in the wall that went about two feet deep, and it actually punctured through the wooden paneling inside of what appeared to be an office.\u201d Officer Adkins then questioned Defendant about the sledgehammer and the hole in the wall of Auto America. Defendant \u201cstated that he brought the tools earlier in the day and that he hid them so that he could break into the business that night.\u201d\nDefendant was charged with attempted felonious breaking and entering, possession of implements of housebreaking, and resisting a public officer. Defendant was also charged with having attained habitual felon status. At trial, Defendant moved to suppress both evidence collected and Defendant\u2019s statements, arguing that the initial detention of Defendant was unconstitutional. Defendant\u2019s motions were denied. A jury found Defendant guilty of attempted felonious breaking or entering, possession of implements of housebreaking, resisting a public officer, and of having attained habitual felon status. Defendant appeals.\nI. Motions to Suppress\nDefendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress. We disagree.\nA. Standard of Review\n\u201c[T]he scope of appellate review of an order [on a motion to suppress evidence] is strictly limited to determining whether the trial judge\u2019s underlying findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, in which event they are conclusively binding on appeal, and whether those factual findings in turn support the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions of law.\u201d Defendant does not challenge any of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact in the order denying his motion to suppress. Defendant assigns error solely to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion. Accordingly, the only issues for review are whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact support its conclusions of law and whether those conclusions of law are legally correct.\nState v. Stanley, 175 N.C. App. 171, 174-75, 622 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2005) (citations omitted).\nB. Discussion\nFollowing the hearing on Defendant\u2019s motions to suppress, the trial court made the following findings of fact:\n1. On February 10th, 2009, Charles Adkins, an officer of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, was dispatched to a business located at 6802 South Boulevard in Charlotte, North Carolina. The business was a used car lot.\n2. The officer arrived at the business at approximately 10:10 p.m. in response to a suspicious persons call from an unknown citizen. When the officer arrived, the business was closed.\n3. The parking lot of the business was lighted. Officer Adkins saw the [Defendant peering around a white van parked at the business. He described the [Defendant as a heavyset black male wearing a white hoody.\n4. When Officer Adkins saw the [Defendant, the [Defendant began to run. Officer Adkins gave chase. The [Defendant ran down the side of the office of the used car lot and behind the building toward an adjacent business.\n5. Officer Adkins yelled for the [Defendant to stop and identified himself as a police officer. The [Defendant continued to run.\n6. Officer Adkins pursued the [Defendant approximately one-eighth of a mile to a dumpster located at the adjacent business. The [Defendant was observed trying to hide behind the dumpster.\n7. Officer Adkins subdued the [Defendant on the ground and handcuffed him. While handcuffing the [Defendant, Officer Adkins asked the [Defendant why he ran. The [Djefendant responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get caught because I was breaking into the business.\u201d\n8. Officer Adkins patted down the [Djefendant\u2019s person and felt objects in his pockets. The objects were removed from the [Djefendant\u2019s person. They were a wrench and a screwdriver.\n9. The officer took the [Djefendant to his patrol car where he was secured. Other police officers arrived at the scene.\n10. Office[rJ Adkins and another police officer found a large sledgehammer near the van where the [Djefendant had been observed previously, and the officers saw a large hole in a wall of the office building at the used car lot.\n11. Officer Adkins returned to the patrol car and gave the [Djefendant the Miranda rights warning. The [Djefendant indicated he understood the rights and was willing to speak with the officer.\n12. In response to questions, the [Djefendant said that he had ridden a bus to the used car lot. The [Djefendant stated that he had brought tools to the location earlier in the day and had hidden them so that he could use them to break into the business.\n13. Having placed the [Djefendant under arrest, the officer took the [Djefendant to jail.\n14. The [Djefendant never requested an attorney at any time during the questioning by Officer Adkins.\nBased upon the foregoing findings of fact, the trial court made the following conclusions of law:\n1. When Officer Adkins subdued the [Djefendant behind the dumpster, the officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity had taken place. Based upon the totality of the circumstances observed by the officer, including the time of day, the business where the [Djefendant was observed, the [Djefendant\u2019s actions behind the van and the fact that the [Djefendant attempted to flee, refusing to heed the officer\u2019s directive to stop, Officer Adkins was justified in detaining the [Djefendant and in handcuffing the [Djefendant.\n2. Officer Adkins was justified in patting down the [Djefend-ant for his safety under the circumstances. The removal of the screwdriver and wrench from the [Djefendant\u2019s person were the result of the pat-down during an investigative detention based upon a reasonable articulable suspicion.\n3. At the time the [Defendant made the statement^] \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get caught because I was breaking into the business,\u201d the [Defendant had not been arrested and was being detained for investigation. Therefore, the Miranda warnings were not required at that point.\n4. The subsequent statements made by the [Defendant in response to the officer\u2019s questions were made after the administration of the Miranda warnings and were made freely, voluntarily and with knowledge of the [Defendant\u2019s right to remain silent.\n5. The detention of the [Defendant, the seizure of the screwdriver and wrench, and the statements obtained from the [Defendant on February 10th, 2009 did not violate any of the rights of the [Defendant under the Constitution of the United states of America or the Constitution of the State of North Carolina.\n6. The [Defendant's statements made to Officer Adkins and the evidence seized from the [Defendant are admissible at the trial of this action.\nBased upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, it is therefore ordered that the [Defendant's motions to suppress evidence are hereby denied.\nWe hold that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact support its conclusions of law and ruling that Officer Adkins had a reasonable articula-ble suspicion that criminal activity was afoot at the time Officer Adkins detained Defendant. The unchallenged findings of fact show that Officer Adkins was informed after 10:00 p.m. that there had been a report of suspicious activity at Auto America at a time Auto America was closed for business. When Officer Adkins arrived at Auto America he saw Defendant, who generally matched the description of one of the individuals reported, peering from behind a van parked at Auto America. When Defendant spotted Officer Adkins, Defendant ran away from him. Defendant ignored Officer Adkins when he shouted for Defendant to stop, and Officer Adkins ran after Defendant for about an eighth of a mile. When Officer Adkins caught up with Defendant, Defendant was attempting to hide behind a dumpster. When considered together and in context, these facts were suf ficient to raise a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot, and that Defendant was involved. See State v. Butler, 331 N.C. 227, 234, 415 S.E.2d 719, 723 (1992); State v. Willis, 125 N.C. App. 537, 541-42, 481 S.E.2d 407, 410-11 (1997).\nThe United States Supreme Court, in discussing the significance of the flight of a defendant, stated:\nHeadlong flight\u2014wherever it occurs\u2014is the consummate act of evasion: it is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such. In reviewing the propriety of an officer\u2019s conduct, courts do not have available empirical studies dealing with inferences drawn from suspicious behavior, and we cannot reasonably demand scientific certainty from judges or law enforcement officers where none exists. Thus, the determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior.\nIllinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124-25, 145 L. Ed. 2d 570, 576-77 (2000) (citation omitted). The Court further stated:\n\u201c[R]efusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.\u201d But unprovoked flight is simply not a mere refusal to cooperate. Flight, by its very nature, is not \u201cgoing about one\u2019s business\u201d; in fact, it is just the opposite. Allowing officers confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive and investigate further is quite consistent with the individual\u2019s right to go about his business or to stay put and remain silent in the face of police questioning.\nId. at 125, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 577 (citation omitted). In the present case, Defendant\u2019s flight, combined with the totality of the circumstances, was sufficient to support a reasonable articulable suspicion and the investigatory stop. See State v. Jones, 304 N.C. 323, 329, 283 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1981); Willis, 125 N.C. App. at 541-42, 481 S.E.2d at 410-11.\nDefendant argues that the stop was unconstitutional, but does not specifically argue that the pat-down of Defendant incident to the stop was unconstitutional, even if the stop itself was constitutional. We hold that once Officer Adkins felt the screwdriver and wrench during the pat-down, he was justified in removing these items as they constituted both a potential danger to Officer Adkins, and were further suggestive of criminal activity being afoot at Auto America.\nII. Miranda Warnings\nDefendant also contends that his response to Officer Adkins\u2019s questioning while Defendant was on the ground and being restrained with handcuffs should have been suppressed because Officer Adkins had not \u201cmirandized\u201d Defendant at that time. We agree.\n\u201cIt is well established that the standard of review in evaluating a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress is that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact \u2018are conclusive on appeal if supported by competent evidence, even if the evidence is conflicting.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThe determination of whether a defendant was in custody, based on those findings of fact, however, is a question of law and is fully reviewable by this Court.\u201d\nState v. Johnston, 154 N.C. App. 500, 502, 572 S.E.2d 438, 440 (2002) (citations omitted).\nThe concurring opinion confuses Fourth Amendment analysis concerning the permissible scope of an investigatory detention with the appropriate Fifth Amendment analysis required to determine whether Miranda warnings are required. The subjective intent of Officer Adkins is of no consequence in the relevant Fifth Amendment analysis. Nor is the reasonableness of Officer Adkins\u2019s actions in the context of detaining Defendant for investigatory or \u201cTerry stop\u201d purposes.\nThe Miranda Court defined \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602. \u201c[T]he appropriate inquiry in determining whether a defendant is in \u2018custody\u2019 for purposes of Miranda is, based on the totality of the circumstances, whether there was a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u2019 \u201d Buchanan, 353 N.C. at 339, 543 S.E.2d at 828 (citations omitted). The United States Supreme Court has consistently held that \u201cthe initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\u201d Id. at 341, 543 S.E.2d at 829 (quoting Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 323, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994)). \u201cA policeman\u2019s unarticulated plan has no bearing on the question of whether a suspect was \u2018in custody\u2019 at a particular time; the only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood his situation.\u201d Buchanan, 353 N.C. at 341-42, 543 S.E.2d at 829 (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984)).\nJohnston, 154 N.C. App. at 502-03, 572 S.E.2d at 440-41.\nAs [the United States Supreme Court has] repeatedly emphasized, whether a suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d is an objective inquiry. \u201cTwo discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. Once the scene is set and the players\u2019 lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d\nJ.D.B. v. N. Carolina, _ U.S _, _, 180 L. Ed. 2d 310, 322 (2011) (citation omitted).\nOfficer Adkins\u2019s actions in detaining and handcuffing Defendant were reasonable under Fourth Amendment principles. However, Officer Adkins\u2019s questioning of Defendant must be analyzed under Fifth Amendment principles. The only exception carved out of the Miranda rule for custodial interrogation is the public safety exception as recognized in New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1984). Officer Adkins\u2019s asking Defendant why Defendant ran did not implicate Quarles and, therefore, did not constitute the kind of question exempted from the Miranda requirements.\nWe hold that a reasonable person in Defendant\u2019s position, having been forced to the ground by an officer with a taser drawn and in the process of being handcuffed, would have felt his freedom of movement had been restrained to a degree associated with formal arrest. See State v. Crudup, 157 N.C. App. 657, 659-61, 580 S.E.2d 21, 24-25 (2003). The concurring opinion relies on Crudup, but we find that Crudup supports our position. This Court held in Crudup:\nUnder the facts of this case, we conclude, as a matter of law, that defendant was in \u201ccustody.\u201d The record reveals that defendant was immediately handcuffed and detained as a possible burglary suspect. While handcuffed, defendant was questioned while four officers, including Officer Marbrey, surrounded him. Most assuredly, defendant\u2019s freedom of movement was restrained to the degree associated with a formal arrest. A reasonable person under these circumstances would believe that he was under arrest.\nId. at 659-60, 580 S.E.2d at 24 (citations omitted). We do not find that the number of officers involved, or the degree to which the handcuffing of Defendant had been completed, distinguishes the facts in Crudup from those before us.\nWe further hold that Officer Adkins\u2019s questioning of Defendant at that time constituted an interrogation. Id. Therefore, the trial court should have granted Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress Defendant\u2019s statements that he was breaking into Auto America and that he ran from Officer Adkins because he did not want to be caught.\nHowever, we also hold that Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to suppress his statements. The trial court found as fact that, after Defendant was formally arrested and given his Miranda rights, Defendant stated that\nhe had ridden a bus to [Auto America]. . . . [Defendant stated that he had brought tools to the location earlier in the day and had hidden them so that he could use them to break into [Auto America].\nBecause Defendant admitted his guilt after having been given his Miranda rights, we cannot say that the failure to suppress his pre-Miranda statement was prejudicial or harmful. State v. Tuttle, 33 N.C. App. 465, 470, 235 S.E.2d 412, 415 (1977).\nIII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\nDefendant further argues that his attorney was ineffective because his attorney failed to object to the admission of the tools and Defendant\u2019s statements at trial. We disagree.\nHaving determined that the screwdriver and wrench were properly seized pursuant to a constitutional stop and frisk, and that Defendant was not prejudiced by the admission of his pre-Miranda statements, we further hold that Defendant\u2019s counsel was not ineffective when Defendant\u2019s counsel failed to object to the admission of this evidence at trial.\nIV. Resisting an Officer\nFinally, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in not dismissing the charge of misdemeanor resisting an officer because the indictment for this charge was fatally defective. We disagree.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-223 states: \u201cIf any person shall willfully and unlawfully resist, delay or obstruct a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge a duty of his office, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-223 (2011). An indictment charging a violation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-223 must, inter alia, \u201cstate in a general way the manner in which [the] accused resisted or delayed or obstructed such officer.\u201d State v. Fenner, 263 N.C. 694, 700, 140 S.E.2d 349, 353 (1965) (citations omitted). Defendant argues that the indictment in this case failed to state with sufficient particularity the manner in which Defendant resisted, delayed or obstructed Officer Adkins. The indictment at issue stated in relevant part that Defendant resisted Officer Adkins \u201cby not obeying [Officer Adkins\u2019s] command.\u201d\n\u201cAn indictment for resisting arrest must only include a general description of the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d State v. Baldwin, 59 N.C. App. 430, 434, 297 S.E.2d 188, 191 (1982) (citation omitted). In Baldwin, the indictment charged\nthat [the] defendant \u201cunlawfully and wilfully did resist, delay and obstruct [the officer] ... by struggling with [the officer] and attempting to get free of [the officer\u2019s] grasp.\u201d This indictment was notice to the defendant that he should expect the facts surrounding the arrest to be brought out at trial, including his abusive language.\nId. at 435, 297 S.E.2d at 191-92; see also State v. Lynch, 94 N.C. App. 330, 333-34, 380 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1989). Likewise in the present case, the indictment\u2019s general language was sufficient to put Defendant on notice that the events surrounding his arrest would be brought out at trial. The only evidence presented at trial concerning a command given by Officer Adkins was Officer Adkins\u2019s command for Defendant to stop running, which Defendant failed to heed. We hold that the indictment for resisting arrest was not fatally defective.\nNo prejudicial error.\nJudge CALABRIA concurs.\nJudge HUNTER, Robert C., concurs in the result with separate opinion.", "author": "McGEE, Judge.", "type": "majority"}, {"text": "HUNTER, Robert C., Judge,\nconcurring in result.\nI concur with the majority that Defendant is not entitled to a new trial based on a violation of his Miranda rights. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Defendant was in custody at the time Officer Adkins asked Defendant why he was running. Because I conclude Defendant was not in custody, he was not subject to custodial interrogation, and was not entitled to a Miranda warning at the time he stated that he tried \u201cto break[] into the business.\u201d Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress.\nUpon review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, the standard of review is whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are \u201csupported by competent evidence\u201d and, if so, whether the conclusions of law are \u201clegally correct, reflecting a correct application of applicable legal principles to the facts found.\u201d State v. Buchanan, 353 N.C. 332, 336, 543 S.E.2d 823, 826 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). If a defendant does not challenge a trial court\u2019s findings of fact on appeal but \u201cassigns error solely to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion,\u201d as in the present case, this Court\u2019s review is limited to \u201cwhether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact support its conclusions of law and whether those conclusions of law are legally correct.\u201d State v. Stanley, 175 N.C. App. 171, 175, 622 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2005).\nBased on the evidence in the record, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress because: (1) the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law that Defendant was not arrested but only detained for investigation at the time he made the inculpatory statement is supported by the findings of fact and reflects a correct application of our case law; and (2) Defendant was not in custody for purposes of Miranda at the time he made the inculpatory statement.\nBased on Officer Adkins\u2019 testimony at the hearing on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress, the trial court made the following findings of fact:\n6. Officer Adkins pursued [Defendant] approximately one-eighth of a mile to a dumpster located at the adjacent business. [Defendant] was observed trying to hide behind the dumpster.\n7. Officer Adkins subdued [Defendant] on the ground and handcuffed him. While handcuffing [Defendant], Officer Adkins asked [Defendant] why he ran. [Defendant] responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get caught because I was breaking into the business.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, Officer Adkins testified that at the time he caught Defendant, he had his Taser out but put it away once Defendant put his hands up in the air.\nConsequently, the trial court made the following conclusion of law:\n3. At the time [Defendant] made the statement \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get caught because I was breaking into the business,\u201d [Defendant] had not been arrested and was being detained for investigation. Therefore, the Miranda warnings were not required at that point.\nThe first issue that must be addressed is whether Defendant was arrested during the investigatory stop. Our case law recognizes the \u201cexpansion]\u201d of \u201cthe permissible scope of a Terry stop\u201d whereby police officers are authorized to use reasonable means of detaining suspects during an investigative stop without escalating the stop into an arrest. State v. Campbell, 188 N.C. App. 701, 708-09, 656 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Carrouthers, 200 N.C. App. 415, 419, 683 S.E.2d 781, 784 (2009) (Carrouthers I) (noting that police officers are authorized to \u201cengage in conduct and use forms of force\u201d associated with an arrest during an investigatory stop to maintain the status quo or to ensure personal safety without that conduct constituting a de facto arrest (citation and quotation marks omitted)). In Campbell, this Court concluded that the police officers were authorized to handcuff the defendant during an investigatory stop in order to maintain the status quo based on the defendant\u2019s known risk of flight. 188 N.C. App. at 708-09, 656 S.E.2d at 727; see also State v. Carrouthers, _ N.C. App. _, _, 714 S.E.2d 460, 466 (2011) (Carrouthers II) (noting that the officer\u2019s handcuffing of the defendant was a \u201csafety-related detainment,\u201d due to the presence of additional passengers in the defend-dant\u2019s car, and did not escalate the Terry stop into an arrest).\nI agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the investigatory stop of Defendant was valid under the Fourth Amendment based on the totality of the circumstances. Officer Adkins\u2019 decision to handcuff Defendant after catching him was a reasonable means to maintain the status quo and prevent Defendant from trying to flee before Officer Adkins had a chance to investigate further. Additionally, it would have been reasonable to believe another suspect was present because the anonymous caller that reported suspicious activity at the Auto Mart stated that there were two men at that location. Therefore, even though Officer Adkins handcuffed Defendant during the investigatory stop, the handcuffing of Defendant did not escalate the stop into an arrest.\nThe second issue to be determined is whether Defendant was in custody at the time he made the inculpatory statement since custody encompasses not only a formal arrest but also situations where there is a restraint on a defendant\u2019s freedom of movement \u201cof the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d State v. Gaines, 345 N.C. 647, 662, 483 S.E.2d 396, 405 (1997). The majority correctly notes that determination of whether a defendant was in custody for Miranda purposes requires a determination of whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, \u201cthere was a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u2019 \u201d Buchanan, 353 N.C. at 339, 543 S.E.2d at 828 (citation omitted). The majority concludes that because a reasonable person in Defendant\u2019s position would have felt his freedom of movement restrained to a degree associated with an arrest, he was in custody and, thus, entitled to a Miranda warning.\nGenerally, Terry stops are not \u201csubject to the dictates of Miranda.\u201d Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 440, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317, 334 (1984); see also Maryland v. Shatzer, _ U.S. _, _, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1045, 1058 (2010) (noting that \u201cthe temporary and relatively nonthreatening detention involved in a traffic stop or Terry ' stop ... does not constitute Miranda custody\u201d (internal citation omitted)). During a valid investigatory stop, a police officer may \u201cask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer\u2019s suspicions.\u201d Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 439, 82 L. Ed. 2d at 334.\nThe case of United States v. Leshuk, 65 F.3d 1105, (4th Cir. 1995) provides guidance. A hunter found a marijuana cultivation site in a rural area. Id. at 1106. After he reported it to the sheriff\u2019s office, the hunter assisted two deputy sheriffs in locating the defendant. Id. at 1107. The hunter found the defendant, ordered him to put his hands up, and briefly held the defendant by his arm. Id. at 1107, 1110. The deputies asked the defendant a few questions regarding his purpose for being at that location and his identity. Id. at 1107.\nEven though the defendant argued that he was in custody for Miranda purposes because a reasonable person in his position would have believed that he was in custody and not free to leave, the court held that this \u201cobjective belief . . . does not necessarily transform a lawful Terry stop into a custodial interrogation^\u201d Id. at 1109. The court distinguished Terry stops from custodial interrogation as follows: \u201c[i]nstead of being distinguished by the absence of any restriction of liberty, Terry stops differ from custodial interrogation in that they must last no longer than necessary to verify or dispel the officer\u2019s suspicion.\u201d Leshuk, 65 F.3d at 1109. Furthermore, the court noted that it has \u201cconcluded [in other cases] that drawing weapons, handcuffing a suspect, placing a suspect in a patrol car for questioning, or using or threatening to use force does not necessarily elevate a lawful stop into a custodial arrest for Miranda purposes,\u201d and these same principles should apply to determine whether a defendant was in custody. Id. at 1109-10. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that the defendant was not entitled to a Miranda warning because: (1) the \u201cactions of the deputies and the turkey hunter amounted to a limited Terry stop necessary to protect their safety, maintain status quo, and confirm or dispel their suspicions\u201d; (2) their actions were \u201creasonable precautions\u201d; and (3) the questions were reasonably related to the investigatory stop. Id. at 1110; see also United States v. Nunez-Betancourt, 766 F. Supp. 2d 651, 660 (2011) (citing Leshuk and concluding that a brief yet total restriction of the defendant\u2019s liberty was. a valid and reasonable means of protecting the officers\u2019 safety during a Terry stop).\nAs in Leshuk, even though a reasonable person in .Defendant\u2019s position may not have felt free to leave once Officer Adkins placed Defendant in handcuffs, Defendant was not in custody because Officer Adkins\u2019 actions were reasonable means of protecting his personal safety and maintaining the status quo. Furthermore, Defendant\u2019s detention lasted only long enough for the officer to confirm his suspicion that Defendant was engaged in criminal activity.\nThe circumstances surrounding the stop in the present case are distinguishable from cases where o\u00far courts have found a defendant was in custody after a valid investigatory stop. In State v. Washington, the defendant was in custody during an investigatory stop when he was placed in the back seat of the patrol car and questioned by officers. 102 N.C. App 535, 536-38, 402 S.E.2d 851, 852-53 (Greene, J. dissenting), rev\u2019d per curiam for reasons stated in dissent, 330 N.C. 188, 410 S.E.2d 55 (1991). Similarly, in State v. Crudup, 157 N.C. App. 657, 659-60, 580 S.E.2d 21, 24 (2003), we held that the defendant was in custody after an investigatory stop because he was handcuffed and surrounded by four police officers at the time of questioning. In State v. Johnston, 154 N.C. App 500, 503, 572 S.E.2d 438, 441 (2002), we concluded that the defendant was in custody where, after police officers stopped the defendant\u2019s car, the defend-ant was told he was in \u201c \u2018secure custody\u2019 \u201d and \u201cordered out of his vehicle at gun point, handcuffed, placed in the back of a patrol car, and questioned by detectives.\u201d Additionally, in In re L.I., _ N.C. App. _, _, 695 S.E.2d 793, 798 (2010), we concluded that because the defendant was handcuffed and placed in the back of a police officer\u2019s patrol car, he was in custody for Miranda purposes.\nHowever, in all of these cases, the police officers were not detaining the defendants in order to maintain the status quo because all defendants were cooperating with police at the time they were detained. In Washington, Johnston, and In re L.I., the police officers asked the defendants to exit their vehicles and immediately placed them in the back of their police patrol cars even though the defendants did not attempt to flee or give any sign that they would not cooperate. Washington, 102 N.C. App. at 536, 402 S.E.2d at 852; Johnston, 154 N.C. App. at 440, 572 S.E.2d at 501; In re L.I., _ N.C. App. at _, 695 S.E.2d at 796. Similarly, in Crudup, the police responded to the report of a break-in and saw the defendant leaving the location of the alleged crime. 157 N.C. App. at 658, 580 S.E.2d at 23. The officers immediately placed the defendant in handcuffs even though he made no attempt to flee; this Court held the defendant was in custody. Id.\nFurthermore, it was not necessary for the police officers\u2019 personal safety to detain the defendants during the investigatory stops in Washington and Crudup. In Washington, the police officers were not aware of a specific threat to their safety at the time they placed the defendant in the back of the patrol car. 102 N.C. App at 536, 402 S.E.2d at 852. Similarly, in Crudup, the police officers were responding to a call of a possible break-in but had no information to suggest the presence of multiple suspects. 157 N.C. App at 658, 580 S.E.2d at 23.\nConversely, when Officer Adkins handcuffed Defendant, it was a reasonable means of protecting the officer\u2019s personal safety and maintaining the status quo by preventing Defendant from fleeing again. Defendant was detained pursuant to an investigatory stop and was not in custody. Therefore, I would hold that Defendant was not entitled to a Miranda warning at the time he made the inculpatory statement. To hold otherwise would require Miranda warnings anytime an officer needed to restrain a suspect during an investigatory stop in order to maintain the status quo or protect his or her safety. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress.\n. Although Defendant made multiple inculpatory statements, my use of \u201cthe inculpatory statement\u201d refers to the statement made by Defendant before he was given a Miranda warning: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get caught because I was breaking into the business.\u201d\n. The court noted that it included the actions of the hunter in its analysis since a reasonable person would have believed that the hunter was a law enforcement officer.

Constitutional Law\u2014separation of powers\u2014prosecutor\u2019s voluntary dismissal and refiling of charge\u2014control of calendar\nThe separation of powers provision of the North Carolina Constitution was not violated by the State dismissing an impaired driving charge when its motion for a continuance was denied. Although defendant contended that the district attorney is an executive branch officer, the prosecutor is by precedent a judicial or quasi-judicial officer. Even if the district attorney is an executive officer, the trial court retained ultimate control over its calendar after the State filed a new charge.\n2. Constitutional Law\u2014due process\u2014voluntary dismissal of charge after continuance denied\u2014refiling\u2014no violation\nDefendant was not denied due process when the State refiled an impaired driving charge which it had earlier dismissed after its motion for a continuance had been denied. The voluntary dismissal was pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931, the refiling was within the statute of limitations, defendant did not argue bad faith or show how he was prejudiced, and defendant did not demonstrate how the charge shocked the conscience or interfered with defendant\u2019s fundamental rights.\n3. Constitutional Law\u2014right to speedy trial\u2014charge dismissed and refiled\u2014appealed from district to superior court\nDefendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial on an impaired driving charge was not violated where the date of the offense and initial charge was 7 March 2009, that charge was voluntarily dismissed by the State and the charge was refiled in district court on 13 April, defendant never filed a speedy trial motion in district court, and his only speedy trial request was in superior court on 4 February 2010. The time from his appeal from district to superior court until his trial in superior court was less than one year. Moreover, the reasons for the delay were attributable to defendant as much as to the State, defendant\u2019s delayed assertion of the right to a speedy trial weighed against him, and defendant did not show actual impairment of his defense.\n4. Pleadings\u2014summons\u2014date of offense\u2014sufficient\nDefendant had adequate notice of a charge of impaired driving even though defendant argued that the criminal summons was defective in that it did not state the exact hour and minute of the offense.

Mekeel, for the State.\nReece & Reece, by Michael J. Reece for defendant-appellant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STEELMAN, Judge.\nThe State\u2019s dismissal and re-filing of the impaired driving charge did not violate the separation of powers. This same conduct did not violate defendant\u2019s rights to due process or a speedy trial. The criminal summons was not fatally defective.\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\nOn 7 March 2006, defendant was charged with driving while impaired in Pitt County. The case was scheduled for hearing in District Court 11 times. Several continuances were based on the unavailability of the State witnesses. On 18 July 2007, the arresting officer was not present in court. When the District Court denied the State\u2019s motion for a continuance, the State voluntarily dismissed the charge. On 27 July 2007, the State filed a new driving while impaired charge arising out of the 7 March 2006 incident. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by District Court Judge Charles M. Vincent on 24 October 2007. On 26 October 2007, the State appealed this ruling to Superior Court. On 28 February 2008, Judge Thomas D. Haigwood remanded this matter to the District Court for entry of a written order containing findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nOn 4 April 2008, in compliance with Judge Haigwood\u2019s order, Judge Vincent entered a written order which again dismissed the charge against defendant. On 9 May 2008, Judge W. Russell Duke, Jr. entered an order in Superior Court, reversing Judge Vincent\u2019s order and remanding the case to the District Court for trial. Defendant\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to review this order was denied by this Court on 1 August 2008. On 13 April 2009, defendant was convicted of driving while impaired in District Court. Defendant appealed to Superior Court. On 15 February 2010, Judge Clifton W. Everett denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, which was filed 4 February 2010. Judge Everett ruled that defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not violated because \u201cthis is a misdemeanor charge and carries a statute of limitations\u201d which has now expired.\nOn 17 February 2010, a jury found defendant guilty of driving while impaired. Judge Everett found defendant to be a Level Two offender, and imposed a suspended sentence of twelve months, with 24 months of supervised probation, 30 days in jail, a fine of $500, and substance abuse treatment.\nDefendant appeals.\nII. Whether State\u2019s Dismissal Violated the Separation of Powers Provision of the North Carolina Constitution\nIn his first argument, defendant contends that the State\u2019s dismissal of his original charge on 18 July 2007, following the District Court\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s motion for a continuance, violated the separation of powers provision of the North Carolina Constitution. Defendant further contends that Judge Duke erred in not dismissing the charge filed on 27 July 2007. We disagree.\nDefendant argues that the district attorney is an executive branch official who was obligated to proceed with the trial when the District Court denied the State\u2019s continuance motion on 18 July 2007. Defendant further contends that' to allow the State to voluntarily dismiss the charge allowed the executive branch to subvert the courts\u2019 ultimate authority to manage its trial calendar.\nWe first note that defendant\u2019s assertion that the district attorney is an executive branch officer is highly questionable. The Supreme Court addressed this question in the seminal case of Simeon v. Hardin, 339 N.C. 358, 451 S.E.2d 858 (1994):\nFirst of all, the district attorney cannot be easily categorized as belonging to any one branch of government. We note that the office of the district attorney is created in Article IV of the Constitution, the Judicial article, rather than in Article III, the Executive article. Furthermore, in the past, this Court has characterized district attorneys as \u201cindependent constitutional officers.\u201d State v. Camacho, 329 N.C. 589, 593, 406 S.E.2d 868, 870 (1991). We have also recognized that solicitors, as district attorneys were formerly known, are officers of the court and, in varied factual situations and in relation to diverse legal problems, may be considered a judicial or quasi-judicial officer.\nId. at 375, 451 S.E.2d at 870. Thus, defendant\u2019s separation of powers argument must fail since the district attorney is a judicial or quasi-judicial officer.\nEven assuming that the district attorney is an executive officer, no violation of the separation of powers exists in this case. Our Supreme Court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-931, which allows the district attorney to dismiss charges, is facially constitutional. Id. at 375-77, 451 S.E.2d at 869-71. Separation of powers does not demand that the branches of government \u201cmust be kept wholly and entirely separate and distinct[.]\u201d State v. Furmage, 250 N.C. 616, 626, 109 S.E.2d 563, 570 (1959) (quoting 2 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 524 (1833)).\nThe State complied with N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-931 when the State voluntarily dismissed the original charge after the District Court denied its motion for a continuance. After the State filed a new charge, the Superior Court reversed the dismissal of that charge and remanded the case for trial. The trial court retained ultimate control over its calendar. Neither the dismissal nor the filing of the new charge threatened to violate the separation of powers. Therefore, even assuming two branches of government are at work in the setting of the trial calendar, defendant\u2019s separation of powers claim fails.\nThis argument is without merit.\nHI. Whether the State\u2019s Filing of a New Charge Against Defendant Violated Defendant\u2019s Rights to Due Process and a Sneedv Trial\nIn his second and third arguments, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss, since the charge violated his due process and speedy trial rights. We disagree.\nA. Due Process\nDefendant argues that \u201cthe conduct of the State in re-filing the charge that had previously been dismissed both shocks the conscience and interferes with the rights and liberties of the citizenry. A criminal defendant has no power to control his prosecution.\u201d Defendant further argues that the imbalance of power between defendant and the State can be remedied only \u201cby the inherent authority of the trial court[.]\u201d\nThe North Carolina Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the law of the land.\u201d N.C. Const. art. I, \u00a7 19. The Law of the Land Clause was \u201ccopied in substance from Magna Charta by the framers of the [North Carolina] Constitution of 1776\u201d and is synonymous with \u201cdue process of law, a phrase appearing in the Federal Constitution and the organic law of many states.\u201d State v. Ballance, 229 N.C. 764, 768-69, 51 S.E.2d 731, 734 (1949) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., 358 N.C. 160, 180, 594 S.E.2d 1, 15 (2004).\n\u201cSubstantive due process protection prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the conscience or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d State v. Thompson, 349 N.C. 483, 491, 508 S.E.2d 277, 282 (1998) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution. \u201c[E]very person for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person, or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law; and right and justice shall be administered without favor, denial, or delay.\u201d N.C. Const. art. I, \u00a7 18. The right to a speedy trial is also guaranteed by the 6th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nIn the instant case, the State filed the new charge on 27 July 2007, after voluntarily dismissing the original charge pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-931. The North Carolina Supreme Court held that N.C. Gen. Stat \u00a7 15A-931 did not violate due process. Simeon, 339 N.C. at 376-77, 451 S.E.2d at 870-71. Moreover, subsection (b) of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-931 provides that dismissal of a charge does not toll the statute of limitations. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-931(b) (2011). The statute of limitations for misdemeanors is two years from the commission of the offense. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15-1 (2011). In the instant case, the statute of limitations would have expired on 7 March 2008.\nDefendant fails to demonstrate how the new charge shocked the conscience or interfered with defendant\u2019s fundamental rights. Defendant does not argue that the State\u2019s action was taken in bad faith, nor does he indicate how he was prejudiced by the new charge. This argument is without merit.\nB. Speedy Trial\nDefendant contends that the \u201clength of delay in defendant\u2019s case ran from 7 March 2007, the offense date,\u201d until his conviction in Superior Court on 17 February 2010. Defendant was convicted in District Court and appealed to Superior Court on 13 April 2009. On 4 February 2010, defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial.\nIn determining whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been infringed, our Courts consider the four factors enumerated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530-32, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101, 116-18 (1972): (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to a speedy trial, and (4) prejudice to defendant. State v. Washington, 192 N.C. App. 277, 282, 665 S.E.2d 799, 803 (2008).\nWe must first determine the relevant period of delay. \u201cA defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial attaches upon being formally accused of criminal activity, by arrest or indictment.\u201d State v. Hammonds, 141 N.C. App. 152, 159, 541 S.E.2d 166, 172 (2000). The period relevant to speedy trial analysis ends upon trial. See id. at 160, 541 S.E.2d at 173. If the length of delay approaches one year, we examine the remaining three factors in Barker. See State v. Webster, 337 N.C. 674, 678-79, 447 S.E.2d 349, 351 (1994).\nIn the instant case, the date of the offense and the initial charge was 7 March 2006. Defendant was tried upon the re-filed charge in District Court on 13 April 2009. However, defendant never filed a motion for a speedy trial in District Court. His only speedy trial request was filed in Superior Court on 4 February 2010. Under these circumstances, where defendant already had a trial in District Court, the time for computing the delay runs from his appeal from District Court to Superior Court (13 April 2009) until his trial in Superior Court (15 February 2010). The period of delay was thus less than one year, and the remainder of the Barker analysis is inapplicable. We hold defendant\u2019s claim of denial of the right to a speedy trial to be without merit.\nEven assuming arguendo that the delay exceeded one year, defendant\u2019s speedy trial claim is without merit. Under the second Barker factor, the reason for the delay, defendant argues that the failure of State witnesses to appear in court and the State\u2019s filing of a new charge were responsible for the delay. Defendant bears the burden of \u201cpresenting prima facie evidence that the delay was caused by the neglect or willfulness\u201d of the State. Washington, 192 N.C. App. at 283, 665 S.E.2d at 804.\nIn reviewing the reasons for delay, it appears that of the 11 continuances of the original charge, six were for defendant, three were for the State, and two were by consent. After the charges were re-filed on 27 July 2007, the case bounced back and forth between District Court and Superior Court as Judge Vincent\u2019s ruling dismissing the case was appealed. On 13 January 2009, the District Court Judge recused himself, and the case was finally tried in District Court on 13 April 2009. Once in Superior Court, defendant\u2019s case was tried in less than one year.\nWe hold that the reasons for delay were attributable as much to defendant as to the State. In addition, the delay due to the State\u2019s appeal of Judge Vincent\u2019s order and the recusal of a District Court judge are neutral factors, weighing neither in favor nor against defendant\u2019s speedy trial motion. See Hammonds, 141 N.C. App. at 161, 541 S.E.2d at 174. These delays were not caused by the negligence or willfulness of the State. We hold that this factor cannot be weighed in favor of defendant\u2019s claim.\nAs to the third Barker factor, the record is unequivocal that defendant did not assert his right to a speedy trial until 4 February 2010. \u201cDefendant\u2019s failure to assert his right to a speedy trial, or his failure to assert his right sooner in the process, does not foreclose his speedy trial claim, but does weigh against his contention[.]\u201d State v. Grooms, 353 N.C. 50, 63, 540 S.E.2d 713, 722 (2000). In Grooms, the defendant\u2019s assertion came nearly three years after indictment, and the Court held that the delay in his demand weighed against his claim. Id. In this portion of our analysis, we presume that the delay is computed from the filing of the initial charge, 7 March 2006. Thus, defendant\u2019s demand for a speedy trial came almost four years later, on 4 February 2010, and almost a year after his conviction in District Court. This delay in the assertion of his right to a speedy trial weighs against defendant\u2019s claim.\nFinally, as to the fourth Barker factor, defendant argues that he suffered prejudice in the impairment of his defense. \u201cThe right to a speedy trial is designed: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\u201d Webster, 337 N.C. at 680-81, 447 S.E.2d at 352. In the instant case, defendant fails to articulate any specific evidence or witness of which he has been deprived because of the delay.\nDefendant further argues he suffered \u201canxiety and concern\u201d during the delay. He attributes this anxiety to the fact that the prosecutor was \u201cfree to re-file at any time within the two year statute of limitations for misdemeanors[.]\u201d The State filed a new charge 9 days after the original charge was dismissed, well within the two year statute of limitations for misdemeanors. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15-1 (2011). In Webster, the Court held that anxiety does not \u201cloom as large as actual impairment of the defendant\u2019s ability to defend against the criminal charges themselves.\u201d Webster, 337 N.C. at 681, 447 S.E.2d at 352. Defendant did not assert his right to a speedy trial until almost two years after the statute of limitations had expired. As defendant\u2019s anxiety was limited by the statute of limitations and defendant failed to show actual impairment of his defense, the fourth factor weighs against defendant\u2019s claim.\nThe four Barker factors must be balanced. \u201cNo single factor is regarded as either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right to a speedy trial.\u201d State v. McBride, 187 N.C. App. 496, 498, 653 S.E.2d 218, 220 (2007). See also Barker, 407 U.S. at 529-30, 33 L. Ed. 2d at 116-17. Although the presumed length of the delay required further analysis under Barker, the reason for delay does not weigh in defendant\u2019s favor. Defendant\u2019s tardy assertion of his right and lack of impairment to his defense weigh against his claim. We hold that even if the period of delay is computed from the date of the original charge, defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not violated.\nThis argument is without merit.\nIV. Whether the Criminal Summons was Fatally Defective\nIn his final argument, defendant contends that the criminal summons, issued on 27 July 2007, was defective in that it failed to state the time of offense in terms of the exact hour and minute. We disagree.\n\u201cAn indictment or criminal charge is constitutionally sufficient if it apprises the defendant of the charge against him with enough certainty to enable him to prepare his defense and to protect him from subsequent prosecution for the same offense.\u201d State v. Coker, 312 N.C. 432, 434, 323 S.E.2d 343, 346 (1984).\n\u201cThe legislature has, within constitutionally mandated parameters, the power to prescribe the manner in which a criminal charge can be stated in a pleading to relieve the State of the common law requirement that every element of the offense be charged.\u201d Id. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-138.1(c) states that a pleading is \u201csufficient if it states the time and place of the alleged offense in the usual form[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-138.1(c) (2011) (emphasis added). Defendant fails to cite any authority that \u201cin the usual form\u201d demands that the hour and minute of the offense be alleged in the charging instrument.\nIn Coker, the Court refused to quash an indictment that charged the defendant with \u201coperating\u201d a vehicle, instead of \u201cdriving,\u201d as prescribed in the pleading subsection of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-138.1. \u201cIn any event \u2018operate\u2019 as used in defendant\u2019s citation is not so great a refinement on the statutory short-form pleading as to render the charge unintelligible or to prevent the court from proceeding to judgment.\u201d Coker, 312 N.C. at 436, 323 S.E.2d at 347. The Court also rejected an argument that the indictment was \u201cconstitutionally infirm\u201d because it lacked a statement of the theory of impairment. Id. at 436-41, 323 S.E2d at 347-50. The Court pointed out that a defendant who feels he may be surprised may request a bill of particulars. Id. at 437, 323 S.E.2d at 348.\nIn the instant case, the summons identified the charge as \u201coperate a motor vehicle on a street or highway while subject to an impairing substance\u201d and the date of the alleged offense as 7 March 2006. We hold that the date of the offense is a sufficient allegation of time in the usual form.\nDefendant does not show prejudice resulting from the lack of the hour and minute of the offense on the summons. Defendant does not argue that he was surprised, or that he sought to rely on an alibi defense. Defendant does not assert that the summons exposed him to a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. When the State filed a charge on 27 July 2007, the summons stated the same offense, same offense date, same complainant, same location, same defendant, and same driver\u2019s license number as the previous citation. The record does not indicate that defendant faced another charge of driving while impaired on 7 March 2006. Defendant did not request a bill of particulars. See State v. Eason, 242 N.C. 59, 62, 86 S.E.2d 774, 777 (1955).\nThis argument is without merit.\nV. Conclusion\nUnder the holding of our Supreme Court in Simeon, there was no violation of separation of powers. Defendant failed to demonstrate that the dismissal of the driving while impaired charge and subsequent re-filing violated his due process rights. The length of the delay did not trigger consideration of the remaining Barker factors. Defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not violated. Defendant had adequate notice of the charge, and has failed to show prejudice; therefore, the criminal summons was not fatally defective.\nNO ERROR.\nJudges GEER and BEASLEY concur.\n. We note that although parts of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-138.1 were amended in 2006, subsection (c) was unchanged.", "author": "STEELMAN, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v. JOHN BRAVER FRIEND"]}}}

Davan, for defendant-appellant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "HUNTER, Robert C., Judge.\nThe North Carolina Department of Correction (the \u201cDOC\u201d) appeals from the 25 February 2011 opinion and award of the Full Commission of the North Carolina Industrial Commission. In that opinion and award, the Full Commission affirmed an award by the Deputy Commissioner of temporary total disability compensation to Timothy Rose (\u201cplaintiff\u2019). The DOC alleges that plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between a compensable injury and the back pain for which he seeks compensation. Consequently, the DOC alleges the Full Commission erred in affirming the Award and Opinion of the Deputy Commissioner because: (1) the Full Commission\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by competent evidence, and (2) the Full Commission\u2019s conclusions of law are contrary to North Carolina caselaw. After careful review, we affirm the opinion and award of the Industrial Commission.\nBackground\nPlaintiff began working for the DOC in 2007 and was employed as a correctional officer at the time he sustained an injury at work on 3 February 2008. On that date, plaintiff fell forward while walking up the stairs and struck his right knee on one of the stairs. That same day, plaintiff filed an Employee Initial Report of Injury reporting an injury to his right knee. The night of his fall, plaintiff was treated for pain in his right knee. Plaintiff later testified that upon striking his knee he felt an immediate sensation of pain \u201cthat went from [his] butt cheek down\u2014all the way down to [his] foot.\u201d\nPlaintiff received treatment at the local hospital over the next month and began seeking treatment from Dr. George Miller, a board certified orthopedic surgeon, in March 2008. On 27 March 2008, plaintiff reported pain in his right foot, left leg, and back pain. An MRI scan showed plaintiff had a disc protrusion that was pressing on the right L5 nerve in his spine. Dr. Miller referred plaintiff to Dr. Kurt Voos (\u201cDr. Voos\u201d), also a board certified orthopedic surgeon.\nDr. Voos performed back surgery on plaintiff on 5 June 2008. However, plaintiff continued to have lower back and leg pain and has required continued narcotic medication. Dr. Voos determined plaintiff had reached maximum medical improvement with 10% permanent partial disability for his back.\nOn 29 April 2008, plaintiff\u2019s employer denied compensation for plaintiff\u2019s lower back condition. Plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was heard on 9 March 2009. Deputy Commissioner Ledford filed an opinion and award on 29 July 2010 concluding plaintiff was entitled to benefits for injuries to his lower back and his right knee. The DOC appealed to the Full Commission, which, on 25 February 2011, affirmed the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision finding, inter alia, that: plaintiff\u2019s 3 February 2008 accident\nwas a significant contributing or causative factor in plaintiff\u2019s development of a disc bulge at L4-L5-The Full Commission finds by the greater weight of the medical evidence, that plaintiff\u2019s back pain did not develop immediately at the time of the fall and that fact does not negate the casual connection to the accident.\nPlaintiff was awarded temporary total disability of $355.52 per week from 27 March 2008 until further order of the Industrial Commission as well as medical expenses resulting from the injuries. The DOC appeals from the decision of the Full Commission.\nOur review of an opinion and award of the Industrial Commission \u201cis limited to consideration of whether competent evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings of fact and whether the findings support the Commission\u2019s conclusions of law. This \u2018[C]ourt\u2019s duty goes no further than to determine whether the record contains any evidence tending to support the finding.\u2019 \u201d Richardson v. Maxim Healthcare/Allegis Grp., 362 N.C. 657, 660, 669 S.E.2d 582, 584 (2008) (internal citation omitted) (quoting Anderson v. Lincoln Const. Co., 265 N.C. 431, 434, 144 S.E.2d 272, 274 (1965)).\nDiscussion\nThe thrust of the DOC\u2019s first argument is that a back injury is not a compensable injury if the symptoms of the injury developed gradually over a period of time. We disagree.\nIn support of its argument, the DOC relies on Chambers v. Transit Mgmt., 360 N.C. 609, 618, 636 S.E.2d 553, 558 (2006). In Chambers, the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded the evidence in that case was insufficient to establish the plaintiff suffered a \u201cspecific traumatic incident\u201d as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 97-2(6). Section 97-2(6) defines an \u201cinjury\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, in pertinent part:\nWith respect to back injuries, however, where injury to the back arises out of and in the course of the employment and is the direct result of a specific traumatic incident of the work assigned, \u201cinjury by accident\u201d shall be construed to include any disabling physical injury to the back arising out of and causally related to such incident.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 97-2(6) (2009) (emphasis added). The Chambers Court noted prior caselaw established that a \u201cspecific traumatic incident\u201d under section 97-2(6) \u201cmeans the \u2018injury must not have developed gradually but must have occurred at a cognizable time.\u2019 \u201d Chambers, 360 N.C. at 618, 636 S.E.2d at 558 (emphasis added) (quoting Bradley v. E.B. Sportswear, Inc., 77 N.C. App. 450, 452, 335 S.E.2d 52, 53 (1985)).\nIn light of Chambers, the DOC argues plaintiffs back condition is not compensable because plaintiffs evidence establishes he did not report back pain until approximately six weeks after his fall. The DOC\u2019s argument, however, incorrectly applies our Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Chambers.\nThe distinguishing factor of Chambers is that the plaintiff was seeking compensation for an injury that was the result of \u201c \u2018no particular inciting event.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 617, 636 S.E.2d at 558. The plaintiff \u201cpresented no evidence linking [his] pain to the occurrence of an injury.\u201d Id. at 618, 636 S.E.2d at 559. Thus, the Chambers Court concluded the plaintiff failed to establish the injury was \u201c \u2018the direct result of a specific traumatic incident\u2019 and \u2018causally related to such incident.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 619, 636 S.E.2d at 559 (quoting N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 97-2(6) (2005)).\nThe DOC appears to base its reliance on Chambers on the fact that the plaintiff in that case described a \u201c \u2018gradual onset\u2019 \u201d of pain. Id. at 617, 636 S.E.2d at 558. The Chambers Court recognized, however, that a compensable \u201c \u2018injury must not have developed gradually.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 618, 636 S.E.2d at 558 (citation omitted and emphasis added). The Court did not conclude that the gradual onset of pain would be determinative of the compensability of a claim, noting that pain \u201cas a general rule, [is] the result of a \u2018specific traumatic incident.\u2019 \u201d Chambers, 360 N.C. at 619, 636 S.E.2d at 559 (quoting Roach v. Lupoli Constr. Co., 88 N.C. App. 271, 273, 362 S.E.2d 823, 824 (1987)). Rather, the Chambers Court concluded that the gradual onset of the plaintiff\u2019s pain \u201cwithout more, does not establish evidence of a specific traumatic incident.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\nHere, it is undisputed that plaintiff fell and suffered an injury to his knee while at work. Chambers, therefore, does not, as a matter of law, require the conclusion that plaintiff failed to establish a \u201cspecific traumatic incident\u201d as the DOC contends. As this Court stated in Roach:\nJust because [the plaintiff] felt pain for the first time hours after the time he alleges he injured himself, does not mean that the \u201cspecific traumatic incident\u201d could not have occurred when he says it did. Logic dictates that injury and pain do not have to occur simultaneously for [the plaintiff] to establish that he sustained a compensable injury ....\n88 N.C. App. at 273, 362 S.E.2d at 825. The DOC\u2019s argument is overruled.\nThe remaining issue raised by the DOC is whether the record contains competent evidence to support the Full Commission\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s 3 February 2008 fall was a \u201ccontributing or causative factor\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s back injury. We conclude it does.\nIt is the plaintiff that bears the burden of establishing a causal connection between his injury and an accident arising out of and suffered in the course of employment. Gray v. RDU Airport Auth., _ N.C. App. _, _, 692 S.E.2d 170, 174 (2010). The DOC argues plaintiff has failed to meet his burden because the testimony of his medical expert as to the cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury was no more than a guess or mere speculation.\nIn cases of \u201ccomplicated medical questions far removed from the ordinary experience and knowledge of laymen, only an expert can give competent opinion evidence as to the cause of the injury.\u201d Holley v. ACTS, Inc., 357 N.C. 228, 232, 581 S.E.2d 750, 753 (2003). The evidence upon which a medical expert bases his or her opinion as to causation \u201cmust be such as to take the case out of the realm of conjecture and remote possibility.\u201d Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted). The entirety of the evidence must establish a \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d as to causation. Id. at 234, 581 S.E.2d at 754.\nHere, plaintiff\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Voos, testified in his deposition as follows:\n[Counsel]: Well, more likely than not to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, can you relate all of the problems that [plaintiff] had based on all the different scenarios that we\u2019ve talked about today back to the February 3 incident?\n[Dr. Voos]: I won\u2019t speak to the knee. I don\u2019t know if he ever had anything done with the knee pain per say but I would say for his back yes. (Emphasis added.)\nThus, the record establishes that plaintiff\u2019s medical expert concluded to a \u201creasonable degree of medial certainty\u201d that plaintiff\u2019s fall on 3 February 2008 was the cause of his lower back pain. The DOC\u2019s argument is overruled.\nIn summary, the record contains competent evidence to support the Full Commission\u2019s findings of fact and justifies its conclusions of law. The opinion and award of the Industrial Commission is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nJudges GEER and HUNTER, Jr., concur.", "author": "HUNTER, Robert C., Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["TIMOTHY ROSE, Employee, Plaintiff v.

Gerald Beaver, for Defendant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STEPHENS, Judge.\nOn 12 October 2009, Defendant Denae Jiton Blocker was indicted bn 11 charges related to a hotel robbery. Blocker pled guilty to the consolidated charges pursuant to North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), in Cumberland County Superior Court, the Honorable Gregory A. Weeks presiding. Following entry of her plea, but prior to sentencing, Blocker filed, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-980, a \u201cMotion to Suppress Prior Conviction for Sentencing Purposes,\u201d seeking suppression of a 2007 conviction that Blocker alleged was obtained in violation of her right to counsel. The trial court briefly heard arguments of counsel before denying Blocker\u2019s motion. Following presentation of evidence at the sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced Blocker to 61 to 83 months imprisonment. Blocker appeals.\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying Blocker\u2019s motion to suppress the use of her 2007 conviction in sentencing her on the 2009 charges. Blocker argues that she was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on her motion and that the trial court\u2019s summary denial of her motion was erroneous. We agree.\nIn denying Blocker\u2019s motion, the trial court agreed with the State\u2019s contention that Blocker\u2019s motion, which alleged that she was indigent and did not knowingly and voluntarily waive counsel when she pled guilty to the 2007 conviction, was an impermissible Boykin-style \u201ccollateral attack\u201d on Blocker\u2019s 2007 conviction and that the motion \u201cwas a matter that . . . should have been raised by way of [a motion for appropriate relief] at the District Court level\u201d where Blocker was previously convicted. However, as noted in a prior unpublished opinion by this Court, while a Boykin challenge cannot be used to collaterally attack a prior conviction, a defendant may contest, pursuant to section 15A-980, a trial court\u2019s use of that prior conviction at a sentencing hearing. State v. Fulp, No. COA97-1305 (N.C. App. Dec. 15, 1998). In that case, the defendant moved to suppress a prior conviction on the grounds that the defendant did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel, and the trial court summarily denied the motion, concluding that it constituted an improper collateral attack on the prior conviction pursuant to Boykin. Id., slip op. at 2. On appeal in Fulp, we held that the trial court erred in summarily denying the motion because the defendant did not seek to overturn, or collaterally attack, his prior conviction pursuant to Boykin, but rather sought to suppress the use of that conviction for sentencing. Id., slip op. at 3. We, therefore, remanded the case to the trial court for a proper determination of the defendant\u2019s motion. Id. While we recognize that this prior unpublished decision is not binding, United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Simpson, 126 N.C. App. 393, 396, 485 S.E.2d 337, 339, disc. review denied, 347 N.C. 141, 492 S.E.2d 37 (1997), we find the reasoning persuasive. We further note that, on appeal after remand, both this Court and our Supreme Court addressed the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion following an evidentiary hearing, specifically the propriety of the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the voluntary and knowing nature of the defendant\u2019s waiver of representation at his prior conviction. See State v. Fulp, 355 N.C. 171, 558 S.E.2d 156, (2002); State v. Fulp, 144 N.C. App. 428, 548 S.E.2d 785 (2001). The implication from those rulings, which are binding on this Court, is that a motion to suppress a prior conviction that challenges the voluntary nature of a waiver of counsel for that prior conviction may properly be made before the sentencing judge for a subsequent conviction.\nIn this case, Blocker\u2019s motion and supporting affidavit raised factual issues regarding her alleged indigence and waiver of counsel, but the trial court summarily denied the motion on grounds that it constituted an impermissible collateral attack. That ruling by the trial court was erroneous. Although Blocker could not seek to overturn her prior conviction pursuant to Boykin, section 15A-980 grants Blocker the right to move to suppress that conviction\u2019s use in this case. The trial court\u2019s decision to summarily deny that motion to suppress as a collateral attack was an abuse of discretion. See State v. Harvey, 78 N.C. App. 235, 237, 336 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1985) (stating that the trial court\u2019s decision to summarily deny a motion to suppress that fails to set forth adequate legal grounds is vested in the sound discretion of the trial court). Accordingly, we vacate the action of the trial court and remand the case for proper determination of Blocker\u2019s motion.\nVACATED and REMANDED.\nJudges STROUD and BEASLEY concur.\n. Section 15A-980 provides that \u201c[a] defendant has the right to suppress the use of a prior conviction that was obtained in violation of his right to counsel if its use by the State [will] . .. [r]esult in a lengthened sentence of imprisonment.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-980(a) (2011).\n. Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 23 L.

E.g., State v. Ford, 281 N.C. 62, 65, 187 S.E.2d 741, 743 (1972). In State v. Stafford, 114 N.C. App. 101, 440 S.E.2d 410 (1994), this Court held that a challenge to a prior conviction pursuant to Boykin could not be made collaterally, but must be brought in the case in which the original conviction was obtained.", "author": "STEPHENS, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Herzog for Defendant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STEPHENS, Judge.\nDefendant Jaquan Rasean Weathers appeals from judgments entered upon his convictions for the first-degree murder of Leroy Hodge, Jr. (known as \u201cRico\u201d) and three related counts of kidnapping. The evidence at trial pertinent to the issues on appeal tended to show the following: The victim\u2019s house was commonly the site of illegal drug sales and use, particularly crack cocaine. On the night of the murder, Johnny Wilson had been selling crack from the victim\u2019s home before leaving to visit a friend. When Wilson returned, he entered the apartment and saw Defendant waving a gun around. Defendant was upset and angry because he believed someone had taken his drugs. As Wilson stood in the kitchen, he heard a gunshot from the bedroom. When Wilson entered the bedroom, he saw Rico lying on the floor and Defendant standing with his back to the wall.\nWilson was one of the State\u2019s chief witnesses at trial. During his direct examination on 28 February 2011, Wilson was shaking while testifying about Defendant\u2019s involvement in the murder. When he returned to the stand on 2 March, he \u201cbegan to testify, but within a few minutes became distraught and indicated he did not wish to make any other statements.\u201d Wilson was shaking more noticeably than he had been on 28 February, and laid his head down on top of the witness stand and began to cry. Wilson became even more upset when a young man dressed in street clothes entered the courtroom. When asked if he had been threatened, Wilson responded, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to answer that question.\u201d\nIn light of Wilson\u2019s extreme emotional state, the trial court excused Wilson from testifying further. At the prosecution\u2019s request, the court called a hearing on the issue of whether the doctrine of forfeiture applied to the circumstances and whether Wilson\u2019s testimony would remain on the record. Defendant argued that the appropriate remedy was to declare a mistrial because he had been denied the right to confront Wilson. By order entered 11 March 2011, the court directed that Wilson\u2019s testimony remain on the record. In the order, the trial court found that Defendant had \u201ccommitted wrongful acts that were undertaken with the intention of preventing potential witnesses from testifying and has in fact caused a potential witness, Johnny Wilson, to refuse to testify.\u201d\nDiscussion\nDefendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. Defendant contends that his actions toward Wilson were not designed to prevent Wilson from testifying and, in any event, were not egregious enough to trigger forfeiture of his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. We disagree.\nIn considering whether the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial, this Court employs an abuse of discretion standard.\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and is entitled to great deference since the trial court is in a far better position than an appellate court to determine the effect of any misconduct on the jury. Absent an abuse of discretion, therefore, the trial court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal. An abuse of discretion occurs when a ruling is manifestly unsupported by reason, which is to say it is so arbitrary that it could not have been the result of a reasoned decision.\nState v. Taylor, 362 N.C. 514, 538, 669 S.E.2d 239, 260 (2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted).\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. However, certain wrongful actions by an accused can result in forfeiture of his Confrontation Clause rights. See Giles v. California, 554 U.S. 353, 359, 171 L. Ed. 2d 488, 495 (2008). Under the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing, \u201cone who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation.\u201d Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 833, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, 244 (2006). \u201cThe rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing ... extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds[.]\u201d Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 62, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177, 199 (2004). Thus,\nwhen defendants seek to undermine the judicial process by procuring or coercing silence from witnesses and victims, the \u2022Sixth Amendment does not require courts to acquiesce. While defendants have no duty to assist the State in proving their guilt, they do have the duty to refrain from acting in ways that destroy the integrity of the criminal trial system.\nDavis, 547 U.S. at 833, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 244.\nAs codified in Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6), forfeiture occurs when the defendant has \u201c \u2018engaged or acquiesced in wrongdo ing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.\u2019 \u201d Giles, 554 U.S. at 367, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 500 (quoting Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(6)). The intent requirement \u201cmeans that the [doctrine] applies only if the defendant has in mind the particular purpose of making the witness unavailable.\u201d Id.\nThe North Carolina Rules of Evidence have no similar provision, and the doctrine of forfeiture has not been addressed directly in our State\u2019s case law. Here, the trial court followed the approach adopted by Utah state courts in Utah v. Poole which, as in federal case law, focused on the defendant\u2019s intent to prevent the witness from testifying. 232 P.3d 519, 522 (Utah 2010). The trial court made several findings regarding the overwhelming evidence of Defendant\u2019s wrongful acts and his intent. First, Wilson disclosed that, as they were being transported to the courthouse for trial, Defendant threatened to kill Wilson and his family. A detention officer also testified that she heard Defendant threaten Wilson. Second, in a taped interview with homicide detectives and assistant district attorneys, Wilson repeatedly expressed his concern that his life and the lives of his family members were in jeopardy.\nFinally, Defendant made several phone calls that evidenced his intent to intimidate Wilson. In one call to his grandmother, Defendant repeatedly referred to Wilson as \u201cnigger\u201d and stated he would \u201cstraighten this nigger out[,]\u201d a reference to intimidating Wilson to keep him quiet. Also during the phone calls, Defendant joked about the \u201cslick moves\u201d that he used to prevent Wilson from testifying. In other calls, Defendant instructed several acquaintances (including \u201cGreasy,\u201d \u201cMad Dog,\u201d and others) to come to court to intimidate Wilson while he was testifying. One of the parties Defendant spoke to said he would be in court on the morning of 2 March 2011. On that date, Wilson, who had already been hesitant and fearful on the stand, became even more emotional and \u201cbroke down\u201d when he saw a young man dressed in street clothes indicative of gang attire enter the courtroom.\nDefendant argues that, because Wilson did not know about these phone calls, \u201c[t]heir relevance is marginal at best\u201d in determining the reason Wilson chose to discontinue his testimony. We disagree. The calls were highly relevant in determining whether to apply the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing in that they showed Defendant (1) wanted to intimidate Wilson and prevent him from testifying; (2) formed a plan to intimidate Wilson by having Defendant\u2019s acquaintances appear in the court room while Wilson was on the stand; and (3) believed his \u201cslick moves\u201d would be effective in intimidating Wilson.\nMuch of Defendant\u2019s argument on appeal centers on the correctness of the court\u2019s finding of fact concerning the presence of a spectator at trial described as \u201ca young Afro-American male dressed in urban attire (low hanging baggie pants and hoodie) indicative of gang attire.\u201d There was no dispute at trial that such a spectator entered the courtroom on 2 March. The trial judge recalled that the young man had entered while Wilson was still on the stand, while defense counsel believed Wilson had already been taken out of the courtroom. The judge\u2019s memory of the timing was competent evidence and supports this finding of fact. Further, the remaining findings, including Defendant\u2019s threat to harm Wilson and his family and his bragging about doing so, along with Wilson\u2019s obvious fear, were more than sufficient to establish Defendant\u2019s efforts and intent to intimidate Wilson.\nWe likewise reject Defendant\u2019s contention that application of the doctrine was improper because Wilson never testified that he chose to remain silent out of fear of Defendant. It would be nonsensical to require that a witness testify against a defendant in order to establish that the defendant has intimidated the witness into not testifying. Put simply, if a witness is afraid to testify against a defendant in regard to the crime charged, we believe that witness will surely be afraid to finger the defendant for having threatened the witness, itself a criminal offense. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-226 (2011). Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that a trial court cannot make reasonable inferences about the cause of a witness\u2019s refusal to testify based upon the facts and circumstances before it.\nAs Defendant notes, this Court has interpreted United States Supreme Court case law as demonstrating a \u201creluctance to uphold forfeiture of a criminal defendant\u2019s U.S. Constitutional rights, except in egregious circumstances.\u201d State v. Wray, _ N.C. App._, _, 698 S.E.2d 137, 140-41 (2010). The evidence here could hardly be more egregious. We see no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that Defendant forfeited his right to confront Wilson.\nIn light of the overwhelming evidence regarding Defendant\u2019s acts, the intention behind them, and their effect on Wilson, as well as the court\u2019s thoughtful, well-reasoned analysis thereof, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial.\nNO ERROR.\nJudges STROUD and BEASLEY concur.\n. Defendant also argues that the court erred in denying his motion to strike Wilson\u2019s testimony, but our review of the record reveals no motion to strike by Defendant. Because a party must present a \u201ctimely request, objection, or motion\u201d to the trial court and obtain a ruling thereon in order to preserve an issue for appeal, we do not address this portion of Defendant\u2019s argument. See N.C.R. App. P. 10(a)(1).\n. Our Supreme Court has only briefly mentioned the doctrine in dicta. See State v. Lewis, 361 N.C. 541, 648 S.E.2d 824 (2007).\n. The Utah court used a preponderance of the evidence standard, id. at 525, while the trial court here applied the higher standard of clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Because employing a higher standard of proof benefits Defendant, he does not assert any abuse of the court\u2019s discretion on this point and we see none.", "author": "STEPHENS, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

After careful review, we affirm.\nI. Factual & Procedural Background\nOn 5 March 2010, a Rockingham County jury convicted Brian Wendell Rhodes, Jr. (\u201cDefendant\u201d) on charges of possession with intent to manufacture, sell, or deliver cocaine and possessing drug paraphernalia. The State\u2019s evidence at trial, as summarized in this Court\u2019s prior unpublished decision, State v. Rhodes, No. COA10-784 (N.C. App. January 4, 2011), appeal dismissed, disc. rev. denied, 365 N.C. 196, 709 S.E.2d 921 (2011), tended to show the following:\nOn 6 February 2008, Lieutenant David Frizzell of the Reidsville Police Department (\u201cLieutenant Frizzell\u201d) went to 1001 Fawn Circle in Reidsville, North Carolina, to execute a search warrant. The subjects of the search warrant were the defendant and his father, Brian Rhodes, Sr. (\u201cRhodes\u201d). Officers knocked on the door and announced their presence and then used a battering ram to open the locked door. Defendant, who Lieutenant Frizzell described as argumentative, was ordered to the floor and restrained with handcuffs. Officers then began searching the residence for narcotics.\nSergeant Jimmy Hutchens of the Reidsville Police Department (\u201cSergeant Hutchens\u201d) assisted with the execution of the search warrant. Sergeant Hutchens testified that during the search, while defendant was restrained, he noticed that defendant was having difficulty breathing. Defendant asked Sergeant Hutchens for his medication, and Sergeant Hutchens asked defendant where he kept the medication. Defendant told Sergeant Hutchens that \u201cit was in his bedroom, which was to the left at the top of the stairs.\u201d Sergeant Hutchens relayed the information to Lieutenant Frizzell, who retrieved defendant\u2019s medication from on top of a dresser in the bedroom and threw it downstairs to Sergeant Hutchens. Sergeant Hutchens then gave the medication to defendant.\nAfter retrieving defendant\u2019s medication, Coumadin, Lieutenant Frizzell searched the room in which he found defendant\u2019s medication. Officer Woody Hutchens (\u201cOfficer Hutchens\u201d) of the Reidsville Police Department assisted him with the search. Officer Hutchens located \u201c\u00e1 shoebox in the top of the closet with a white, powdery substance in it, as well as a green vegetable, leafy substance.\u201d Officer Hutchens also found a black bag inside the shoebox that had a large bag of white powder, a strainer, scales, and cash. Officer Hutchens next searched the dresser from where Lieutenant Frizzell had retrieved defendant\u2019s medication. Officer Hutchens found defendant\u2019s identification on the dresser. Defendant\u2019s identification had been issued three months earlier, and it listed defendant\u2019s address as 1001 Fawn Circle in Reidsville, North Carolina. Finally, inside the dresser, Officer Hutchens found \u201ca black box with a small bag that appeared to be crack rocks in it.\u201d\nId. at *1.\nDefendant\u2019s evidence at trial tended to show that Defendant was not living with his parents and sister at their residence in Reidsville on the evening of 6 February 2008, when the police searched and discovered drugs and drug paraphernalia at that residence. Defendant\u2019s mother (\u201cMrs. Rhodes\u201d) testified that Defendant had lived in Greensboro since 2006, that Defendant was visiting on the night in question, and that Defendant had been in the house for \u201c[pjrobably about five or ten minutes\u201d when the police arrived to execute the search warrant. Mrs. Rhodes further testified that the cocaine and marijuana recovered by the police during their search of the residence did not belong to her or Defendant. Defendant\u2019s father (\u201cMr. Rhodes\u201d) also took the stand and testified that the drugs recovered by the police did not belong to Mrs. Rhodes or Defendant. Mr. Rhodes admitted that he had been convicted of various drug-related offenses over the course of the past ten years and, when asked whether the drugs found by the police were his, Mr. Rhodes replied: \u201cI plead the Fifth.\u201d\nThe jury convicted Defendant on all charges, and the trial court sentenced Defendant to six to eight months\u2019 imprisonment. Judge Stone suspended Defendant\u2019s sentence and placed Defendant on supervised probation for a period of thirty months. Defendant appealed his convictions to this Court, and we found no error in Defendant\u2019s trial. Id. The North Carolina Supreme Court subsequently denied Defendant\u2019s petition for discretionary review. See State v. Rhodes, 365 N.C. 196, 196, 709 S.E.2d 921, 921-22 (2011).\nOn 28 May 2010, Defendant filed a motion for appropriate relief in Rockingham County Superior Court and moved for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. In his motion, Defendant alleged that following his convictions on the drug charges, Mr. Rhodes confessed to a probation officer that the drugs and drug paraphernalia that had served as the basis for Defendant\u2019s convictions actually belonged to him.\nDefendant\u2019s motion for appropriate relief came before Judge Stone at a hearing held on 25 July 2011. Defendant testified that when he went to report at the probation office following his convictions on the drug charges, Mr. Rhodes accompanied him and informed one of the probation officers at the office that the drugs in question were his. Virginia Bullins, the probation officer to whom Mr. Rhodes allegedly confessed, also testified at the hearing and corroborated Defendant\u2019s testimony.\nBy order entered 29 July 2011, the trial court concluded that Mr. Rhodes\u2019 confession to Officer Bullins \u201cis newly discovered evidence, clearly pointing to the guilt of another.\u201d The trial court set aside Defendant\u2019s convictions and awarded Defendant a new trial. The State filed its notice of appeal with this Court on 1 August 2011.\nII. Jurisdiction\nThis appeal is properly before us, as the State appeals from the superior court\u2019s order granting a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence as a matter of right. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1445(a)(2) (2011); see also State v. Monroe, 330 N.C. 433, 436, 410 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1991) (holding that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1445(a)(2) \u201cgrants the State an absolute right to appellate review of a superior court order granting defendant a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence\u201d).\nIII. Analysis\nThe State contends the trial court erred when it granted Defendant\u2019s motion for appropriate relief and awarded Defendant a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. For the reasons that follow, we disagree with the State\u2019s contentions, and we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Defendant a new trial based on the new evidence.\nA. Standard of Review\nTo prevail on a motion for appropriate relief based on newly discovered evidence, a criminal defendant must establish the following:\n(1) [A] witness or witnesses will give newly discovered evidence; (2) the newly discovered evidence is probably true; (3) the evidence is material, competent and relevant; (4) due diligence was used and proper means were employed to procure the testimony at trial; (5) the newly discovered evidence is not merely cumulative or corroborative; (6) the new evidence does not merely tend to contradict, impeach or discredit the testimony of a former witness; and (7) the evidence is of such a nature that a different result will probably be reached at a new trial.\nState v. Beaver, 291 N.C. 137, 143, 229 S.E.2d 179, 183 (1976). The defendant has \u201cthe burden at the hearing on his motion for appropriate relief \u2018of establishing the facts essential to his claim by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d State v. Hardison, 143 N.C. App. 114, 120, 545 S.E.2d 233, 237 (2001) (citation omitted); N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1420(c)(5) (2011).\n\u201cThe decision of whether to grant a new trial in a criminal case on the ground of newly discovered evidence is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and is not subject to review absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. Findings of fact made by the trial court are binding on appeal if they are supported by the evidence.\u201d\nState v. Stukes, 153 N.C. App. 770, 773, 571 S.E.2d 241, 244 (2002) (quoting State v. Wiggins, 334 N.C. 18, 38, 431 S.E.2d 755, 767 (1993)). The question of whether there is sufficient evidence to support a factual finding entered by the trial court is a question of law, and thus fully reviewable on appeal. See State v. Wilkins, 131 N.C. App. 220, 223, 506 S.E.2d 274, 276 (1998). Accordingly, we undertake a de novo review of the questions of law presented by the State\u2019s appeal in the instant case, while affording great deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusions on these questions as required under our abuse of discretion standard.\nBefore applying our standard of review in the case sub judice, however, we note that in its order the trial court labeled two determinations as both findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court found as fact, inter alia, the following:\nThe confession to the probation officer is newly discovered evidence^]\nThe newly discovered evidence is probably true.\nThese \u201cfindings of fact,\u201d which are also labeled by the trial court as \u201cconclusions of law,\u201d reflect two of the seven requirements that must be established by a criminal defendant in moving for appropriate relief based upon newly discovered evidence. See Beaver, 291 N.C. at 143, 229 S.E.2d at 183. In its order, the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law mirror these seven requirements. A determination that the defendant has met his burden in satisfying one of these requirements involves the application of legal principles and judicial reasoning and is more properly classified as a conclusion of law. See In re Helms, 127 N.C. App. 505, 510, 491 S.E.2d 672, 675 (1997). We therefore reclassify these mislabeled \u201cfindings of fact\u201d as conclusions of law and apply our standard of review accordingly. See N.C. State Bar v. Key, 189 N.C. App. 80, 88, 658 S.E.2d 493, 499 (2008) (\u201c[C]lassification of an item within the order is not determinative, and, when necessary, the appellate court can reclassify an item before applying the appropriate standard of review.\u201d).\nB. The State\u2019s Appeal\nThe State first contends Defendant failed to produce newly discovered evidence because the information revealed by Mr. Rhodes\u2019 confession could have been elicited through due diligence at trial. We disagree.\nDefendant was required to establish before the trial court that a \u201cwitness or witnesses will give newly discovered evidence,\u201d and, further, that \u201cdue diligence was used and proper means were employed to procure the testimony at trial.\u201d Beaver, 291 N.C. at 143, 229 S.E.2d at 183. \u201cNewly discovered evidence is evidence which was in existence but not known to a party at the time of trial.\u201d State v. Nickerson, 320 N.C. 603, 609, 359 S.E.2d 760, 763 (1987).\nIn the instant case, Defendant offered Officer Bullins\u2019 testimony regarding Mr. Rhodes\u2019 confession as newly discovered evidence. Mr. Rhodes did not admit to exclusive ownership of the drugs in question until after Defendant\u2019s trial. As an out of court statement against interest, the defense would have been able to examine Mr. Rhodes during its case regarding this issue. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 804(b)(3) (2011). Without this admission the evidence of ownership of the drugs was ambiguous as to whether Defendant, Mr. Rhodes, or both Defendant and Mr. Rhodes owned or possessed the drugs. Officer Bullins\u2019 testimony regarding Mr. Rhodes\u2019 confession is therefore newly discovered evidence.\nMoreover, the defense exercised due diligence in attempting to procure this information at trial by calling Mr. Rhodes as witness and specifically asking him whether the drugs in question were his. Mr. Rhodes elected to exercise his constitutional right against self-incrimination, prompting the trial court to excuse Mr. Rhodes as a witness and thus ensuring that defense counsel would have no further opportunity to elicit testimony from Mr. Rhodes.'\nThe defense also called Mrs. Rhodes as a witness, and the following exchange took place between defense counsel and Mrs. Rhodes on redirect examination:\n[Defense counsel]: The cocaine. Was the cocaine and marijuana, was it yours?\n[Mrs. Rhodes]: No.\n[Defense counsel]: Okay. Was it Mr. Rhodes?\n[Mrs. Rhodes]: I\u2019m not going to answer that. That\u2019s my husband.\n[Defense counsel]: No, I\u2019m saying your son.\n[Mrs. Rhodes]: Oh, no.\nWhile it is true defense counsel did not press Mrs. Rhodes on the question of whether the drugs in question belonged to Mr. Rhodes, it is clear from the preceding exchange that Mrs. Rhodes was unwilling to implicate her husband and that any attempt to elicit this information would have been futile. We also note that defense counsel did not ask Defendant during his trial testimony whether the drugs belonged to Mr. Rhodes. However, Defendant may not have known who possessed the drugs, and, moreover, we cannot say that defense counsel\u2019s failure to cast aspersions upon Mr. Rhodes to the maximum extent possible equates to a lack of due diligence. We hold the trial court did not err in concluding that Defendant established the due diligence requirement.\nThe State next takes issue with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Rhodes\u2019 confession was \u201cprobably true.\u201d See Beaver, 291 N.C. at 143, 229 S.E.2d at 183. The State insists that the trial court was presented with insufficient evidence to make this determination. We disagree. As the State concedes, \u201cit is for the trial court to assess the credibility of a witness.\u201d State v. Williamson, _ N.C. App. _, _, 698 S.E.2d 727, 731 (2010), vacated on other grounds, 365 N.C. 326, _ S.E.2d _ (2011). Judge Stone presided over Defendant\u2019s trial and was intimately familiar with the circumstances of the case. In addition, Judge Stone took judicial notice of Mr. Rhodes\u2019 \u201chistory of violating drug laws in the past,\u201d which was information previously revealed during defense counsel\u2019s direct examination of Mr. Rhodes at trial. Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in concluding that the newly discovered evidence is probably true.\nThe State further contends that Mr. Rhodes\u2019 confession would not exculpate Defendant in a new trial. See Beaver, 291 N.C. at 143, 229 S.E.2d at 183 (requiring the new evidence be \u201cof such a nature that a different result will probably be reached at a new trial\u201d). We disagree.\nThe jury in the instant case could have concluded based on the circumstances that Defendant, Mr. Rhodes, or Defendant and Mr. Rhodes owned or possessed the drugs in question. However, while a jury may draw adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they assert their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, see Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1975), the Fifth Amendment does not permit the jury to draw such inferences in a criminal case. See Namet v. United States, 373 U.S. 179, 185-86 (1963). Thus, the jury here was not permitted to infer from Mr. Rhodes\u2019 exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights that he owned or possessed the drugs in question. See State v. Pickens, 346 N.C. 628, 639, 488 S.E.2d 162, 168 (1997). The jury was presented with no evidence other than the circumstances under which the drugs were recovered to determine who owned or possessed them. With this new evidence\u2014Mr. Rhodes\u2019 confession\u2014a new jury would now have an affirmative statement that Mr. Rhodes alone possessed the drugs. We hold this evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the newly discovered evidence would probably result in a different outcome at a new trial.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe have carefully reviewed Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments, and we conclude they are without merit. Therefore, as we have determined the trial court did not err in concluding that Defendant met his burden with respect to each of the seven requirements for a new trial on grounds of newly discovered evidence, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting Defendant\u2019s motion for appropriate relief and awarding Defendant a new trial.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order of the trial court.\nAffirmed.\nJudge BEASLEY concurs.\nJudge BRYANT concurs in the result only.", "author": "HUNTER, JR., Robert N., Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

After careful consideration of Defendant\u2019s challenges to the trial court\u2019s order in light of the record and the applicable law, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order should be affirmed.\nI. Background\nA. Substantive Facts\nIrene Shoaf was born on 23 March 1921 and died on 5 October 2009. Plaintiffs are Ms. Shoaf\u2019s adult children, while Defendant is her grandson. After Ms. Shoaf\u2019s husband died in 1976, she lived alone in Winston-Salem. In 1998, Defendant began living with Ms. Shoaf and assisting her with carrying out various daily activities, including buying her groceries and household supplies, taking her to the doctor, and managing her bank accounts and other financial matters.\nIn December 2000 and January 2001, Ms. Shoaf conveyed some or all of her residence to Defendant and moved into a condominium, leaving Defendant in sole possession of her former residence. Between 2002 and 2009, Defendant engaged in a variety of transactions involving certain of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s assets. In September 2002, Defendant utilized Ms. Shoaf\u2019s home to secure a $50,000.00 line of credit. On 23 February 2005, Ms. Shoaf executed a power of attorney naming Defendant as her attorney in fact, and executed a deed transferring a 2.378 acre tract of real property to Defendant. According to this power of attorney, which remained in effect throughout the remainder of her life, Defendant had the authority to act for Ms. Shoaf.\nAfter engaging in these transactions, Defendant married Crystal Shoaf. In April 2005, Defendant and Crystal Shoaf encumbered Ms. Shoaf\u2019s home with a deed of trust that secured a $214,900.00 loan. Subsequently, Ms. Shoaf\u2019s health declined and her mental condition deteriorated. In October, 2006, Defendant took Ms. Shoaf to an attorney\u2019s office, where she executed a will in which she left half of her estate to Defendant.\nB. Procedural History\nAfter Ms. Shoaf\u2019s death, the Forsyth County Clerk admitted to probate a document dated 18 October 2006 and entitled the \u201cLast Will and Testament of Irene Garwood Shoaf\u2019 (\u201cthe contested will\u201d), in which Ms. Shoaf left her property to Plaintiffs and Defendant. As of the time of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s death, her estate had no assets. On 9 November 2010, Plaintiffs filed a caveat in which they alleged that the contested will lacked validity because Ms. Shoaf did not have \u201csufficient mental capacity to make and execute a will at the time the document was signed\u201d and because \u201cexecution of the document was procured by undue influence.\u201d On 19 November 2010, Plaintiffs filed a separate civil action against Defendant in which they sought compensatory and punitive damages for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and constructive fraud and asked to have certain instruments that Ms. Shoaf executed in favor of Defendant set aside or to have a constructive trust in favor of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s estate imposed on the property transferred pursuant to those instruments based upon allegations of fraud, Defendant\u2019s failure to pay the purchase price, and Ms. Shoaf\u2019s lack of mental capacity to enter into these transactions. On 26 January 2011, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss or stay Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action in which he argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter implicated by Plaintiffs\u2019 claims; that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the prior pending action doctrine; that Plaintiffs had failed to state claims for which relief could be granted; that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations; and that Plaintiffs lacked standing to seek to have assets transferred from Defendant to Ms. Shoaf\u2019s estate. On 25 March 2011, the trial court entered an order denying Defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action for an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the existence of a prior pending action, failure to plead the claims asserted in the complaint with sufficient specificity, and failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted and to stay the separate civil proceeding pending completion of the caveat proceeding. Defendant noted an appeal to this Court from the trial court\u2019s order.\nII. Legal Analysis\nA. Standard of Review\nIn his brief, Defendant contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the basis of the prior pending action doctrine;, by denying his motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and by failing, in the alternative, to order that Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action be stayed until resolution of the issues that have been raised in the caveat proceeding. As a result of the fact that Defendant\u2019s dismissal motions raise issues of law, the trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is subject to do novo review. Transp. Servs. of N.C., Inc. v. Wake Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 198 N.C. App. 590, 593, 680 S.E.2d 223, 225 (2009) (stating that \u201c[t]his Court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss\u201d). However, we review a trial court order denying a request for a stay using an abuse of discretion standard. Lawyers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Nexsen Pruet Jacobs & Pollard, 112 N.C. App. 353, 356, 435 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1993) (utilizing an abuse of discretion standard to review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a stay pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-75.12).\nB. Prior Pending Action\nAccording to Defendant, the caveat proceeding is a prior pending action. Defendant argues that, since the caveat and Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action involve the same parties and the same legal issues, the caveat bars the maintenance of Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action. We do not find this argument persuasive.\n\u201cUnder the law of this state, where a prior action is pending between the same parties for the same subject matter in a court within the state having like jurisdiction, the prior action serves to abate the subsequent action.\u201d Eways v. Governor\u2019s Island, 326 N.C. 552, 558, 391 S.E.2d 182, 185 (1990) (citing McDowell v. Blythe Brothers Co., 236 N.C. 396, 398, 72 S.E.2d 860, 862 (1952)) (other citation omitted). \u201cThe \u2018prior pending action\u2019 doctrine involves \u2018essentially the same questions as the outmoded plea of abatement,\u2019 and is, obviously enough, intended to prevent the maintenance of a \u2018subsequent action [that] is wholly unnecessary[.]\u2019 \u201d Jessee v. Jessee, _ N.C. App. _, _, 713 S.E.2d 28, 37 (2011) (quoting Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Douglas, 148 N.C. App. 195, 197, 557 S.E.2d 592, 593 (2001), and State ex rel. Onslow County v. Mercer, 128 N.C. App. 371, 375, 496 S.E.2d 585, 587 (1998)). \u201c \u2018The ordinary test for determining whether or not the parties and causes are the same for the purpose of abatement by reason of the pendency of the prior action is this: Do the two actions present a substantial identity as to parties, subject matter, issues involved, and relief demanded?\u2019 \u201d Jessee, _ N.C. App. at _, 713 S.E.2d at 37 (quoting Cameron v. Cameron, 235 N.C. 82, 85, 68 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1952), and citing Clark v. Craven Regional Medical Authority, 326 N.C. 15, 20, 387 S.E.2d 168, 171 (1990)). Although the caveat and Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil claim involve the same parties, the two proceedings do not present the same legal issues or demand the same relief.\nThe caveat proceeding initiated by Plaintiffs seeks a judgment that the 18 October 2006 will lacks validity on the grounds that Ms. Shoaf lacked the mental capacity to make a will at the time of its execution and that the execution of the contested will was procured by undue influence on the part of Defendant. \u201cA person has testamentary capacity within the meaning of the law if he has a clear understanding of the nature and extent of his act, of the kind and value of the property devised, of the persons who are the natural objects of his bounty, and of the manner in which he desires to dispose of property to be distributed[.]\u201d In re Staub\u2019s Will, 172 N.C. 138, 141, 90 S.E. 119, 121 (1916) (citation omitted). The \u201ccompetency of a testator to make a will is to be determined as of the date of its execution. Evidence of capacity at other times is important only in so far as it tends to show mental condition at the time of such execution.\u201d In re Will of Hall, 252 N.C. 70, 77, 113 S.E.2d 1, 6, (1960) (citing In re Will of Hargrove, 206 N.C. 307, 309, 173 S.E. 577 (1934), and In re Will of Stocks, 175 N.C. 224, 225, 95 S.E. 360, 361 (1918)). Similarly, \u201cundue influence\u201d is \u201c \u2018something operating upon the mind of the person whose act is called in judgment, of sufficient controlling effect to destroy free agency and to render the instrument, brought in question, not properly an expression of the wishes of the maker, but rather the expression of the will of another.\u2019 \u201d In re Will of Jones, 362 N.C. 569, 574, 669 S.E.2d 572, 577 (2008) (quoting In re Will of Turnage, 208 N.C. 130, 131, 179 S.E. 332, 333 (1935)). As a result, the issues raised by the caveat are whether Ms. Shoaf had the requisite mental capacity to execute a will on 18 October 2006 and whether the execution of the contested will was procured by undue influence on the part of Defendant. Although a verdict in favor of Plaintiffs in the caveat proceeding would result in the disposition of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s estate on some basis other than that set forth in the contested will, such a verdict would not determine what assets should properly be considered to belong to Ms. Shoaf\u2019s estate.\nIn their separate civil action, on the other hand, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant improperly obtained possession of some of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s assets during her lifetime; converted in excess of $100,000 in funds and various items of personal property to his own use; engaged in constructive fraud by effectuating various transactions involving Ms. Shoaf for his own benefit; and took advantage of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s declining mental and physical faculties to obtain property to which he was not entitled. \u201cThe simple definition of conversion is \u2018an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of their condition or the exclusion of an owner\u2019s rights.\u2019 \u201d Mace v. Pyatt, 203 N.C. App. 245, 256, 691 S.E.2d 81, 90 (2010) (quoting Myers v. Catoe Construction Co., 80 N.C. App. 692, 695, 343 S.E.2d 281, 283 (1986)), disc. review denied, 364 N.C. 614, 705 S.E.2d 354 (2010). \u201c \u2018The elements of a constructive fraud claim are proof of circumstances (1) which created the relation of trust and confidence [the \u2018fiduciary\u2019 relationship], and (2) [which] led up to and surrounded the consummation of the transaction in which defendant is alleged to have taken advantage of his position of trust to the hurt of plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d Bogovich v. Embassy Club of Sedgefield, _ N.C. App _, _, 712 S.E.2d 257, 262 (2011) (quoting Keener Lumber Co. v. Perry, 149 N.C. App. 19, 28, 560 S.E.2d 817, 823, disc. review denied, 356 N.C. 164, 568 S.E.2d 196 (2002) (internal citation omitted). In the event that they were to prevail in the separate civil action, Plaintiffs might be entitled to the entry of a judgment invalidating the transfer of certain items of property from Ms. Shoaf to Defendant, requiring the conveyance of certain assets from Defendant to Ms. Shoaf\u2019s estate, and awarding compensatory and punitive damages. Aside from the fact that the claims asserted in Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action have different elements and require proof of different facts from those at issue in the caveat proceeding, Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action does not involve a challenge to the validity of the contested will or require either a determination of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s capacity to execute a will as of 18 October 2006 or the extent to which Defendant procured the contested will by undue influence. As a result, after carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that the two proceedings do not involve the same legal issues or request the same relief, that the existence of the caveat proceeding does not preclude the maintenance of Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action, and that the trial court did not err by denying Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of the prior pending action doctrine.\nIn urging us to reach a contrary result, Defendant argues that the separate civil action and the caveat \u201cboth concern four central issues,\u201d which Defendant characterizes as (1) the validity of the 18 October 2006 will; (2) whether Defendant owed a fiduciary duty to Ms. Shoaf; (3) whether the contested will was procured by Defendant\u2019s undue influence; and (4) the extent to which Ms. Shoaf was competent to execute a will on 18 October 2006. However, a proper resolution of the issues before the trial court in the caveat proceeding does not require consideration of the extent to which Defendant owed a fiduciary duty to Ms. Shoaf. Similarly, a proper resolution of the issues raised by the separate civil action does not require a determination of the validity of the contested will, whether Ms. Shoaf was mentally competent to execute a will on 18 October 2006, or whether the execution of the contested will was procured by undue influence. Although both proceedings do, at a very general level, arise from interactions between Defendant and Ms. Shoaf, the caveat proceeding focuses exclusively on Ms. Shoaf\u2019s mental state on 18 October 2006 and the extent of Defendant\u2019s influence over the execution of the contested will while the separate civil action is focused exclusively on whether Defendant unlawfully or improperly obtained ownership of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s assets during her lifetime. As a result, we conclude, contrary to Defendant\u2019s contention, that the two proceedings are not focused on the same \u201cfour central issues.\u201d\nIn addition, Defendant cites Baars v. Campbell Univ., Inc., 148 N.C. App. 408, 558 S.E.2d 871, disc. review denied, 355 N.C. 490, 563 S.E.2d 563 (2002), for the proposition that the caveat constitutes a prior pending action. In Baars, the plaintiffs filed a caveat seeking to have the decedent\u2019s will invalidated on undue influence grounds and a separate civil action in which they alleged that the defendants had breached a fiduciary duty owed to the decedent and requested that a constructive trust be imposed on all assets that the defendants had acquired, directly or indirectly, from the decedent either during her life or after her death. On appeal, this Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action on the grounds that the claims asserted in that proceeding were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, stating that, \u201cafter determining that plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit is governed by the three-year statute of limitations, we conclude that plaintiffs were not timely with any of their filings.\u201d Baars, 148 N.C. App at 417, 558 S.E.2d at 876. In addition, we noted that both the caveat and the separate civil action challenged the validity of the underlying will and stated that, \u201cto the extent\u201d that the civil action involved a challenge to the decedent\u2019s will or an assertion that the defendants had improperly obtained property as a result of the admission of the disputed will to probate, the exclusive remedy available to the plaintiff was a caveat proceeding. As a result, we conclude that Baars is not controlling in this case because Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, unlike the complaint at issue in Baars, does not challenge the validity of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s will or seek to recover property obtained pursuant to that instrument.\nThus, as the trial court appears to have recognized, the caveat challenges the validity of the contested will while the separate civil action asserts claims arising from Defendant\u2019s involvement in transactions that occurred during Ms. Shoaf\u2019s lifetime for the purpose of seeking to have certain property returned to Ms. Shoaf\u2019s estate. Simply put, the two cases involve different issues and different requests for relief. For that reason, we conclude that the trial court did not err by denying Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action on the basis of the prior pending action doctrine.\nC. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\nSecondly, Defendant argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action because it constituted an \u201cimpermissible collateral attack\u201d on the validity of Ms. Shoaf\u2019s will. Johnson v. Stevenson, 269 N.C. 200, 204, 152 S.E.2d 214, 217 (1967) (stating that \u201c[t]he right of direct attack by caveat gave [the plaintiff] a full and complete remedy at law\u201d depriving her of the right to seek equitable relief) (citing Insurance Co. v. Guilford County, 225 N.C. 293, 300, 34 S.E.2d 430, 434 (1945). In support of this contention, Defendant argues that both the caveat proceeding and the separate civil action involve issues pertaining to Ms. Shoaf\u2019s capacity to engage in certain transactions and to execute various documents at different times between 2005 and Ms. Shoaf\u2019s death in 2009. More specifically, Defendant notes that Plaintiffs allege in their separate civil action that:\nIn October 2006, defendant took Irene to a local lawyer . . . and defendant caused Irene to execute a will that left half of her property to defendant. Defendant knew that, by October 2006, Irene\u2019s doctors had diagnosed Irene as suffering from dementia and memory loss and that Irene lacked the mental capacity to make and execute a will. This episode was part of a continuing pattern whereby defendant breached his fiduciary duty to Irene and took advantage of her declining mental health, all to his benefit.\nThe inclusion of this allegation to the effect that, as part of a continuing pattern of attempting to obtain Ms. Shoafs assets, Defendant had Ms. Shoaf execute a will that benefitted him personally, despite knowing that she was in no condition to do so, represents nothing more than an assertion of alleged fact and does not constitute an attempt to obtain the entry of a judgment invalidating the contested will. On the contrary, the complaint that Plaintiffs filed in the separate civil action does not seek a determination of the validity of the contested will or require the trial court to make such a determination in the course of deciding other issues. As a result, given that the \u201ccollateral attack\u201d argument is the only basis upon which Defendant has challenged the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter implicated in Plaintiffs\u2019 separate civil action, we hold that the trial court did not err by denying Defendant\u2019s request that Plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nD. Stay\nFinally, Defendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to stay Plaintiffs\u2019 civil action until the caveat proceeding had been resolved. According to Defendant, \u201cthe Caveat and Civil Action will be tried on the same issues and staying the Civil Action will avoid inconsistent verdicts on those issues.\u201d More particularly, Defendant contends that, in the absence of the requested stay, the jury in the caveat proceeding might find that the contested will was valid and the jury in the separate civil action might find that Ms. Shoaf lacked the mental capacity to properly execute certain other disputed instruments at various times between 2005 and 2009. However, since the validity of the contested will is not at issue in the separate civil action, the jury empanelled to decide that proceeding would not need to determine whether Ms. Shoaf had the capacity to execute that instrument. Moreover, \u201cthe competency or incompetency of a testator to engage in or understand any complicated matter or transaction in business is not a proper test of his mental capacity to execute a will.\u201d In re Will of Maynard, 64 N.C. App. 211, 226, 307 S.E.2d 416, 427 (1983) (citation omitted), disc. review denied, 310 N.C. 477, 312 S.E.2d 885 (1984). As a result, since the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Defendant\u2019s stay motion did not expose Defendant to the possibility of legally inconsistent verdicts, its decision to that effect did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIII. Conclusion\nThus, for the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the trial court did not err by denying Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 civil action on the basis of the prior pending action doctrine or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or by denying Defendant\u2019s motion to stay the separate civil action pending resolution of the caveat proceeding. As a result, the trial court\u2019s order should be and hereby is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\nJudges BEASLEY and THIGPEN concur.\n. Although Bryan Thompson was named as a party defendant in his capacity as representative of Irene Shoaf\u2019s estate, Mr. Thompson is a \u201cnominal defendant against whom no judgment is demanded and no relief asked.\u201d Barnhardt v. Smith, 86 N.C. 473, 478 (1882). As a result of the fact that Mr. Thompson did not note an appeal from the trial court\u2019s order, the word \u201cDefendant\u201d as used in this opinion refers exclusively to Jeffery S. Shoaf.\n. Although the order from which Defendant has noted an appeal is clearly interlocutory, this Court has held that the denial of a dismissal motion predicated on the prior pending action doctrine is immediately appealable. Stevens v. Henry, 121 N.C. App. 150,154, 464 S.E.2d 704, 707 (1995) (stating that [\u201ca] denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground that there is a prior pending action is immediately appealable\u201d) (citing Atkins v. Nash, 61 N.C. App. 488, 489, 300 S.E.2d 880, 881 (1983)). In view of the fact that we clearly have jurisdiction over Defendant\u2019s prior pending action claim and the fact that all three of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are interrelated, we elect to address Defendant\u2019s remaining claims on the merits as well, Newcomb v. County of Carteret,_N.C. App. _,_, 701 S.E.2d 325, 338-39 (2010), disc, review denied, 365 N.C. 212, 710 S.E.2d 26 (2011), without expressing any opinion concerning the validity of Defendant\u2019s contention that the challenged orders affect a substantial right.\n.

Warded, for Defendants-Appellants.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "BEASLEY, Judge.\nJeffrey Martin Smith, individually and in his official capacity; Worth Hill, individually and in his official capacity as the Sheriff of Durham County, North Carolina; Durham County, North Carolina; The Durham County North Carolina Sheriffs Office; and Unknown Surety Company (collectively, Defendants) appeal from a 27 April 2011 order denying their motion to dismiss the above-captioned matter. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\nLinda Carol Robinson and her husband, John Charles Robinson (Plaintiffs) filed a complaint on 26 July 2010 against Jeffrey Smith in his official capacity and his employer, Durham County, alleging Smith negligently ran into Plaintiffs\u2019 car and injured Mrs. Robinson while acting in the course of his employment. On 23 August 2010, both Smith and Durham County filed motions to dismiss. On 1 December 2010, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, which named all the present Defendants. On 7 January 2011, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint. On 27 April 2011, the trial court entered an order recognizing Plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint as the operative complaint in this proceeding and denying Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. On 9 May 2011, Defendants gave notice of appeal to this court.\nAt the outset, we note that this appeal is interlocutory, and would normally not be properly before us. \u201cHowever, an interlocutory order may be heard in appellate courts if it affects a substantial right[,]\u201d and \u201c[t]his Court has held that denial of dispositive motions such as motions to dismiss . . . that are grounded on governmental immunity affect a substantial right and are immediately appealable.\u201d Mabrey v. Smith, 144 N.C. App. 119, 121, 548 S.E.2d 183, 185 (2001) (internal citations omitted). Thus, this interlocutory appeal is properly before this Court.\nI.\nDefendants argue that the trial court erred in considering Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. We disagree.\nPursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(a) (2011), \u201c[a] party may am\u00e9nd his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served[.]\u201d Here, Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint was served on them after they had served a responsive pleading. Instead, they argue that because Plaintiffs\u2019 amendment added an additional party, it was not governed by Rule 15 but by Rules 20-21 of Civil Procedure, which Defendants contend require notice to existing litigants and leave of court when an amendment adds a party. Defendants\u2019 argument is without merit.\nAs the trial court stated, Rules 20 and 21 have no bearing on the instant case. Rule 20 governs permissive joinder and Rule 21 pertains to misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rules 20 and 21 (2011). Neither rule is applicable here. Defendants further point to this Court\u2019s decision in Coffey v. Coffey, 94 N.C. App. 717, 381 S.E.2d 467 (1989) in support of their argument. However, Coffey is not applicable here either, as the defendant in that case had filed an answer and plaintiff was only permitted to amend her pleadings by leave of court or by written consent of the defendant under Rule 15(a). Id. at 722, 381 S.E.2d at 471. The rationale in Coffey is only applicable to cases where a responsive pleading has been filed prior to the proposed amendment; because no such pleading was filed here, this case is easily distinguishable. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in considering Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint to be the operative complaint in this action.\nII.\nDefendants also argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claim on the basis of governmental immunity. We disagree.\n\u201cA motion to dismiss should be granted when it appears that plaintiff is not entitled to any relief under any facts which could be presented in support of his claim.\u201d Harwood v. Johnson, 326 N.C. 231, 239, 388 S.E.2d 439, 444 (1990). North Carolina courts have held that the defense of sovereign immunity can be both a matter of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and a matter of personal jurisdiction under 12(b)(2). See Battle Ridge Cos. v. N.C. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 161 N.C. App. 156, 157, 587 S.E.2d 426, 427 (2003). When reviewing a motion to dismiss, \u201ca trial court may consider and weigh matters outside the pleadings. However, if the trial court confines its evaluation to the pleadings, the court must accept as true the plaintiffs allegations and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d Department of Transp. v. Blue, 147 N.C. App. 596, 603, 556 S.E.2d 609, 617 (2001).\n\u201cUnder the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the State is immune from suit absent waiver of immunity. Under the doctrine of governmental immunity, a county is immune from suit for the negligence of its employees in the exercise of governmental functions absent waiver of immunity.\u201d Meyer v. Walls, 347 N.C. 97, 104, 489 S.E.2d 880, 884 (1997) (internal citations omitted). It is axiomatic that \u201c[a]bsent consent or waiver, the immunity provided by the doctrine is absolute and unqualified.\u201d Messick v. Catawba County, 110 N.C. App. 707, 714, 431 S.E.2d 489, 494 (1993).\nPursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 153A-435(a) (2011),\nA county may contract to insure itself and any of its officers, agents, or employees against liability for wrongful death or negligent or intentional damage to person or property . . . caused by an act or omission of the county or of any of its officers, agents, or employees when acting within the scope of their authority and the course of their employment.\nFurther, if a county waives its immunity under \u00a7 153A-435(a), any person \u201csustaining damages as a result of an act or omission of the county or any of its officers, agents, or employees, occurring in the exercise of a governmental function, may sue the county for recovery of damages.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 153A-435(b) (2011).\nIn the instant case, the trial court explicitly stated that it declined to consider materials beyond the pleadings at that stage. Thus, our review must also be based solely on the pleadings. In Plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, they specifically allege, inter alia, that Defendant Durham County has purchased insurance pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 153A-435 and thus had waived its immunity. Defendants point to the proffered affidavit of the County\u2019s Risk Manager, filed with their motion to dismiss, that contends that the County has not purchased insurance which would provide coverage for the claims included in this action. However, because the trial court declined to consider Defendants\u2019 affidavits so must we, and based only on the pleadings, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to survive a Rule 12 dismissal on the basis of governmental immunity. Thus, the trial court\u2019s order must be affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nJudges ERVIN and THIGPEN, JR. concur.\n. Although the trial court did not expressly deny Defendants\u2019 governmental immunity claim, it effectively did so by denying the motion which included that claim.\n. Defendants assert the defense under both 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(2) in their motion to dismiss.", "author": "BEASLEY, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["LINDA CAROL ROBINSON, and JOHN CHARLES ROBINSON, Plaintiffs v.

The agreement provided that its execution was not a prerequisite to decedent being admitted or remaining in the facility. Plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof to show that the agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable. The order of the trial court denying defendant\u2019s motion to compel arbitration is reversed.\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\nOn 17 July 2006, Nancy Jo Chapman Westmoreland, as attorney in fact for her father, James Robert Chapman (\u201cChapman\u201d), placed him in a nursing facility owned by High Point Healthcare, Inc. (\u201cdefendant\u201d).\nOn 18 July 2006, Westmoreland as her father\u2019s power of attorney was presented with several documents for her signature, one of which was an arbitration agreement (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d). The Arbitration Agreement was a separate agreement, labeled as such in bold lettering. It provided that any claims between the parties would be resolved by binding arbitration and that the parties waived their right to trial before a jury or judge. The agreement explicitly stated that execution of the Arbitration Agreement was not a condition to Chapman being admitted to or remaining in the facility. Westmoreland as power of attorney executed this document, and Chapman remained at the facility until his death on 12 September 2007.\nOn 15 September 2009, Westmoreland, acting as executor .of her father\u2019s estate (hereinafter referred to as \u201cplaintiff\u2019 when acting in this capacity) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Guilford County seeking monetary damages based upon allegations that Chapman\u2019s death was proximately caused by the negligence of defendant. On 16 October 2009, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint or stay the proceedings and compel arbitration.\nThe motion to compel arbitration was heard on 9 December 2009. On 14 April 2010, the trial court entered a written order denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or to compel arbitration, ruling that the Arbitration Agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.\nDefendant appeals.\nII. Interlocutory Appeal\nThe trial court\u2019s order is not a final disposition of this case and is an interlocutory order. See Veazey v. City of Durham, 231 N.C. 357, 362, 57 S.E.2d 377, 381 (1950). However, our courts have held that an order denying a motion to stay proceedings so that the dispute can be arbitrated affects a substantial right and is immediately appealable pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-27(d)(1) (2009). See Barnhouse v. Am. Express Fin. Advisors, Inc., 151 N.C. App. 507, 508, 566 S.E.2d 130, 131 (2002).\nIII. Arbitration Agreement\nIn its first argument, defendant contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the Arbitration Agreement was unconscionable. We agree. This issue is dispositive; therefore, we do not address defendant\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal.\nA. Standard of Review\nUnconscionability is a question of law that is reviewed de novo on appeal. Tillman v. Commercial Credit Loans, 362 N.C. 93, 101, 655 S.E.2d 362, 369 (2008) (plurality opinion). Under de novo review, we consider the matter anew and are free to substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. Blow v. DSM Pharm., Inc., 197 N.C. App. 586, 588, 678 S.E.2d 245, 248 (2009). The trial court\u2019s findings of fact that are supported by competent evidence are binding on appeal even if there is evidence to support findings to the contrary. Tillman, 362 N.C. at 100-01, 655 S.E.2d at 369. The labels \u201cfindings of fact\u201d and \u201cconclusions of law\u201d employed by the trial court in a written order do not determine the nature of our review. See Peters v. Pennington,__ N.C. App._,_, 707 S.E.2d 724, 735 (2011) (reviewing what was labeled as a \u201cconclusion of law\u201d as a finding of fact). If the trial court labels as a finding of fact what is in substance a conclusion of law, we review that \u201cfinding\u201d de novo. See id.\nB. Analysis\nThere is no issue as to whether the parties entered into the Arbitration Agreement. The trial court found as a fact that Westmoreland executed the Arbitration Agreement in her capacity as attorney in fact for her father. The trial court specifically rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument that as power of attorney, she had no authority to bind the estate to arbitrate a wrongful death claim. On appeal, plaintiff does not argue this as an alternative basis for upholding the ruling of the trial court pursuant to Rule 28(c) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Thus, this issue is not before us.\n\u201cNorth Carolina has a strong public policy favoring arbitration.\u201d Raper v. Oliver House, LLC, 180 N.C. App. 414, 419, 637 S.E.2d 551, 554 (2006) (quoting Red Springs Presbyterian Church v. Terminix Co., 119 N.C. App. 299, 303, 458 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1995)); cf. Tillman, 362 N.C. at 101, 655 S.E.2d at 369 (\u201cArbitration is favored in North Carolina.\u201d). As the Supreme Court of Alabama explained, \u201c[t]here is nothing inherently unfair or oppressive about arbitration clauses, and arbitration agreements are not in themselves unconscionable.\u201d Blue Cross Blue Shield of Ala. v. Rigas, 923 So. 2d 1077, 1086 (Ala. 2005) (citation omitted).\nA contract is unconscionable, and therefore unenforceable under equitable principles,\nonly when the inequality of the bargain is so manifest as to shock the judgment of a person of common sense, and where the terms are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them on the one hand, and no honest and fair person would accept them on the other.\nBrenner v. Little Red Sch. House Ltd., 302 N.C. 207, 213, 274 S.E.2d 206, 210 (1981), quoted with approval in Tillman, 362 N.C. at 101-02, 655 S.E.2d at 369. \u201cAn inquiry into unconscionability requires that a court \u2018consider all the facts and circumstances of a particular case,\u2019 and \u2018[i]f the provisions are then viewed as so one-sided that the contracting party is denied any opportunity for a meaningful choice, the contract should be found unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d Tillman, 362 N.C. at 102, 655 S.E.2d at 369 (alteration in original) (quoting Brenner, 302 N.C. at 213, 274 S.E.2d at 210).\nThe leading case in North Carolina on the unconscionability of arbitration agreements is Tillman v. Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. In that case, a plurality of three justices concurred in the decision of the Court, two justices concurred in the result only, and two justices dissented. See Kucan v. Advance Am., 190 N.C. App. 396, 404 n.1, 660 S.E.2d 98, 103 n.1 (2008) (explaining that the analysis of the three-justice Tillman opinion was \u201cof a plurality, not a majority\u201d). The plurality opinion stated that unconscionability was an affirmative defense and that the party asserting that defense has the burden of establishing that the agreement was unconscionable. Tillman, 362 N.C. at 102, 655 S.E.2d at 369. The plurality further stated that to establish unconscionability, a party must demonstrate both procedural, unconscionability and substantive unconscionability. Id. at 102, 655 S.E.2d at 370 (citing Martin v. Sheffer, 102 N.C. App 802, 805, 403 S.E.2d 555, 557 (1991); 1 James J. White & Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 4-7, at 315 (5th ed. 2006)). Under the plurality\u2019s rationale, both elements must be present, but a court may rule a contract is unconscionable \u201cwhen [the] contract presents pronounced substantive unfairness and a minimal degree of procedural unfairness, or vice versa.\u201d Id. at 103, 655 S.E.2d at 370.\nA majority of the Court held that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. Id. at 108, 655 S.E.2d at 373. The concurring opinion agreed that the contract was unconscionable, but opined that the determination of unconscionability should be based upon a totality of the circumstances test, as set forth in Brenner v. Little Red School House, Ltd. Tillman, 362 N.C. at 109, 655 S.E.2d at 374 (Edmunds, J., concurring). Notably, Tillman was the first case where a North Carolina appellate court found a contract to be unconscionable. Id. at 111-12, 655 S.E.2d at 375 (Newby, J., dissenting) (making this observation).\nBoth the plurality and the concurring opinions focused upon the same factors in reaching their decision that the arbitration agreement in Tillman was unconscionable. In order to cover all possible modes of analysis in this case, we will first analyze this case under the two-part test posited by the plurality. We will then consider the trial court\u2019s order under the totality of the circumstances test posited by the concurring opinion.\n1. Procedural Unconscionability\n\u201c[P]rocedural unconscionability involves \u2018bargaining naughtiness\u2019 in the form of unfair surprise, lack of meaningful choice, and an inequality of bargaining power.\u201d Id. at 102-03, 655 S.E.2d at 370 (plurality opinion) (citing Rite Color Chem. Co. v. Velvet Textile Co., 105 N.C. App. 14, 20, 411 S.E.2d 645, 648 (1992)). In Tillman, the Supreme Court plurality found procedural unconscionability based on five factors; (1) the plaintiffs were rushed through the loan closing: (2) the closing officer indicated where to sign; (3) there was no mention of the offending terms at the closing; (4) the defendants admitted they would have refused to make the loan rather than negotiate terms of the arbitration agreement; and (5) \u201cthe bargaining power between [the] defendants and [the] plaintiffs was unquestionably unequal in that [the] plaintiffs [were] relatively unsophisticated consumers contracting with corporate defendants who drafted the arbitration clause and included it as boilerplate language in all of their loan agreements.\u201d Id. at 103, 411 S.E.2d at 370. The instant case lacks several of the indicia of procedural unconscionability that were present in Tillman.\nAn imbalance in bargaining strength is one of many factors that must be considered to determine whether there is procedural unconscionability. See id. But bargaining inequality alone generally cannot establish procedural unconscionability. Otherwise, procedural unconscionability would exist in most contracts between corporations and consumers. There would nearly always be some degree of \u201cinequality of bargaining power.\u201d The trial court held that because plaintiff was an \u201cordinary consumer\u201d and defendant was a \u201csophisticated health care services provider\u201d that there existed a \u201cprima facie inequality of bargaining power.\u201d We note that, while this statement was contained in the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, this is a legal conclusion to which we accord no deference on appeal. See Pennington, _N.C. App. at_, 707 S.E.2d at 735.\nThis is not, and has never been the law in North Carolina. Whether there is bargaining inequality must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis; this inquiry turns on the specific facts of each case. The trial court erred in holding that plaintiff had established a prima facie case of bargaining inequality merely because an \u201cordinary consumer\u201d was negotiating with a \u201csophisticated health care services provider.\u201d\nThe balance of the trial court\u2019s findings pertaining to procedural unconscionability deal with the execution of the documents. The trial court found that Westmoreland acting as attorney-in-fact for her father was told that the documents had to be signed to accomplish the admission of Chapman to the facility; that there was no discussion of the Arbitration Agreement; that she had no independent understanding of arbitration; and that she would not have signed the document had she understood that she was giving up Chapman\u2019s right to a jury trial. The trial court acknowledged that based upon the provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, it was not true that the admission of Chapman to the facility was contingent upon execution of the Arbitration Agreement. Paragraph 8 of the Arbitration Agreement was in boldface and capital type, and reads as follows:\n8. Right To Consultation. The Resident understands that the Resident has the right to consult an attorney or his or [sic] her choice about this Arbitration Agreement and to receive and [sic] explanation or clarification from the Facility\u2019s admissions coordinator. The Resident is not required to sign this Arbitration Agreement in order to be admitted to or to remain in the Facility.\nBY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, THE RESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE RESIDENT HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ THIS AGREEMENT OR IT HAS BEEN READ TO THE RESIDENT AND THE RESIDENT UNDERSTANDS ITS CONTENTS.\nThis paragraph contains three essential provisions: (1) it advised plaintiff of her right to consult with an attorney about the Arbitration Agreement; (2) it advised her of the right to receive an explanation or clarification from the admissions coordinator; and (3) it provided that she was not required to sign the Arbitration Agreement for her father to be admitted to the facility. In North Carolina, parties to a contract have an affirmative duty to read and understand a written contract before they sign it. Breece v. Standard Oil Co. of N.J., 209 N.C. 527, 530, 184 S.E. 86, 88 (1936).\nIt has long been the law in North Carolina that \u201cthe law will not relieve one who can read and write from liability upon a written contract, upon the ground that he did not understand the purport of the writing, or that he has made an improvident contract, when he could inform himself and has not done so.\u201d Weaver v. St. Joseph of the Pines, Inc., 187 N.C. App. 198, 213, 652 S.E.2d 701, 712 (2007) (quoting Oliver House, 180 N.C. App. at 421, 637 S.E.2d at 555) (internal quotation marks omitted). In Weaver, the plaintiff asserted that a release was an unconscionable contract. In rejecting this argument, this Court relied upon the above-cited law. Id. Where the terms and conditions of an agreement are clear and unequivocal, and are further highlighted in bold and capital typeface, a party cannot come into court and complain that an agreement is unconscionable because she failed to read it. Further, where the agreement affirmatively advises a party to seek legal advice or to consult with the admissions coordinator if she has any questions, that party cannot now assert that the agreement was unconscionable because she did not understand its terms.\nPlaintiff failed to meet her burden of proving that the Arbitration Agreement was procedurally unconscionable. The trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the Arbitration Agreement was procedurally unconscionable. The factors cited in Tillman as supporting procedural unconscionability are not present in the instant case. The Arbitration Agreement specifically provided that the admission of the patient was not dependent upon execution of the agreement by Westmoreland as attomey-in-fact for Chapman. The circumstances surrounding the execution of the Arbitration Agreement do not excuse Westmoreland\u2019s apparent failure to read it.\nThis case is further distinguishable from Tillman on a number of grounds. In the instant case, the trial court did not find that plaintiff was rushed through the signing process. Defendants did not admit that they would have refused to admit plaintiff\u2019s father had she refused to sign the Arbitration Agreement. In fact, the plain language of the Arbitration Agreement supports a contrary finding. Moreover, Chapman had already been admitted to the facility at the time of execution of the Arbitration Agreement. In light of the differences between this case and Tillman, particularly the provisions clearly advising plaintiff of three distinct rights, including that admission to or remaining in the facility was not contingent upon execution of the Arbitration Agreement, we discern no procedural unconscionability in the execution of the Arbitration Agreement. The trial court erred in holding that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable due to bargaining naughtiness.\n2. Substantive Unconscionability\n\u201cSubstantive unconscionability... refers to harsh, one-sided, and oppressive contract terms.\u201d Tillman, 362 N.C. at 103, 655 S.E.2d at 370 (citing Rite Chem. Co., 105 N.C. App. at 20, 411 S.E.2d at 648-49).\nThe trial court based its conclusion of substantive unconscionability upon three factors: (1) the policy of the American Arbitration Association against arbitrating negligent health care claims under pre-dispute arbitration agreements; (2) the allocation of benefits and detriments; and (3) the cost-shifting provisions under the Arbitration Agreement. This analysis was in error.\na. The Policy of the American Arbitration Association Not to Arbitrate Certain Claims\nThe arbitration agreement provides:\n2. Proceeding. Any arbitration proceeding that takes place under this Arbitration Agreement shall follow the rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and any resulting decision shall be enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted where the Facility is located or as close to the Facility as practical. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted before one neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA. The parties agree to bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceeding.\nThe parties stipulated before the trial court that \u201cit was, and remains, the policy of the American Arbitration Association... not to arbitrate disputes between health care providers and health care recipients where, as here, the arbitration agreement was signed prior to the occurrence of the facts leading to the dispute . . . .\u201d\nThe trial court concluded that AAA \u201cdoes not consider predispute arbitration agreements to be an appropriate methodology or forum for dispute resolution between health care providers and recipients, thereby rendering performance of the agreement impossible.\u201d The trial court also found that this was a factor to be considered in determining whether the Arbitration Agreement was unconscionable.\nWe first must determine whether the AAA policy rendered performance of the Arbitration Agreement impossible. This issue was considered by the Supreme Court of Alabama in the case of Blue Cross Blue Shield v. Rigas. In that case, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff argued that AAA\u2019s Health Care Policy Statement of 2003 precluded AAA from arbitrating the case. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the trial court, holding that the health care policy only indicated that AAA would not accept administration of certain types of cases, but that it did not preclude arbitration of the claims by a non-AAA arbitrator. The plaintiff\u2019s arguments that AAA\u2019s policy statement meant that the claims were not subject to arbitration were specifically rejected by the court. Rigas, 923 So. 2d at 1092.\nWe hold the logic of the Rigas decision to be compelling. In the instant case, as was the case in Rigas, the Arbitration Agreement required that the rules of AAA be followed. In addition, the agreement provided that the arbitrator be selected \u201cin accordance with the rules of the AAA.\u201d The agreement did not provide that a AAA arbitrator must be used to conduct the arbitration. AAA\u2019s policy did not render the performance of the Arbitration Agreement impossible. It simply meant that the arbitration could not be conducted under the auspices of AAA.\nWe further note that the AAA policy statement is in direct conflict with North Carolina\u2019s strong public policy in favor of arbitration. See, e.g., Oliver House, 180 N.C. App. at 419, 637 S.E.2d at 554. It is the role of the courts of North Carolina to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable. The courts of North Carolina will not abdicate this decision to AAA.\nWe hold that the trial court erred in concluding that performance of the Arbitration Agreement was impossible due to the polices of AAA. We also hold that the trial court erred in concluding that the AAA policy statement \u2014 which conflicts with this State\u2019s public policy in favor of arbitration \u2014 weighed in favor of ruling that the Arbitration Agreement was substantively unconscionable.\nb. Mutuality of the Agreement\nThe trial court found that:\nWhile the arbitration agreement on its face is mutually agreed upon (i.e., as written, no claims are exempted from its scope and its terms are applicable to both parties), in practice, the arbitration agreement is unconscionably one-sided. The agreement requires Defendants to arbitrate \u201cclaim[s] for payment, nonpayment, or refund for services rendered to the Resident by the Facility.\u201d Given that Defendants received payment in full each month through Social Security receipts and insurance (including Medicaid), Defendants have, in reality, nothing of significance to arbitrate. On the other hand, Mr. Chapman is required to arbitrate \u201cviolations of any right granted to the Resident by law or by the Admission Agreement, breach of contract, fraud or misrepresentation, negligence, gross negligence, malpractice, or any other claim based on any departure from accepted standards of medical or health or safety whether sounding in tort or contract.\u201d As there are no significant claims that Defendant could pursue that would be subject to arbitration, while at the same time, virtually every conceivable claim of substance that Plaintiff could make is subject to arbitration, the arbitration agreement is excessively one-sided and the inequality of the bargain is so manifest as to shock the judgment of a person of common sense, such that no reasonable person would make them on the one hand, and no honest and fair person would accept them on the other. (Alteration in original.)\nThis finding attempted to bring this case under the substantive unconscionability analysis of Tillman based upon the agreement being one-sided. However, the agreement in the instant case bears little resemblance to that found in Tillman.\nIn Tillman, the arbitration agreement exempted from its operation \u201cforeclosure actions and actions in which the total damages, costs, and fees do not exceed $15,000.\u201d Tillman, 362 N.C. at 107, 655 S.E.2d at 372. The plurality opinion reasoned that \u201cthe exceptions appear to be designed far more for the benefit of [the] defendants than for [the] plaintiffs.\u201d Id. at 107, 655 S.E.2d at 373. The onesidedness of the agreement was a factor in the plurality\u2019s holding that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable. Id.\nThere is no such exclusion in the Arbitration Agreement at issue in the instant case. The trial court recognized this fact. However, the trial court sought to find a one-sided provision by concluding that the only possible claim that defendant could have against Chapman would be for payment for residing at the facility, and then determining that social security, Medicaid, and insurance paid these charges each month on behalf of Chapman.\nThis analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, after being admitted to the facility, Westmoreland, as attorney in fact, executed the Admission Agreement on behalf of Chapman. This agreement contained a number of provisions outlining the duties and responsibilities of Chapman, of which the payment of monthly fees was only one item. Second, any analysis of mutuality must be based upon the conditions existing at the time that the Arbitration Agreement was entered into, and not retroactively. See Weaver, 187 N.C. App. at 212, 652 S.E.2d at 712 (\u201cThe question of unconscionability is determined as of the date the contract was executed.\u201d).\nIt is clear, from the above-recited findings contained in the trial court\u2019s order, that the trial court viewed the one-sidedness of the Arbitration Agreement retroactively rather than at the time of its execution.\nWe hold that the Arbitration Agreement was not one-sided. The trial court erred in concluding to the contrary.\nc. Cost-shifting Provision of the Agreement\nThe trial court found that:\nThe agreement provides that each side bear their own costs associated with the arbitration and that the prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs actually incurred. These provisions, in particular the \u201closer pays\u201d provision, present unacceptable risks for a person of Plaintiff\u2019s limited financial means. The cost-shifting \u201closers\u201d pays\u201d provision alone would deter a claimant in her financial position from seeking to vindicate rights and renders the agreement substantively unconscionable.\nA review of the relevant provisions of the arbitration agreement reveals that this finding by the trial court is without factual or legal basis. The agreement contains two provisions pertaining to costs and attorney\u2019s fees. In paragraph 2, the agreement provides that: \u201c[t]he parties agree to bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings.\u201d In paragraph 3 of the agreement, it was agreed that: \u201c[t]he prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding or in any legal proceedings connected to the arbitration proceeding or this Arbitration Agreement shall be entitled to recover any reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs that are actually incurred as a result.\u201d\nThe portion of the Tillman plurality opinion dealing with prohibitively high arbitration costs is the centerpiece of its substantive unconscionability analysis. It focused upon the trial court\u2019s findings that the costs of arbitration, as compared to the actual amount in controversy, effectively precluded the plaintiffs from obtaining legal representation and pursuing their claims. The plurality stated, \u201c[T]he combination of the loser pays provision, the de novo appeal process, and the prohibition on joinder of claims and class actions creates a barrier to pursuing arbitration that is substantially greater than that present in the context of litigation.\u201d Tillman, 362 N.C. at 106, 655 S.E.2d at 372.\nIn the instant case, the trial court focused upon the cost-shifting provisions in isolation, rather than as part of a broader analysis focusing on whether the cumulative effects of various provisions in the agreement create a substantial barrier to a plaintiff pursuing his or her claims. Rather than focusing on the cost-shifting provision in isolation, the Tillman plurality, citing an opinion from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, focused upon the cost differential between litigation and arbitration: \u201c[I]n order to find unenforceability due to excessive costs, the cost differential between litigation and arbitration must be so great that it deters individuals from bringing claims under the arbitration clause.\u201d Id. at 105, 655 S.E.2d at 372 (citing Bradford v. Rockwell Semiconductor Sys., Inc., 238 F.3d 549, 556 (4th Cir. 2001)).\nIn Tillman, there were detailed findings of fact by the trial court that documented the average daily rate of AAA arbitrator compensation in North Carolina to be $1225. Id. at 98, 655 S.E.2d at 367. The trial court in Tillman also documented that the amount of the single-premium credit life and disability insurance premiums charged to the plaintiffs were $2064.75 and $4208.75, respectively, thus limiting the plaintiffs\u2019 prospective recoveries. Id. at 99, 655 S.E.2d at 368. Based upon these findings, the plurality opinion agreed with the conclusion of the trial court that it was \u201cunlikely that any attorneys would be willing to accept the risks attendant to pursuing [these] claims.\u201d Id.\nIn contrast, the order of the trial court in the instant case is devoid of any findings of fact as to the potential cost of arbitration as compared to litigation. Rather, we are left with the trial court\u2019s conclusory language that the cost-shifting \u201cprovision alone would deter a claimant in her financial position from seeking to vindicate rights and renders the agreement substantively unconscionable.\u201d Plaintiff failed to establish the difference in the cost of arbitration and the cost of litigating her claims in court. Thus, she has also failed to establish that there is a differential that is so great that it deterred her from bringing the claim in an arbitration proceeding.\nWe further note that there is a significant difference between the claim for wrongful death brought in the instant case and the claims of the plaintiff brought in Tillman based on single premium credit life and disability insurance with premiums less than $5000. In Tillman, the small amount of the claim compared to the costs of arbitration made it difficult to procure legal representation to prosecute the claims. In the instant case, the claim is for wrongful death, a substantial claim. The nature and size of the claim in the instant case is not a barrier to obtaining legal representation.\nThere is another significant distinction between this case and Tillman. In Tillman, the trial court found that due to their limited financial resources, the only way the plaintiffs would be able to prosecute their claims would be by entering into a contingency fee agreement. Id. at 105, 655 S.E.2d at 371. Because the damages sought by the plaintiffs were so low, under $4500 in each case, the trial court and the Supreme Court concluded it was unlikely that a lawyer would take the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on a contingency basis. See id. at 105, 655 S.E.2d at 371-72. Further, the plurality explained, \u201cThe likelihood that an attorney would take a case controlled by the arbitration clause at issue ... [was] even less because the arbitration clause prohibited] the joinder of claims and class actions. Id.\nIn the instant case, there are no such findings by the trial court. Because this is a wrongful death case, the barriers to representation found in Tillman are not present.\nd. Conclusion \u2014 Substantive Unconscionability\nWe hold that each of the grounds for substantive unconscionability found by the trial court are flawed. Plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof to establish substantive unconscionability. The order of the trial court was in error and must be reversed.\nIV. Balancing Test of Tillman Concurring Opinion\nWe have held that the trial court erred in concluding several factors supported findings of both procedural and substantive unconscionability under the analysis set forth in the Tillman plurality opinion. Because these findings were incorrect, the result will be the same if we apply the totality of the circumstances approach set forth in the concurring opinion. Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that the \u201cinequality of the bargain is so manifest as to shock the judgment of a person of common sense, and [that] the terms are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them on the one hand, and no honest and fair person would accept them on the other.\u201d Id. at 101-02, 655 S.E.2d at 369 (quoting Brenner, 302 N.C. at 213, 274 S.E.2d at 210).\nV. Conclusion\nIt is the public policy of North Carolina to favor arbitration. There is nothing inherently unconscionable about an arbitration agreement.\nPeople should be entitled to contract on their own terms without the indulgence of paternalism by courts in the alleviation of one side or another from the effects of a bad bargain. Also, they should be permitted to enter into contracts that actually may be unreasonable or which may lead to hardship on one side. It is only where it turns out that one side or the other is to be penalized by the enforcement of the terms of a contract so unconscionable that no decent, fairminded person would view the ensuing result without being possessed of a profound sense of injustice, that equity will deny the use of its good offices in the enforcement of such unconscionability.\nBlaylock Grading Co., LLP v. Smith, 189 N.C. App. 508, 511, 658 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2008) (quoting Gas House, Inc. v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 289 N.C. 175, 182, 221 S.E.2d 499, 504 (1976)), overruled on other grounds by State ex rel. Utilities Com\u2019n v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 307 N.C. 541, 299 S.E.2d 763 (1983).\nThere is no question that Westmoreland, as power of attorney for Chapman entered into the Arbitration Agreement. She now asks the courts to set aside that agreement because she would prefer to litigate her claim in the courts rather than through arbitration. The courts of this State will only set aside contractual agreements based upon unconscionability in a very rare case. Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of establishing procedural and substantive unconscionability.\nThe ruling of the trial court denying defendant\u2019s motion to compel arbitration is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for entry of an order directing the parties to submit this matter to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Arbitration Agreement.\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\nJudges CALABRIA and BEASLEY concur.\nRESIDENT AND FACILITY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT PLEASE mil) CAREFULLY\n.

Even if the prosecutor\u2019s questions were intended to focus the jury\u2019s attention on defendant\u2019s silence and lack of cooperation with law enforcement following his arrest, the error did not amount to plain error when defendant made the same inquiry on cross-examination.\n3.

We hold there was no error in defendant\u2019s drug trial. However, because trial counsel conceded defendant\u2019s guilt to the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia and the record is incomplete as to whether defendant consented to such a concession, we dismiss this issue without prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to file a motion for appropriate relief in the trial court.\nIn June 2008, defendant Michael King was indicted on charges of possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, selling cocaine, possession of drug paraphernalia, and attaining habitual felon status. The matter was brought on for trial before a jury on 8 September 2008.\nAt trial, the evidence presented showed that on 4 January 2008 at 1:00 a.m., two plain-clothed officers with the Asheville Police Department Drug Suppression Unit were driving in the area of the Lee Walker Heights Apartment complex, an area from which the department had received a number of complaints regarding drug activity. The officers were in an unmarked vehicle. Defendant approached the vehicle and one of the officers asked if he could purchase thirty dollars worth of \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d Defendant took the money, entered the apartment complex, and within five minutes returned and handed drugs to the officer. A marked police car, surveilling the transaction, then arrived and arrested defendant.\nDefendant was found guilty of possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, sale of cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Subsequently, defendant was found guilty of attaining habitual felon status. The trial court entered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict, sentencing defendant to thirty days for possession of drug paraphernalia, and consecutive sentences of 150 to 189 months for possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine and selling cocaine. Defendant appealed.\nAs an indigent person with appointed appellate counsel, defendant requested a transcript of the proceeding. A partial transcript was provided; however, sections were missing and deemed unrecoverable.\nOn appeal, defendant raises the following questions: (I) Whether defendant is entitled to a new trial because of the State\u2019s inability to provide a complete transcript of the proceedings; (II) whether the trial court committed plain error by allowing a witness to testify to defendant\u2019s refusal to make a statement; and (III) whether defendant was provided ineffective assistance of counsel.\n/\nDefendant argues that he is entitled to a new trial on all charges because the State has failed to provide him with a complete transcript of the proceedings. Defendant contends that he has attempted to reconstruct the missing portions of the transcript but to no avail. As a result, he is unable to procure meaningful appellate review and is entitled to a new trial. We agree, in part.\nUnder North Carolina General Statutes, section 7A-452,\n[i]n cases in which an indigent person has entered notice of appeal and appellate counsel has been appointed by the Office of Indigent Defense Services, the clerk of superior court shall make a copy of the complete trial division file in the case, make a copy of documentary exhibits upon request, and furnish those files and any requested documentary exhibits to the appointed attorney.\nN.C.

To prevail on such grounds, a party must demonstrate that the missing recorded evidence resulted in prejudice. [In re Clark, 159 N.C. App. 75, 80, 582 S.E.2d 657, 660 (2003)].

App. 647, 651, 634 S.E.2d 915, 918 (2006). \u201cWithout an adequate alternative, this Court must determine whether the incomplete nature of the transcript prevents the appellate court from conducting a meaningful appellate review, in which case a new trial would be warranted.\u201d Hobbs, 190 N.C. App. at 187, 660 S.E.2d at 171 (citation and quotations omitted).\nIn an attempt to reconstruct the missing portions of the transcript, defendant requested a statement of any detailed memory of what occurred at trial or detailed notes taken during the trial from the following court officers: Judge Beverly Beal, who presided over the trial; Buncombe County Clerk of Superior Court; the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the matter; defendant\u2019s public defender; and the Deputy Clerk of Court who was present during the trial. Specifically, defendant noted the following portions of the proceedings that were missing from the transcript:\n1) several answers given by the defendant during Judge Beal\u2019s colloquy with him regarding his decision not to testify; 2) several portions of both [the prosecutor\u2019s] and [defense counsel\u2019s] closing arguments; 3) the substantive jury instruction on the charge of selling cocaine in case number 08 CRS 50163; 4) the substantive jury instruction on the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia in case number 08 CRS 50164; 5) the concluding jury instructions regarding jury unanimity, the requirement that the judge be impartial, the juror\u2019s duty to recall all of the evidence, etc; 6) anything that occurred during jury delib erations and/or any questions that may have arisen during jury deliberations in the possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, selling cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia trial; 7) the return of the verdicts in the possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, selling cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia trial; and 8) the entire habitual felon trial, including opening statements, evidence, closing arguments, instructions, and jury deliberations.\nJudge Beal responded that his notes from the trial state \u201cDefendant does not wish to present evidence. I conducted a voir dire examination of Defendant on his decision not to testify\u201d and that \u201cthe verdicts on the underlying charges were announced at 4:14 p.m., and the verdicts were \u2018Guilty.\u2019 There was no motion to poll the jury. In the second phase of the trial evidence was presented. The jury was presented with three charges of Habitual Felon status, and all were returned \u2018Guilty.\u2019 \u201d With the exception of Judge Beal, no official had a detailed memory of the trial or notes on the proceedings.\nReviewing the record, we note that defendant does not contest the completeness and accuracy of the transcript with regard to the following portions of the trial: defendant\u2019s arraignment; defendant\u2019s motions for complete recordation and sequestration of witnesses; the State\u2019s motion to join the charges for trial; jury selection and impaneling; opening statements by the prosecution and defense counsel; the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses \u2014 direct and cross-examinations through the prosecution resting its case; the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, as well as, the trial court\u2019s ruling; the defense resting its case; a Rule 21 conference \u2014 discussing what instructions were to be provided the jury; the verdict in the Habitual Felon proceeding; the sentencing hearing; and the judgment.\nDefendant contends, however, that the transcript is incomplete with regard to significant portions of the trial proceedings, including some of defendant\u2019s answers during the trial court\u2019s colloquy regarding defendant\u2019s decision not to testify:\nCourt: [Defendant], do you understand as a defendant charged in a criminal case you are not required to testify. Do you understand that?\nDefendant: I do.\nCourt: Do you understand that if you do testify, or did decide to testify, that you would be subject to cross-examination by the district attorney?\nDefendant: I do.\nCourt: And do you understand that if you testify he can cross-examine you about prior convictions as well as other things involving this case? Do you understand that?\nDefendant: I do.\nCourt: Do you understand that, on the other hand, that if you felt like it was in your best interest to testify that you could testify in the case?\nDefendant: Yes.\nCourt: But that if you do not testify that I will instruct the jury that they\u2019re not to hold that against you; do you understand that?\nDefendant: Yes.\nCourt: Do you want to talk about it with your lawyer?\nDefendant: No.\nCourt: Do you understand that, again, you could if you wanted to, but I\u2019m not telling you to do so. I\u2019m just being sure you understand you could if you wanted to. Do you understand that?\nDefendant: Yes.\nCourt: But you\u2019ve made the decision not to testify; is that right?\nDefendant: (Answer not audible enough to transcribe.)\nCourt: All right.\nDefense counsel: . . . we have talked about it.\nDefendant: Well, we haven\u2019t talked about it today.\nCourt: Right. But you understand \u2014 and I would not want you to think \u201cI can\u2019t testify.\u201d You could if you wanted to.\nDefendant: I know.\nCourt: But you don\u2019t want to; is that right?\nDefendant: (Answer not audible enough to transcribe.)\nCourt: All right; all right. You can have a seat. And the Court will instruct 101.30 [effect of the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify].\nOn the record, the trial court\u2019s inquiry and defendant\u2019s responses regarding his decision not to testify is substantially complete. Therefore, this record will not support defendant\u2019s contention that meaningful review of this issue is precluded. Defendant cannot show prejudice from the inaudible responses.\nDefendant also contends that he is prejudiced on appeal by the transcript\u2019s failure to fully reflect the closing arguments of both the prosecutor and defense counsel.\nIn his closing argument, as reflected by relevant portions of the transcript, the prosecutor states that he will go through \u201cthe three charges that the defendant\u2019s facing and tell you what the elements are and show you how [the State has] proved [its] case beyond any reasonable doubt.\u201d The prosecutor first discusses the charge of selling a controlled substance \u2014 cocaine. The prosecutor discusses the individual elements of the offense and makes an argument as to how the facts should be applied to satisfy each element. There is no interruption in the transcript. Next, the prosecutor discusses the charge of possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine. The prosecutor avers that the State must prove \u201cdefendant knowingly possessed cocaine____\u201d The transcript then acknowledges a break in the recording. The transcript resumes with the prosecutor\u2019s statements \u201cSo those are the only two elements that the State has to prove is that he knowingly possessed it and that he intended to sell it. And we know that he possessed it because he had it in his hands, and we know he intended to sell it because he got the money, went, came back and sold him the cocaine.\u201d Last, the prosecutor discusses the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia.\nBecause the only omission reflected in the transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments relates to statements on the charge of possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine and because the prosecutor recaps his discussion of the elements of that offense in his argument explaining the application of the facts to the elements, we find that meaningful appellate review of this issue is not precluded. Therefore, defendant is not prejudiced by the omissions.\nAs to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, there is no indication that any portion of the transcript is missing; rather, in one sentence, defense counsel\u2019s words were not audible:\nYou know the officer said, \u201cWe don\u2019t find pagers anymore.\u201d Well, they didn\u2019t find that. They didn\u2019t find baggies. He didn\u2019t have drugs in his pocket ready to (not audible enough to transcribe.) He\u2019s not adealer. He is not a drug dealer. They didn\u2019t find any money. No money on the defendant. None. Especially not that twenty dollars they gave him.\u201d\nIt appears that defense counsel\u2019s words which were \u201cnot audible enough to transcribe\u201d amount to only a fragment of one sentence. This does not preclude meaningful appellate review.\nDefendant contends that he is prejudiced on appeal by the transcript\u2019s omission of the substantive jury instruction on the charges of selling cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia, as well as, the trial court\u2019s concluding instructions regarding jury unanimity, the judge\u2019s impartiality, the juror\u2019s duty to recall all of the evidence, etc., and anything that occurred during jury deliberations.\nIt does not appear that the transcript of the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury is incomplete. The transcript includes the trial court\u2019s instruction on the following: the jury has a duty to decide the facts from the evidence presented; defendant has entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d entitling him to a presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; and the jury is the sole judge of a witness\u2019s credibility, as well as, the weight to be given the evidence. The transcript reflects the trial court\u2019s instruction on the charge of possessing cocaine with intent to sell or deliver but indicates that the device recording the proceedings stopped. The transcript continues with the trial court addressing the jury which had already begun deliberations. Omitted are the instructions on the charges of selling cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia, and the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding jury unanimity, the judge\u2019s impartiality, the juror\u2019s duty to recall all of the evidence, etc. However, during the Rule 21 conference, which was recorded and appears in the record, the trial court discussed with the parties the instructions to be given to the jury. Specifically, the .court stated pattern jury instructions N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim. 101.05, the function of the jury; N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim. 101.10, the burden of proof and reasonable doubt; N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim. 101.15, credibility of witness; N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim. 101.20, weight of the evidence; N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim. 104.94, testimony of expert witness; N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim. 101.30, effect of the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify; N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim. 105.20, impeachment or corroboration by prior statement; and N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim. 104.05, circumstantial evidence. With regard to the charges of possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell or deliver and possession of drug paraphernalia, as well as, concluding instructions for the jury, the court stated to the parties the following:\nThen[,] possession of controlled substance with intent to sell or deliver, and the Court will instruct the jury on the elements first: The defendant knowingly possessed cocaine. Cocaine\u2019s a controlled substance. A person possesses cocaine when he is aware of its presence and has both the power and intent to control its disposition or use. Second, the defendant intended to sell or deliver it. I\u2019m just briefly stating it. And then the mandate on that, [N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim.] 260.21, sale of controlled substance. The defendant\u2019s been charged with selling it and the State must prove that beyond a reasonable doubt.\n[N.C.P.I. \u2014 Crim.] 260.95, possession or use of drug paraphernalia. I\u2019m just going to say \u201cpossession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d I\u2019m not going to use that phrase \u201cuse.\u201d First, he possessed the paraphernalia, and that describes what it is, and second, that he did this knowingly. And third, that the defendant did so with the intent to use the paraphernalia in order to consume a controlled substance which would be unlawful to possess, cocaine.\nNow, then, instructions on the \u2014 concluding instructions, 101.35 [concluding instructions \u2014 jury consider all evidence, judge not express opinion, unanimous verdict, selection of foreperson], with which you guys are familiar.\nThe trial court later asked if defendant requested any additional instructions. Defendant asked that the court give a \u201cfull instruction\u201d on reasonable doubt and also asked for an instruction on entrapment. The record includes a transcript of the recorded discussion and the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request for an entrapment instruction. We also note that Judge Beal did not remember \u201cany questions the jury may have asked or actions that [he] took in response to any questions or the giving of further instructions to the jury.\u201d\nBased on the forecast of the jury instructions and the lack of any indication that the instructions provided deviated from those proposed, the incompleteness of the record does not deny defendant meaningful appellate review.\nDefendant further contends that he is prejudiced on appeal by the transcript\u2019s omission of the return of the verdicts on the charges of possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, selling cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia trial.\nAs previously stated, where verbatim transcripts are unavailable, a reconstruction of the proceedings may be achieved by narration. Quick, 179 N.C. App. at, 651, 634 S.E.2d at 918. Here, Judge Beal\u2019s response to defendant\u2019s request for any notes or memory he had of the proceedings include the following:\nMy notes on the verdicts just record: \u201cVerdicts 4:14 Guilty, no motion to poll; second phase \u2014 evidence \u201cH-l H-2 H-3\u201d Guilty.\u201d That means to me that the verdicts on the underlying charges were announced at 4:14 p.m., and the verdicts were \u201cGuilty.\u201d There is no motion to poll the jury. In the second phase of the trial evidence was presented. The jury was presented with three charges of Habitual Felon status, and all were returned \u201cGuillty.\u201d [sic]\nNotwithstanding the lack of a transcript regarding the return of the verdicts on the charges of possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, selling cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia trial, Judge Beal\u2019s detailed reconstruction is sufficient for defendant to obtain meaningful appellate review of this issue.\nLast, defendant contends that the lack of a verbatim transcript in the second phase of the trial, for a determination of defendant\u2019s habitual felon status, including opening statements, evidence, closing arguments, instructions, and jury deliberations, precludes meaningful appellate review. We agree.\nThe almost complete lack of a transcript or adequate alternative narration of the habitual felon phase of the proceedings in the lower court precludes our ability to review defendant\u2019s contentions on the habitual felon hearing and precludes any meaningful appellate review. See Hobbs, 190 N.C. App. at 187, 660 S.E.2d at 171. Accordingly, we remand this matter for a new determination of defendant\u2019s habitual felon status and sentencing.\nII\nNext, defendant argues that the trial court committed plain error by allowing Officer Rice to testify that defendant refused to make a statement after being read his Miranda rights. We disagree.\n[T]he plain error rule ... is always to be applied cautiously and only in the exceptional case where, after reviewing the entire record, it can be said the claimed error is a fundamental error, something so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been done, or where [the error] is grave error which amounts to a denial of a fundamental right of the accused, or the error has resulted in a miscarriage of justice or in the denial to appellant of a fair trial or where the error is such as to seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings or where it can be fairly said the instructional mistake had a probable impact on the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was guilty.\nState v. Cummings, 361 N.C. 438, 470, 648 S.E.2d 788, 807 (2007) (citation omitted).\n[I]t is well established that a criminal defendant has a right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, and under Article I, Section 23 of the North Carolina Constitution. A defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent following his arrest may not be used to infer his guilt, and any comment by the prosecutor on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to silence is unconstitutional. \u201cA statement that may be interpreted as commenting on a defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent is improper if the jury would naturally and necessarily understand the statement to be a comment on the exercise of his right to silence.\u201d\nState v. Ezzell, 182 N.C. App. 417, 420, 642 S.E.2d 274, 278 (2007) (quoting State v. Ward, 354 N.C. 231, 266, 555 S.E.2d 251, 273 (2001) (alterations in original)); accord State v. Alexander, 337 N.C. 182, 446 S.E.2d 83 (1994) (holding that where the prosecutor\u2019s questions were \u201crelatively benign,\u201d the prosecutor made no attempt to emphasize the fact that defendant did not wish to speak after being read his rights, and evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was substantial, the officer\u2019s testimony did not amount to plain error).\nRegardless of these rules, it is axiomatic that \u201c[a] defendant is not prejudiced ... by error resulting from his own conduct.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(c) (2009); see also State v. Payne, 280 N.C. 170, 171, 185 S.E.2d 101, 102 (1971) (\u201cOrdinarily one who causes (or we think joins in causing) the court to commit error is not in a position to repudiate his action and assign it as ground for a new trial. The foregoing is not intended as any intimation the court committed error in this instance; but to point out the legal bar to the defendant's right to raise the question. Invited error is not ground for a new trial.\u201d (citations omitted)).\nHere, Officer Rice gave the following testimony on direct examination.\nQ So after you placed him under arrest what did you do?\nA Transported him to jail.\nQ Did the defendant make any statements?\nA He didn\u2019t make anything worthy of writing down. We always speak with \u2014 or typically I speak with the suspect, you know, try to get information from them like \u201cwhere did you buy drugs,\u201d \u201chow long have you been doing this.\u201d I usually give them an opportunity to help themselves out. By that, I mean helping us. Maybe move up a level and catch the person that supplied him with the drugs. Obviously he was uncooperative as there were no statements or notes taken by me from him.\nOfficer Rice was further questioned about the investigation on cross-examination.\nQ Did you do any further investigation after you arrested [defendant]?\nA Such as the statements I spoke about earlier?\nQ Yes.\nA As I said earlier, we try to do a brief investigation with them depending on how cooperative they are. I did speak with him \u2014 or I\u2019m sure I spoke with him. There was nothing worth .writing down. He did not make any written statement. I didn\u2019t take any notes from it. It didn\u2019t yield anything useful.\nWhile we do not believe the prosecutor\u2019s questions were intended to focus the jury\u2019s attention on defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation with law enforcement following his arrest, even elevating this inquiry to a condemnation of defendant\u2019s silence cannot amount to plain error when defendant made the same inquiry on cross examination. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1443(c); see also Payne, 280 N.C. at 171, 185 S.E.2d at 102. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s argument is overruled.\nIII\nLastly, defendant argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by admitting defendant\u2019s guilt to the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia during her closing argument without defendant\u2019s consent. We dismiss this argument.\nA defendant\u2019s right to plead \u201cnot guilty\u201d has been carefully guarded by the courts. When a defendant enters a plea of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d he preserves two fundamental rights. First, he preserves the right to a fair trial as provided by the Sixth Amendment. Second, he preserves the right to hold the government to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. A plea decision must be made exclusively by the defendant. \u201cA plea of guilty or no contest involves the waiver of various fundamental rights such as the privilege against self-incrimination, the right of confrontation and the right to trial by jury.\u201d State v. Sinclair, 301 N.C. 193, 197, 270 S.E.2d 418, 421 (1980). Because of the gravity of the consequences, a decision to plead guilty must be made knowingly and voluntarily by the defendant after full appraisal of the consequences. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1011 through \u00a7 15A-1026; State v. Sinclair, 301 N.C. 193, 270 S.E.2d 418 (1980).\nState v. Maready,_N.C. App._,_, 695 S.E.2d 771, 775 (2010) (quoting State v. Harbison, 315 N.C. 175, 180, 337 S.E.2d 504, 507 (1985)). In Harbison, our Supreme Court noted that \u2018ineffective assistance of counsel, per se in violation of the Sixth Amendment, has been established in every criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s counsel admits the defendant\u2019s guilt to the jury without the defendant\u2019s consent.\u2019 \u201d State v. Matthews, 358 N.C. 102, 106, 591 S.E.2d 535, 539 (2004) (quoting Harbison, 315 N.C. at 180, 337 S.E.2d at 507-08). Id. at 108-09, 591 S.E.2d at 540 (quoting Harbison, 315 N.C. at 180, 337 S.E.2d at 507).\nThe gravity of the consequences demands that the decision to plead guilty remain in the defendant\u2019s hands. When counsel admits his client\u2019s guilt without first obtaining the client\u2019s consent, the client\u2019s rights to a fair trial and to put the State to the burden of proof are completely swept away. The practical effect is the same as if counsel had entered a plea of guilty without the client\u2019s consent. Counsel in such situations denies the client\u2019s right to have the issue of guilt or innocence decided by a jury.\nHere, defendant\u2019s counsel stressed, during her closing argument, that defendant was not a drug dealer but rather a drug user. With regard to the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia, defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated \u201c[s]o he could get four months total for the drug paraphernalia. And finding him guilty of the drug paraphernalia I would agree is about as open and shut as we can get in this case, but finding him guilty of the selling, you don\u2019t have the seller.\u201d (emphasis added).\nThough clearly a strategic decision, such a statement concedes defendant\u2019s guilt to the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia. The incomplete record before us contains no indication that defendant\u2019s trial counsel obtained defendant\u2019s consent to concede his guilt to the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia or that an inquiry was made into the basis for the concession. Therefore, we dismiss this issue without prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to file a motion for appropriate relief requesting an evidentiary hearing on whether trial counsel admitted defendant\u2019s guilt to the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia without defendant\u2019s consent.

App. _, .__ S.E.2d __ (filed 20 December 2011) (No. COA11-677) (dismissing the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument without prejudice to file a motion for appropriate relief in the trial court where the record on appeal was unclear as to whether defendant consented to trial counsel\u2019s concession of guilt).\nNo error in part; new trial on habitual felon status; dismissed in part.\nJudges ELMORE and STEPHENS concur.", "author": "BRYANT, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

After careful consideration, we affirm.\nIn 1995, Robert Brent McKinney formed Procar, Inc., a company that was engaged in framing contracting and concrete work. In 2005, McKinney formed Procar II, Inc. (plaintiff). At this time, Procar, Inc. began performing primarily concrete work, and plaintiff performed primarily framing work. Both companies were owned entirely by McKinney, and McKinney served as the sole director and president of both Procar, Inc. and plaintiff. The two companies also shared 1) employees, 2) an office, 3) a mailing address, 4) a telephone number, 5) a fax number, and 6) an email address.\nFor many years, Procar, Inc. and plaintiff provided labor to Southeastern Material, Inc. (Southeastern). Betty Lambert (defendant Lambert) was the secretary and treasurer of Southeastern. Tony M. Dennis (defendant Dennis) was the president of Southeastern. In paying invoices to Procar, Inc. and to plaintiff, Southeastern made its checks payable to simply \u201cProcar.\u201d On 16 June 2008, defendants both signed a \u201cPersonal Guaranty Agreement\u201d (the agreement) obligating themselves to personally guarantee the indebtedness of Southeastern \u201cdue to and owing to Procar, Inc. and/or any of its divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates including interest and Attorney\u2019s Fees.\u201d At the time the agreement was executed, the amount owed by Southeastern to plaintiff was approximately $611,500.00. Plaintiff continued to extend credit to Southeastern after the agreement was executed.\nOn 30 December 2009, Southeastern filed for bankruptcy protection. On 5 February 2010, plaintiff filed a complaint seeking to recover from defendants $515,724.97, the total amount allegedly owed to plaintiff by Southeastern at the time of the bankruptcy filing. On 7 May 2010, defendants filed an answer and a motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). In that motion, defendants asserted in part that the agreement was not supported by adequate or sufficient consideration. On 15 October 2010, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, asserting that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact. On 23 November 2010, defendants filed their own motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56. On 23 December 2010, the trial court entered an order denying both parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment. On 26 January 2011, the case came on for trial. Following the trial, the trial court entered a judgment for involuntary dismissal. In that judgment the trial court concluded that there was no valid and enforceable contract between plaintiff and defendants because 1) there was no consideration for the agreement and 2) plaintiff was not a subsidiary, division, or affiliate of Procar, Inc., and therefore plaintiff could not seek to enforce the agreement. Plaintiff now appeals.\nPlaintiff first argues that it is an affiliate of Procar, Inc., and that it is entitled to enforce the agreement. We agree in part with plaintiff\u2019s argument.\nThis Court notes that what constitutes an \u201caffiliate\u201d appears to be an unsettled area of our law. Both parties in their briefs direct this Court\u2019s attention to cases from other jurisdictions. However, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines an \u201caffiliate\u201d as \u201ca corporation that is related to another corporation by shareholding or other means of control: a subsidiary, parent or sibling corporation.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, (8th ed. 2004).\nHere, McKinney was the sole owner, director, and president of both Procar, Inc. and plaintiff. He ran both companies from the same office, with the same telephone number, mailing address, fax number, and email address. He also staffed both companies with, the same employees, and he titled them with essentially the same name. Furthermore, he accepted checks payable simply to \u201cProcar\u201d as payment for work done by both Procar, Inc. and plaintiff. Based on these facts, we are persuaded to classify Procar, Inc. and plaintiff as sibling corporations. Thus, under the aforementioned definition, Procar, Inc. and plaintiff would be considered \u201caffiliates.\u201d\nHowever, whether plaintiff, as an affiliate of Procar, Inc., could enforce the agreement turns upon whether the underlying agreement itself was enforceable. Therefore, we will turn our attention to plaintiff\u2019s second argument, that the agreement was supported by adequate consideration, because it covered future extensions of credit.\nAs a general rule, \u201ca guaranty [agreement] executed independently of the main debt must be supported by independent consideration.\u201d International Harvester Credit Corp. v. Bowman, 69 N.C. App. 217, 221, 316 S.E.2d 619, 621 (1984) (citation omitted). However, in Gillespie v. De Witt, this Court held that \u201cwhen the guaranty which is separate from the original indebtedness covers future as well as existing indebtedness, there is consideration for the guaranty apart from the principle indebtedness which was previously in existence.\u201d 53 N.C. App. 252, 280 S.E.2d 736 (1981).\nHere, plaintiff sought payment for indebtedness incurred before the agreement was executed. The trial court found that the agreement did not apply to both existing and future debts of Southeastern, and therefore the agreement was not supported by adequate consideration. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the language of the agreement does not state \u201cnow due to and owing\u201d or \u201ccurrently due to and owing,\u201d and therefore it should be plainly interpreted as meaning \u201cwhenever due and owing.\u201d Based on this interpretation, plaintiff argues that the agreement applied to future extensions of credit. We disagree.\n\u201cWhen the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, effect must be given to its terms, and the court, under the guise of construction, cannot reject what the parties inserted or insert what the parties elected to omit.\u201d Taylor v. Gibbs, 268 N.C. 363, 365, 150 S.E.2d 506, 507 (1966) (quotations and citations omitted). In De Witt this Court held that a guaranty agreement applied to future extensions of credit when that agreement stated \u201cnow owing or due, or which may hereafter, from time to time, be owing or due, and howsoever heretofore or hereafter created or arising or evidenced 53 N.C. App. 252, 261, 280 S.E.2d 736, 742-43 (1981) (quotations omitted) (emphasis added).\nHere, the agreement makes no mention of any future obligations; it states simply \u201cdue to and owing.\u201d Furthermore, as plaintiff has correctly argued in its brief, this Court may not insert any terms into the agreement. Thus, we reject plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that the agreement should be interpreted as \u201cwhenever due to and owing.\u201d Without future language, the agreement falls short of the example evidenced in De Witt. Accordingly, we conclude that the agreement did not apply to future extensions of credit. Thus, the trial court correctly determined that the agreement was not supported by adequate consideration, and that the agreement is not enforceable between the parties.\nAffirmed.\nJudges BRYANT and ERVIN", "author": "ELMORE, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["PROCAR II, INC., Plaintiff v.

Williamson and LaDane Williamson (petitioners), as trustees of Odell Williamson and Virginia C. Williamson, filed a petition in superior court to resolve a boundary dispute. This dispute was with Long Leaf Pine, LLC, and Exum Family, LLC (respondents). On 19 July 2010, petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted on 23 December 2010. The trial court entered an amended judgment on 19 January 2011. Respondents appeal, alleging that the trial court erred in granting the motion because there was a triable issue of fact present. After careful consideration, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\nOn 27 June 1955, the George E. Brooks heirs conveyed to M.C. Gore by deed a parcel of land that comprised the eastern end of Sunset Beach. The eastern boundary of this tract was labeled the \u201cM.C. Gore line,\u201d which itself was tied to measurements originating at the western chimney of the George E. Brooks residence.\nIn 1963, the North Carolina General Assembly established the Town of Sunset Beach and used the M.C. Gore line to denote the eastern boundary line of the town.\nA year later, H.R. Hewett surveyed the property retained by the George E. Brooks heirs. This survey showed that the property contained lots labeled numbers 1 through 9, 1 being the easternmost lot and 9 being the westernmost. Lot 9 was bounded on the western side by the M.C. Gore line.\nIn December 1982, Bobby M. Long, a licensed North Carolina surveyor, surveyed the M.C. Gore line by reproducing the measurements described in the 1955 deed. Those original measurements originate from the western chimney of the George E. Brooks residence. Mr. Long was able to reproduce those measurements because the George E. Brooks residence was still in existence at that time.\nOn 29 December 1988, petitioners acquired Lot 9 of the George E. Brooks Heirs Subdivision. The deed that made this conveyance refers to the M.C. Gore line as shown on the 1964 H.R. Hewett survey map, on which the line serves as the western boundary of the property.\nIn March 1990, Bobby M. Long and Samuel T. Inman, who is also a licensed North Carolina surveyor, again surveyed the M.C. Gore line. The George E. Brooks residence was still in existence, so they based their measurements on its location and confirmed that it was in the same location of the line listed in the 1982 survey. The two surveyors confirmed the location of the M.C. Gore line again on two other occasions in July and August 2000.\nOn 26 October 2004, James R. Tompkins, R.L.S., surveyed Lot 10 of what would become the Palm Cove Subdivision. This plot of land is located to the immediate west of Lot 9. The survey showed the eastern boundary line of Lot 10 to be the M.C. Gore line.\nOn 10 May 2005, Respondent Exum Family, LLC, acquired Lot 10. This deed stated that the land being conveyed was \u201cLot 10 as shown on a survey map by James R. Tompkins[.]\u201d\nOn 2 September 2008, respondent Long Leaf Pine, LLC, acquired by non-warranty deed from Sunset Beach & Twin Lakes, Inc., an area of land lying to the east of the M.C. Gore line, beyond the western border of petitioners\u2019 property.\nThe land which respondent Long Leaf Pine, LLC, acquired in 2008 is on the eastern side of the M.C. Gore line, an area that petitioners contend they own. As a result, on 17 October 2009, petitioners filed this proceeding to establish a true boundary line. On 19 July 2010, petitioners filed a summary judgment motion. Respondents opposed this motion and provided an affidavit from Jack Stocks, a licensed North Carolina surveyor. In his affidavit, Mr. Stocks stated his belief that the M.C. Gore line had been incorrectly platted based on his examination of the surveys listed above. He did not perform a survey of the area.\nOn 19 January 2011, in its amended judgment, the trial court granted petitioners\u2019 motion because there were no genuine issues of material fact present in the pleadings, affidavits, arguments of counsel and memoranda of law of the parties. Respondents now appeal.\n\u201cOn appeal, an order allowing summary judgment is reviewed de novo.\u201d Tiber Holding Corp. v. DiLoreto, 170 N.C. App. 662, 665, 613 S.E.2d 346, 349 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen considering a motion for summary judgment, the trial judge must view the presented evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001) (citation omitted). \u201cAll inferences of fact must be drawn against the movant and in favor of the nonmovant.\u201d Roumillat v. Simplistic Enterprises, Inc., 331 N.C. 57, 63, 414 S.E.2d 339, 342 (1992) (citation omitted). The granting of a motion for summary judgment is proper when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2011).\n\u201cThe moving party bears the initial burden of coming forward with a forecast of evidence tending to establish that no triable issue of material fact exists.\u201d Briley v. Farabow, 348 N.C. 537, 543, 501 S.E.2d 649, 653 (1998) (citation omitted).\nThe movant may meet this burden by proving that an essential element of the opposing party\u2019s claim is nonexistent, or by showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his claim or cannot surmount an affirmative defense which would bar the claim.\nCollingwood v. G.E. Real Estate Equities, 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989) (citations omitted). \u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(e) (2011). \u201c[A]n issue is genuine if it is supported by substantial evidence, which is that amount of relevant evidence necessary to persuade a reasonable mind to accept a conclusion.\u201d Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002) (quotations and citations omitted). It means \u201cmore than a scintilla or a permissible inference.\u201d DeWitt v. Eveready Battery Co., 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002) (quotations and citation omitted).\nRespondents argue that the trial court erred by granting petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment because a genuine issue of fact existed as to the location of the boundary line. Respondents argue that the map and accompanying affidavit prepared by their expert is evidence that is substantial enough to prove that a triable issue of fact exists. We disagree.\nAs the moving party, petitioners bear the initial burden of establishing that no triable issue of material fact exists. They offered a large amount of evidence in support of their position sufficient to satisfy their burden.\nPetitioners presented the 1955 deed that created the disputed M.C. Gore line. This deed contained a description of the line and where it lay, and it listed the measurements necessary to find the location of the line using the chimney of the George E. Brooks residence as a reference point. Petitioners submitted evidence illustrating that the M.C. Gore line was used by the North Carolina General Assembly to mark the eastern boundary of the Town of Sunset Beach when it incorporated the town in 1963. Petitioners submitted a 1964 survey done by H.R. Hewett for the George E. Brooks heirs showing the M.C. Gore line to be the western boundary line of the Brooks property. Petitioners submitted a 1982 survey done by Bobby M. Long in which Mr. Long found the M.C. Gore line to be fixed in the same location stated in the 1955 deed and 1964 survey. Petitioners submitted evidence of three other surveys done in March 1990, July 2000, and August 2000, all of which found the M.C. Gore line to be in the same location.\nThe evidence submitted by petitioners established that the M.C. Gore line is a well documented boundary line that has been in use for half a century. Petitioners, therefore, provided adequate evidence to shift the burden onto respondents, who had to prove the existence of a genuine issue of fact through substantial evidence.\nThe only evidence respondents have produced is an affidavit and map prepared by their expert, Jack Stocks. In these documents, Mr. Stocks explained how he analyzed the prior surveys done by petitioners\u2019 experts, Mr. Long and Mr. Inman, and concluded from his inspection of those documents that the M.C. Gore line has been inaccurately located. Mr. Stocks, though a licensed North Carolina surveyor, did not perform his own survey of the disputed area. Instead, he based his conclusions solely on an examination of the evidence provided by petitioners.\nRespondents believe that this evidence is sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of fact and cite English v. Holden Beach Realty Corp., 41 N.C. App. 1, 254 S.E.2d 223 (1979), in support of this position. English involved a similar boundary dispute between several landowners and a road developer who was constructing a road on land the owners claimed was theirs. Id. at 2, 254 S.E.2d at 227. The trial court granted the owners\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, and the developer appealed. Id. at 3, 254 S.E.2d at 228. The owners produced affidavits from two surveyors and who had surveyed the land in question in support of their position, while the developer produced an affidavit from a competing expert who had surveyed the land and had also examined the surveys done by the owners\u2019 experts. Id. at 4, 254 S.E.2d at 227-28. This Court held that the affidavit prepared by the developer\u2019s expert was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact. Id. at 11, 254 S.E.2d at 232.\nRespondents argue that English stands for the idea that a genuine issue of fact can be raised in a boundary dispute through the opinion of an expert who has done nothing but review the maps prepared by other surveyors. We decline to accept respondents\u2019 interpretation, as English cannot be read to support such an argument and is distinguishable from the case at bar. The expert in English did not base his opinion solely on an examination of the surveys prepared by others; he performed his own survey of the land in question. Id. at 11, 254 S.E.2d at 232. Here, respondents\u2019 expert has not performed a survey of his own and he has based his conclusions solely on an examination of documents prepared by others.\nThe affidavit prepared by respondents\u2019 expert is not substantial evidence that would persuade a person of reasonable mind to accept that the M.C. Gore line was improperly located. Petitioners have put forward a sizeable amount of evidence speaking to the long recognized location of the M.C. Gore line. The line has been used as a boundary by several independent parties, including the State of North Carolina. The line has been surveyed on multiple occasions and found to lie in the same location in each survey.\nRespondents must provide substantial evidence in favor of the existence of a material fact that amounts to \u201cmore than a scintilla or permissible inference,\u201d DeWitt, 355 N.C. at 681, 565 S.E.2d at 146 (quotations and citation omitted), and the trial court properly concluded that Mr. Stocks\u2019s affidavit was not such substantial evidence.\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court properly granted petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nAffirmed.\nJudges BRYANT and STEPHENS concur.", "author": "ELMORE, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["ODELL DeCAROL WILLIAMSON and LaDANE WILLIAMSON, formerly LaDane Bullington, as Trustees under instrument Dated December 29, 1988 with ODELL WILLIAMSON and VIRGINIA COX WILLIAMSON, as Grantors, Petitioners v.

Background\nOn the evening of 19 November 2009, Officer Brett Gant (\u201cOfficer Gant\u201d) of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department was working with a confidential informant to set up potential drug deals with multiple individuals, including defendant. Defendant subsequently contacted the informant by telephone and agreed to meet the informant for the exchange of a small amount of cocaine at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant on Beatties Ford Road in Charlotte, North Carolina. Officer Gant and the informant drove in an unmarked vehicle to a parking lot across the street from the McDonald\u2019s restaurant, where the informant identified defendant\u2019s vehicle in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot approximately 100 feet away. When the informant did not show up to complete the deal, defendant left the McDonald\u2019s parking lot. Officer Gant proceeded to follow defendant headed inbound on Beatties Ford Road and relayed to fellow Officer Daniel Bignall (\u201cOfficer Bignall\u201d) that \u201c[t]here was going to be a subject in a silver Kia with crack cocaine in the Beatties Ford Road corridor.\u201d\nOfficer Bignall was approximately four miles away from the McDonald\u2019s restaurant when he received the tip from Officer Gant. Officer Eric Mickley (\u201cOfficer Mickley\u201d) was riding with Officer Bignall at the time. Officer Bignall drove in the direction of Beatties Ford Road and observed a vehicle matching Officer Gant\u2019s description. Officer Gant approximated the vehicle was travelling at 45 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone. Accordingly, Officer Bignall activated his patrol lights and stopped the vehicle, in which defendant was the driver.\nUpon approaching defendant\u2019s vehicle, Officer Bignall informed defendant he was speeding \u201c40, 45\u201d miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone and asked defendant for his driver\u2019s license and registration. Defendant responded that he did not have a driver\u2019s license, but he produced a North Carolina identification card. Officer Bignall then asked defendant to step out of the vehicle, placed defendant in handcuffs, and stated to defendant that he was not under arrest. After checking defendant\u2019s information, Officer Bignall discovered defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been permanently suspended. Defendant was placed under arrest for driving while license revoked. Officer Bignall asked defendant for permission to search the vehicle, to which defendant responded, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d Officer Mickley conducted the search of defendant\u2019s vehicle and recovered a small amount of marijuana in an ashtray.\nBelieving defendant had drugs on his person, Officer Bignall proceeded to conduct a search of defendant\u2019s person. Officer Bignall asked defendant to remove his socks and shoes, and Officer Bignall proceeded to search defendant\u2019s pockets and waistband area. Officer Bignall then undid defendant\u2019s belt and looked down into defendant\u2019s pants while asking defendant to sway back and forth in an attempt to \u201cloosen up anything that may have been hidden on his person.\u201d Officer Bignall stated he believed defendant was carrying drugs on his person because of the information relayed by Officer Gant and because there were signs of marijuana use in defendant\u2019s vehicle but there was no plastic bag in the vehicle in which the marijuana would have been packaged.\nOfficer Bignall then told defendant he would need to conduct a second, more thorough search of defendant\u2019s person. Officer Bignall placed defendant in the backseat of his police vehicle and drove defendant to \u201cthe back side\u201d of a school parking lot \u201cbehind or near a loading dock, so [they] were shielded by the loading dock, a fence, and [the] police vehicle.\u201d Officer Mickley secured defendant while Officer Bignall conducted the search. Officer Bignall dropped defendant\u2019s pants down and searched defendant\u2019s boxer briefs with his hand. Both Officer Bignall and Officer Mickley testified that defendant\u2019s underwear was not removed during the search. During the search, Officer Bignall discovered an object containing three grams of crack cocaine in the \u201ckangaroo pouch\u201d of defendant\u2019s boxer briefs, or the \u201cfly area . . . where the two pieces of fabric overlap.\u201d The entirety of the vehicle stop was recorded by audio-video equipment on Officer Bignall\u2019s patrol vehicle.\nOn 8 March 2010, defendant was indicted for possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine based on the events of 19 November 2009. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence found on his person, arguing that no probable cause or exigent circumstances existed to warrant a public \u201cstrip search.\u201d On 19 April 2011, the trial court conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, during which Officers Gant, Bignall, and Mickley testified to the foregoing events. Defendant also testified in his own defense, stating the officers had removed not only his pants, but also his underwear, leaving his private parts exposed to view by other people. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress in open court on the following morning, 20 April 2011, and thereafter entered a written order denying the motion, concluding the searches of defendant\u2019s person were conducted incident to defendant\u2019s arrest and were reasonable.\nThe following day, on 21 April 2011, defendant decided to plead guilty to possession of cocaine while reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. The trial court accepted defendant\u2019s plea and sentenced defendant to seven to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant timely appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to this Court by written notice on 2 May 2011.\nII. Standard of Review\nThe scope of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying a motion to suppress evidence \u201cis strictly limited to determining whether the trial judge\u2019s underlying findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, in which event they are conclusively binding on appeal, and whether those factual findings in turn support the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions of law.\u201d State v. Cooke, 306 N.C. 132, 134, 291 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1982).\nIndeed, an appellate court accords great deference to the trial court in this respect because it is entrusted with the duty to hear testimony, weigh and resolve any conflicts in the evidence, find the facts, and, then based upon those findings, render a legal decision, in the first instance, as to whether or not a constitutional violation of some kind has occurred.\nId. at 134, 291 S.E.2d at 619-20.\nIf the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, they are conclusive on appeal. State v. Barnard, 184 N.C. App. 25, 28, 645 S.E.2d 780, 783 (2007), aff\u2019d, 362 N.C. 244, 658 S.E.2d 643 (2008). \u201cWhile the trial court\u2019s factual findings are binding if sustained by the evidence, the court\u2019s conclusions based thereon are reviewable de novo on appeal.\u201d State v. Parker, 137 N.C. App. 590, 594, 530 S.E.2d 297, 300 (2000).\nIII. Discussion\nOn appeal, defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of his person because the search the officers performed was an unreasonable and intrusive public \u201cstrip search\u201d that violated his constitutional rights. We disagree.\n\u201cThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1 \u00a7 20 of the North Carolina Constitution preclude only those intrusions into the privacy of the body which are unreasonable under the circumstances.\u201d State v. Johnson, 143 N.C. App. 307, 312, 547 S.E.2d 445, 449 (2001). In determining whether an officer\u2019s conduct was reasonable in executing a search of the defendant\u2019s person, the trial court must balance \u201c \u2018the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447, 481 (1979)). \u201c \u2018Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 481).\nIn Battle, 202 N.C. App. 376, 688 S.E.2d 805, this Court emphasized that \u201c \u2018 \u201cdeeply imbedded in our culture ... is the belief that people have a reasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed unclothed or to have their \u2018private\u2019 parts observed or touched by others.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 384, 688 S.E.2d at 813 (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Stone, 362 N.C. 50, 55, 653 S.E.2d 414, 418 (2007) (quoting Justice v. City of Peachtree, 961 F.2d 188, 191 (11th Cir. 1992))). Accordingly, in Battle, we noted that \u201c[a] valid search incident to arrest. . . will not normally permit a law enforcement officer to conduct a roadside strip search.\u201d Id. at 387-88, 688 S.E.2d at 815. Rather, \u201c[i]n order for a roadside strip search to pass constitutional muster, there must be both probable cause and exigent circumstances that show some significant government or public interest would be endangered were the police to wait until they could conduct the search in a more discreet location \u2014 usually at a private location within a police facility.\u201d Id. at 388, 688 S.E.2d at 815.\nA. Strip Searches\nWe first address the State\u2019s contention that the requirements enunciated in Battle do not apply to the present case because the searches conducted of defendant\u2019s person did not rise to the level of \u201cstrip searches.\u201d As to this issue, the trial court made the following pertinent findings of fact:\n9. After the initial searches of defendant\u2019s person and vehicle did not produce the expected cocaine, Officer Bignall took the defendant back to the side of his patrol car, which was still parked on the side of Beatties Ford Road, to conduct a more thorough search of his person. Bignall placed the defend-ant between two open doors of the patrol car and unbuckled defendant\u2019s belt and loosened his trousers. He then pulled out the waistband of the pants and looked inside, telling the defendant to sway back and forth as he did so. This search was done on the roadside, as other vehicles were passing. . . . [T]he officers did not pull down defendant\u2019s pants or expose his private parts to any other person or to passing motorists. . . . This second search of defendant\u2019s person likewise produced no contraband.\n10. At this point, Officer Bignall placed defendant in the back of his patrol car and did further investigation into his prior criminal record. . . . After finding a number of prior convictions, Bignall advised the defendant that he would be taken to jail for driving while license revoked. At this point it was clear that defendant was under arrest. Bignall then told defendant that he was going to do a \u201creally good search.\u201d\n11. [Officer Bignall] then drove his patrol car to the rear of the school parking lot, away from the roadway and passing motorists on Beatties Ford Road, when he conducted a third search of the defendant\u2019s person.\n12. At the back of the parking lot, Bignall removed defendant from the patrol car, still handcuffed, and conducted a more extensive search of the defendant. During this search, Officer Bignall again unbuckled defendant\u2019s belt, loosened his trousers, and this time pulled down his pants. He then patted down defendant\u2019s groin, buttocks and private areas. . . . [T]he officer did not pull down defendant\u2019s underwear or otherwise expose his bare buttocks or genitals. . . . This third search, the most intrusive of the searches of defendant\u2019s person, was done in the back of a school parking lot, away from the public road and out of the view of passing motorists.\nFrom these findings of fact, we conclude the searches of defendant\u2019s person constituted strip searches. During both searches, defendant\u2019s private areas were observed by Officer Bignall. In addition, during the third search, in which the contraband was found on defendant\u2019s person, defendant\u2019s pants were removed, leaving defendant in his underwear, and Officer Bignall searched inside of defendant\u2019s underwear with his hand. Moreover, in Finding of Fact number 16, the trial court expressly indicated the third search was \u201csomething in the nature of a \u2018strip search.\u2019 \u201d Given the heightened privacy interests in one\u2019s \u201cintimate areas,\u201d see Stone, 362 N.C. at 55, 653 S.E.2d at 418, we hold the second and third searches of defendant\u2019s person can properly be considered \u201c[s] ear ches akin to strip searches.\u201d State v. Smith, 118 N.C. App. 106, 117, 454 S.E.2d 680, 687 (1995) (Walker, J., dissenting), reversed per curiam on grounds stated in dissenting opinion, 342 N.C. 407, 464 S.E.2d 45 (1995). Thus, the requirements of probable cause and exigent circumstances must be established to justify the strip searches of defendant in the present case, as enunciated in Battle.\nB. Probable Cause\nDefendant\u2019s first argument on appeal is that no probable cause existed to warrant the roadside strip searches of his person. Probable cause is \u201ca suspicion produced by such facts as indicate a fair probability that the person seized has engaged in or is engaged in criminal activity.\u201d State v. Schiffer, 132 N.C. App. 22, 26, 510 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1999). \u201cThe substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, and . . . the belief of guilt must be particularized with respect to the person to be searched or seized[.]\u201d Battle, 202 N.C. App. at 388, 688 S.E.2d at 815 (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nWhen probable cause is based on an informant\u2019s tip a totality of the circumstances test is used to weigh the reliability or unreliability of the informant. Several factors are used to assess reliability including: \u201c(1) whether the informant was known or anonymous, (2) the informant\u2019s history of reliability, and (3) whether information provided by the informant could be and was independently corroborated by the police.\u201d\nState v. Green, 194 N.C. App. 623, 627, 670 S.E.2d 635, 638 (quoting State v. Collins, 160 N.C. App. 310, 315, 585 S.E.2d 481, 485 (2003)), aff'd, 363 N.C. 620, 683 S.E.2d 208 (2009).\nHere, regarding probable cause to further search defendant\u2019s person, the trial court found as fact that \u201cOfficer Bignall persisted in conducting an extensive search of defendant\u2019s person due to the fact that he had received information from Officer Gant and his informant that defendant would be traveling on Beatties Ford Road in a silver Kia, carrying 3 grams of crack cocaine. His initial search[] of the vehicle and the defendant had not produced this cocaine.\u201d\nDefendant argues the trial court\u2019s finding on probable cause is erroneous because the information provided by the confidential informant was vague, lacked sufficient specificity, and lacked sufficient reliability to provide legal justification for the extensive search of his person. Specifically, defendant contends there is no competent evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of fact that \u201c[tjhe informant . . . told [Officer] Gant that defendant would be arriving in a silver Kia[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defendant contends the evidence indicates only that the informant told the officer that defendant would be travelling in a \u201csilver vehicle\" to and from the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, which is broad enough to apply to many cars in the vicinity. (Emphasis added.) In addition, defendant contends the informant did not provide any other identifying information or description of defendant, nor did the informant identify any quantity of drugs that defendant would be carrying or state that defendant would be carrying drugs on his person. Defendant further contends the informant\u2019s information was not sufficiently reliable to provide legal justification for a search of his person because the officers did not corroborate any of the informant\u2019s information.\nAt the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, Officer Gant testified that the confidential informant involved in this case was not only known to him, but also to another detective at the police department who had used the informant on a prior occasion. Officer Gant testified that the informant was a paid informant registered with the police department\u2019s Vice and Narcotics Division and that information from the informant had led to the arrest of at least six other individuals during the week prior to the arrest of defendant. Officer Gant testified that the informant had contacted a specific telephone number to set up a drug deal, and that individual had returned the informant\u2019s call to set up the deal for a, \u201csmall amount of cocaine\u201d at the McDonald\u2019s restaurant on Beatties Ford Road. Officer Gant testified that the informant was in Officer Gant\u2019s vehicle when the informant both made and received the phone calls. Officer Gant testified that immediately after the phone calls, the informant travelled with Officer Gant to a parking lot approximately 100 feet away from the McDonald\u2019s restaurant, where the informant identified defendant\u2019s vehicle as the individual who \u201cshowed up based on the phone call.\u201d Officer Gant testified that he actually saw defendant in the vehicle identified by the informant. Officer Gant testified that when defendant left the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, Officer Gant actually followed defendant onto Beatties Ford Road while providing a description of defendant\u2019s vehicle to Officer Bignall. Although Officer Gant could not remember the exact description given of defendant\u2019s vehicle, Officer Bignall testified twice that he received information from Officer Gant that \u201c[t]here was going to be a subject in a silver Kia with crack cocaine in the Beatties Ford Road corridor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Officer Bignall further testified that \u201c[i]t was less than a minute\u201d between the time he received the call from Officer Gant and the time he observed defendant\u2019s vehicle and that defendant\u2019s vehicle was \u201cthe only silver vehicle on Beatties Ford Road at that time going inbound.\u201d\nAfter stopping defendant\u2019s vehicle, defendant consented to a search of his vehicle, in which a small amount of marijuana was found, but no cocaine. Accordingly, there is competent evidence in the record to show that the informant, who was known to the officers and who had provided reliable information in the past, provided sufficient reliable information, corroborated by Officer Gant, to establish probable cause to believe that defendant would be carrying a small amount of cocaine in his vehicle. When the consensual search of defendant\u2019s vehicle did not produce the cocaine, the officers had sufficient probable cause, under the totality of the circumstances, to believe that defendant was hiding the drugs on his person. Thus, defendant\u2019s arguments that the officers lacked probable cause to conduct a more extensive search of his person are without merit.\nC. Exigent Circumstances\nRegarding exigent circumstances warranting the roadside strip search of defendant, the trial court made the following finding of fact:\n[Officer Bignall] knew that the defendant had experience with the intake procedures at the Mecklenburg County Jail, including search policies. He also reasonably could anticipate that defendant, even though handcuffed, would do anything possible to dispose of any contraband on his person prior to undergoing extensive (including \u201cstrip\u201d) search procedures at the jail. These circumstances constituted exigent circumstances that justified the extensive and intrusive nature of the third search of the defendant.\nDefendant argues the State presented no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that exigent circumstances existed to justify the intrusive search of his person. Defendant points out that less intrusive means of searching his person were readily available to the officers.\nHowever, although defendant argues no testimony was presented supporting a finding of exigent circumstances, the trial court\u2019s finding is nonetheless supported by the transcript of the audio-video recording produced from Officer Bignall\u2019s police vehicle, which was admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing. The transcript reveals multiple conversations between Officer Bignall and defendant regarding defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, which included felony drug offenses, prior to the strip search of defendant in the school parking lot. Further, the transcript reveals defendant\u2019s constant begging and pleading with Officer Bignall not to take defendant to jail. This is competent evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding of fact that Officer Bignall knew defendant had prior experience with intake procedures at the jail and that he could reasonably expect that defendant would attempt to rid himself of any evidence in order to prevent his going to jail.\nIn addition, although defendant points out that testimony was presented that a police station was located just down the street from the location of the stop on Beatties Ford Road, there is no evidence in the record indicating that this particular police station was open and operating at the time of defendant\u2019s stop, which was approximately 11:00 p.m. at night, or that the officers would be able to conduct a more private search at that location. Moreover, this Court has previously noted that \u201c\u2019[t]he reasonableness of any particular governmental activity does not necessarily or invariably turn on the existence of alternative \u201cless intrusive\u201d means.\u2019 \u201d Battle, 202 N.C. App. at 393, 688 S.E.2d at 818 (quoting Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 647, 77 L. Ed. 2d 65, 72 (1983)). Thus, defendant\u2019s arguments that no exigent circumstances existed to justify the search of his person are likewise without merit.\nD. Reasonableness of the Search\nHaving concluded the requirements set forth in Battle for conducting a roadside strip search \u2014 probable cause and exigent circumstances \u2014 were properly found by the trial court, we summarily address the reasonableness of the search of defendant\u2019s person conducted by the officers. Notably, the trial court found as fact that the third most intrusive search of defendant\u2019s person, during which the drugs were found in his boxer briefs, \u201ctook place at night, in a dark area, away from the traveled roadway, with no other people in the immediate vicinity other than defendant and the officers.\u201d Further, the trial court found as fact that \u201cthe officer did not pull down defendant\u2019s underwear or otherwise expose his bare buttocks or genitals\u201d and that \u201c[n]o females were present or within view of the defendant during this search.\u201d Defendant does not challenge these findings regarding the reasonableness of the searches of his person. These findings support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that, although the searches of defendant\u2019s person were intrusive, they were conducted in a discreet manner away from the view of others and limited in scope to finding a small amount of cocaine based on the corroborated tip of a known, reliable informant.\nAlthough defendant relies heavily on the opinion and holding in Battle to support his argument that the search the officers performed in this case was an unreasonable and intrusive public strip search that violated his constitutional rights, the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, supported by competent evidence, readily distinguish this case from the facts of Battle. First, in Battle, after stopping the vehicle in which the defendant was a passenger based on a confidential informant\u2019s tip, no drugs or drug paraphernalia were found on the scene prior to the officer\u2019s conducting a strip search of the defendant. Id. at 402, 688 S.E.2d at 823-24. Notably, the confidential informant in Battle provided no information \u201cconcerning who in the vehicle might have the drugs.\u201d Id. at 402, 688 S.E.2d at 823. In addition, although a female officer conducted the strip search of the defendant in Battle, a male officer stood close by holding a Taser gun ready for use on the defendant if she did not cooperate with the female officer\u2019s search. Id. at 379, 688 S.E.2d at 810. Further, the strip search of the defendant in Battle was conducted in broad daylight \u201con a street with both pedestrians and vehicles in the immediate vicinity.\u201d Id. at 401, 688 S.E.2d at 823. Specifically, \u201c[t]here were vehicles driving by, people on their front porches, and a nursing home slightly to the front of the vehicle[.]\u201d Id. at 393, 688 S.E.2d at 818 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \u201c[t]he State presented no evidence of exigent' circumstances\u201d and the trial court entered no findings of fact or conclusions of law as to any exigent circumstances justifying such an intrusive search of the defendant. Id. at 396, 402, 688 S.E.2d at 820, 824. Thus, in Battle, we concluded the manner in which the search was conducted was inappropriate and the place in which the search was conducted was likely to increase the humiliation of the defendant; therefore, the roadside strip search of the defendant in Battle did not pass constitutional muster. Id. at 402-03, 688 S.E.2d at 824.\nHere, however, the search of defendant was based on corroborated information that defendant himself would be carrying drugs, and a small amount of marijuana was found during the consensual search of defendant\u2019s vehicle. Moreover, the search of defendant here took place at night in a discreet location, away from any vehicle or pedestrian traffic, and no females were present during the search. Finally, the trial court specifically made findings of fact, supported by the transcript of the audio-video recording of the stop, concerning the exigent circumstances justifying the strip searches of defendant. Thus, given these circumstances, we hold the trial court properly concluded the searches of defendant\u2019s person were reasonable and did not violate his constitutional rights.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe hold the second and third searches of defendant\u2019s person in the present case can properly be classified as searches akin to strip searches, and therefore, they must be justified by both probable cause and exigent circumstances.\nTestimony by Officers Gant and Bignall support the trial court\u2019s finding of fact that the officers had probable cause to believe defendant was hiding drugs on his person, given the reliable and corroborated information provided by the confidential informant. The transcript of the audio-video recording from Officer Bignall\u2019s police vehicle supports the trial court\u2019s finding of fact regarding the exigent circumstances necessitating the strip search of defendant at the time of his arrest. Finally, although the strip searches of defendant\u2019s person were intrusive, they were conducted in a discreet manner and in a discreet location, away from the roadside, and were limited in scope to finding drugs on defendant\u2019s person.\nThus, we hold the competent evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, and the trial court\u2019s findings of fact support its conclusion of law that the strip searches of defendant\u2019s person conducted incident to his arrest in the present case were reasonable and did not violate his constitutional privacy interests.\nAffirmed.\nJudges McGEE and GEER concur.", "author": "McCullough, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Plaintiffs primarily argue that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-295.6 (2011), which placed limitations on the size and location of solid waste landfills, violates the Commerce Clause by discriminating against out-of-state waste.\nIt is undisputed that the legislation does not facially discriminate. In addition, the General Assembly, in the session law, set out in detail the purposes of the legislation, none of which in any way suggest an intent to discriminate against out-of-state waste. In the face of (1) these articulated objectives, (2) the State\u2019s long-time policy against expansion of landfills, (3) the State\u2019s failure, a year prior to enactment of the challenged legislation, to meet the State\u2019s statutorily-mandated goal for reduction of landfill use, and (4) the General Assembly\u2019s receipt, after that failure, of extensive information regarding the importance of size and location restrictions on landfills to public health, the environment, environmental justice, and financial security, plaintiffs presented only sparse evidence that the General Assembly actually had a hidden purpose of blocking out-of-state waste. Plaintiffs point to a single remark by one legislator, the presence of senators at a meeting where out-of-state waste was men tioned, and few comments by unnamed legislators in unknown contexts and by mid-level State employees, most of which comments did not specifically relate to the challenged restrictions.\nWe hold that plaintiffs have failed to forecast sufficient evidence to override the General Assembly\u2019s articulated objectives and that plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of discriminatory effect shows effects on solid waste generally and not out-of-state waste in particular. Because plaintiffs have also failed to show that any incidental effects on out-of-state waste outweigh the benefits to the State, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to defendants and defendantintervenors on the Commerce Clause claim. Since we find plaintiffs\u2019 arguments as to the other claims also unpersuasive, we affirm.\nFacts\nIn 2002, Waste Industries was approached by developers from Virginia who owned land in Camden County, North Carolina. The developers were interested in locating a municipal solid waste landfill on their property. In September 2002, Waste Industries and Camden County entered into negotiations over a franchise agreement for a solid waste landfill. In October 2002, Waste Industries formed Black Bear Disposal, LLC (\u201cBlack Bear\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waste Industries, to build and operate the landfill.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-294(b) (2001) required plaintiffs to obtain a franchise agreement from the County prior to applying for a permit to operate a solid waste facility in North Carolina. On 21 October 2002, the Camden County Commissioners passed an ordinance awarding a franchise to Black Bear. The franchise agreement (1) required Black Bear to accept only waste as \u201callowed by the permit issued\u201d by the State, (2) incorporated by reference the State\u2019s solid waste management regulations, and (3) expressly allowed termination of the agreement upon failure of the State to issue a permit or upon changes in the statutes or regulations.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-294(a)(4)(a) required the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (\u201cDENR\u201d) to \u201c[d]evelop a permit system governing the establishment and operation of solid waste management facilities.\u201d A solid waste management facility permit has two parts: (1) a permit to construct the facility issued after \u201csite and construction plans have been approved and it has been determined that the facility can be operated in accordance with the applicable rules set forth in this Subchapter\u201d; and (2) a permit to operate the facility issued after demonstrated compliance with the construction permit. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 15A, r. 13B.0201(b)(l), (2) (Sept. 2001).\nIn August 2004, Black Bear submitted a site study to DENR as required by N.C. Admin. Code tit. 15A, r. 13B.1618 (Sept. 2001), in order to obtain the necessary permit. Between August 2004 and April 2005, Black Bear made repeated additional submissions regarding the site study. DENR responded to the submissions by pointing out continued inadequacies and inconsistencies in the documentation of existing topography, surface water drainage patterns, high water table values, groundwater flow, drinking water wells, porosity values, facility acreage, landfill acreage, landfill height, and floodplain existence. According to DENR, issues still remained with the site study as of May 2005.\nIn addition, on 5 April 2005, DENR notified Waste Industries that Black Bear did not meet the financial assurance and responsibility requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-294(b2) (2005). On 3 February 2006, Waste Industries asked to be added as a co-applicant with Black Bear. DENR then requested additional information from Waste Industries and Black Bear on 16 March 2006 and on 25 May 2006.\nOn 27 July 2006, the General Assembly passed a one-year moratorium on new landfills:\nThere is hereby established a moratorium on consideration of applications for a permit and on the issuance of permits for new landfills in the State. The purposes of this moratorium are to allow the State to study solid waste disposal issues in order to protect public health and the environment. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources shall not consider a permit application nor issue a permit for a new landfill for the disposal of construction or demolition waste, municipal solid waste, or industrial solid waste for a period beginning on 1 August 2006 and ending on 1 August 2007.\n2006 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 244, \u00a7 2 (\u201cthe Moratorium\u201d). The Moratorium did not affect landfills that had permits issued prior to 1 August 2006. Id. In the Moratorium legislation, the General Assembly noted eight areas requiring more study in order to update North Carolina\u2019s solid waste laws. Id. at \u00a7 4(a).\nOn 16 April 2007, the Camden County Commissioners passed an ordinance that extended the required commencement date of landfill operation under plaintiffs\u2019 franchise agreement from 4 November 2007 to 4 November 2012. The record does not indicate that any activity took place on plaintiffs\u2019 application for a permit during the Moratorium.\nAt the end of the Moratorium, the General Assembly enacted legislation governing approval of solid-waste landfills, which included additional restrictions for landfills relating to buffers, height, capacity, and size. 2007 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 550, \u00a7 9(a), as amended by 2007 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 543, \u00a7 1(a). This legislation, codified in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-295.6, provided in pertinent part:\n(d) The Department shall not issue a permit to construct any disposal unit of a sanitary landfill if, at the earlier of (i) the acquisition by the applicant or permit holder of the land or of an option to purchase the land on which the waste disposal unit will be located, (ii) the application by the applicant or permit holder for a franchise agreement, or (iii) at the time of the application for a permit, any portion of the proposed waste disposal unit would be located within:\n(1) Five miles of the outermost boundary of a National Wildlife Refuge.\n(2) One mile of the outermost boundary of a State gameland owned, leased, or managed by the Wildlife Resources Commission pursuant to G.S. 113-306.\n(3) Two miles of the outermost boundary of a component of the State Parks System.\n(i)The Department shall not issue a permit for a sanitary landfill that authorizes:\n(1) A capacity of more than 55 million cubic yards of waste.\n(2) A disposal area of more than 350 acres.\n(3) A maximum height, including the cap and cover vegetation, of more than 250 feet above the mean natural elevation of the disposal area.\nThese restrictions (\u201cthe challenged restrictions\u201d) applied to plaintiffs\u2019 pending permit application. See 2007 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 550, \u00a7 9(b), as amended by 2007 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 543, \u00a7 1(b).\nOn 11 September 2007, DENR informed plaintiffs that their application was still incomplete and that the changes in state law might have rendered the facility unsuitable. On 15 January 2008, plaintiffs nonetheless elected to pay the $50,000.00 permit fee and proceed with their application. DENR denied plaintiffs\u2019 application for a permit on 8 May 2008 because (1) plaintiffs had continued to fail to complete the site suitability application, and (2) the site did not comply with the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-295.6(d) due to its proximity to a national wildlife refuge and a state park.\nOn 3 December 2007, plaintiffs brought suit against the State of North Carolina and DENR, alleging that 2007 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 543 and ch. 550 violated the United States Constitution and the State Constitution on various grounds and deprived plaintiffs of their common law vested rights. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a writ of mandamus.\nOn 31 December 2009, the North Carolina State Conference of Branches of the NAACP and the Rogers-Eubanks Neighborhood Association were allowed to intervene. The trial court also granted the motion to intervene of the North Carolina Coastal Federation and the North Carolina Chapter of the Sierra Club on 2 March 2010.\nAll parties moved for summary judgment. At the hearing on the motions on 24 August 2010, all parties agreed that there were no issues of material fact and that summary judgment was appropriate for the disposition of the case. On 13 September 2010, the trial court entered an order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granting defendants and defendant-intervenors\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court.\nDiscussion\nPlaintiffs contend on appeal that the challenged restrictions violate the Commerce Clause and the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, as well as their common law vested rights, and that the trial court, therefore, should have granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Alternatively, plaintiffs contend that genuine issues of material fact exist, and this case should be remanded for trial.\nSummary judgment is properly granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d N.C.R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of establishing the lack of any triable issue. Collingwood v. Gen. Electric Real Estate Equities, Inc., 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989). Once the moving party meets its burden, then the non-moving party must \u201cproduce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that the plaintiff will be able to make out at least a prima facie case at trial.\u201d Id. This Court reviews the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Mnatsakanov, 191 N.C. App. 802, 805, 664 S.E.2d 13, 15 (2008).\nI\nPlaintiffs first contend that the enacted legislation violates the federal Commerce Clause. Commerce Clause claims are subject to a two-tiered analysis. Envtl. Tech. Council v. Sierra Club, 98 F.3d 774, 785 (4th Cir. 1996). \u201cThe first tier, a virtually per se rule of invalidity, applies where a state law discriminates facially, in its practical effect, or in its purpose.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe second tier applies if a statute regulates evenhandedly and only indirectly affects interstate commerce. In that case, the law is valid unless the burdens on commerce are clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs essentially concede that the challenged legislation is not facially discriminatory, but argue that it discriminates against interstate commerce in purpose and in effect and that it, in any event, excessively burdens interstate commerce.\nA. Discriminatory Purpose\nPlaintiffs first argue that the purpose of the legislation was to block out-of-state waste from entering the State and, therefore, was to discriminate against interstate commerce. The United States Supreme Court, in Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. 456, 463 n.7, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659, 668 n.7, 101 S. Ct. 715, 723 n.7 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted), held that in considering claims that a state statute is unconstitutional, we must \u201cassume that the objectives articulated by the legislature are actual purposes of the statute, unless an examination of the circumstances forces us to conclude that they could not have been a goal of the legislation.\u201d\nApplying this standard to plaintiffs\u2019 Commerce Clause claim, we begin with a review of the General Assembly\u2019s articulated objectives. The legislature included in 2007 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 550 a series of \u201cWhereas\u201d clauses setting out the objectives of the legislation. Those clauses start by discussing the public policy of the State of protecting the State\u2019s water quality, including protecting groundwater from contamination and protecting the water quality of rivers and coastal estu aries. 2007 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 550. The clauses point to increased concerns over water quality resulting from recent flooding and drought, the reliance of half the population on groundwater for drinking water, increasing groundwater pollution, and recent documented depletion of large groundwater aquifers. Id. Next, the clauses note that the State has rare and endangered plants and animals and that the State\u2019s parks, natural areas, and wildlife refuges serve these plants and animals, as well as migrating birds. Id. The clauses then recognize that more study is needed on fragile ecosystems; that these ecosystems, along with changes in air and water quality, have impacts outside the state; and that the public should be able to continue to enjoy the natural attractions of the State. Id.\nThe General Assembly continued with the following \u201cWhereas\u201d clauses:\nWhereas, improperly sited, designed, or operated landfills have the potential to cause serious environmental damage, including groundwater contamination; and\nWhereas, it is essential that the State study the siting, design, and operational requirements for landfills for the disposal of solid waste in areas susceptible to flooding from natural disasters, areas with high water tables, and other environmentally sensitive areas in order to protect public health and the environment; and\nWhereas, it is the policy of the State to promote methods of solid waste management that are alternatives to disposal in landfills; ....\nId.\nNone of the purposes articulated by the General Assembly in the legislation suggest a purpose of discriminating against out-of-state waste entering the State. Under Clover Leaf Creamery, we must, therefore, determine whether the circumstances surrounding the legislation force us to conclude that those purposes were not the real objectives and that one of the real purposes was to discriminate against out-of-state waste. As the Fourth Circuit has observed, the \u201c \u2018historical background of the decision\u2019 \u201d is \u201c \u2018probative of whether a decisionmaking body was motivated by a discriminatory intent.\u2019 \u201d See Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Gilmore, 252 F.3d 316, 336 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. Calvert Cnty., 48 F.3d 810, 819 (4th Cir. 1995)).\nIn North Carolina, the use of landfills has been the least-preferred option for managing solid waste since the Solid Waste Management Act was enacted in 1989. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-309.04 (1989). At that time, the legislature declared that it \u201cis the policy of the State to promote methods of solid waste management that are alternatives to disposal in landfills . . . .\u201d Id. The legislature stated that it \u201cis the goal of this State to reduce the municipal solid waste stream, primarily through source reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting, on a per capita basis, on the following schedule: . . . [f]orty percent (40%) by 30 June 2001.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-309.04(c) (1992).\nGovernor James Martin issued Executive Order 86 on 1 March 1989 extending the State\u2019s 40% deadline until 2006, explaining that \u201cas the most desirable waste management strategy to be undertaken, North Carolina has stated its commitment to prevention, minimization, and recycling of wastes before they impact the State\u2019s environment and is committed to reduce its dependence on landfills as a means of solid waste disposal....\u201d N.C. Admin. Code tit. 9, r. 2B.0000 (Mar. 1989).\nBy 2006, however, North Carolina had not met the goal of a 40% per capita reduction in solid waste. In July of that year, the General Assembly passed the one-year Moratorium on new landfills to allow time for study. In the preamble to the Moratorium legislation, the General Assembly listed various concerns relating to water quality, environmentally sensitive areas, and public health. The eight areas identified as requiring more study in order to update the State\u2019s solid waste laws included financial responsibility requirements; siting, design, and operational requirements in areas susceptible to flooding from natural disasters, areas with high water tables, and other environmentally sensitive areas; and \u201c[w]ays to reduce the amount of solid waste disposed of within North Carolina landfills, including statewide tipping fees, bans on the disposal of certain types of waste in landfills, more aggressive recycling requirements, and enhanced regulatory requirements for landfills and other solid waste management facilities.\u201d 2006 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 244, \u00a7 4(a)(8). The General Assembly also established a Joint Select Committee on Environmental Justice to study environmental justice issues including \u201c[t]he impacts that landfills located in proximity to minority and low-income communities have on these communities with regard to human health, the environment, and economic development.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 5(f)(2).\nPlaintiffs argue, however, that comments made by legislators in the spring or early summer of 2006, prior to the passage of the Moratorium, suggest that the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in adopting the Moratorium was to prevent the importing of out-of-state waste. As support for this claim, plaintiffs cite the affidavit of Lonnie Craven Poole, III, CEO of Waste Industries. Mr. Poole\u2019s affidavit stated that certain legislators had reported to him that other unidentified legislators wanted to block the importing of out-of-state waste.\nDefendants and defendant-intervenors moved in the trial court to strike these portions of Mr. Poole\u2019s affidavit as hearsay, but the record contains no ruling on the motion to strike. On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the statements in Mr. Poole\u2019s affidavit were in fact considered by the trial court and properly so. Defendants and defendant-intervenors, however, contend that because the statements were inadmissible, the trial court must not have considered them and urges this Court to disregard them as well.\nEven assuming, without deciding, that the anonymous statements reported in Mr. Poole\u2019s affidavit are admissible and that the trial court considered them, the primary authority upon which plaintiffs rely for their admissibility demonstrates the statements\u2019 lack of relevance in discerning the purpose of the challenged legislation. In Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 268, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450, 466, 97 S. Ct. 555, 565 (1977) (emphasis added), the authority cited by plaintiffs as supporting admission of these statements, the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cThe legislative or administrative history may be highly relevant, especially where there are contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body, minutes of its meetings, or reports. In some extraordinary instances the members might be called to the stand at trial to testify concerning the purpose of the official action, although even then such testimony frequently will be barred by privilege.\u201d\nThe Poole affidavit statements were made in wholly unknown contexts by unknown speakers more than a year before the challenged restrictions were passed. Those secondhand statements are not part of any legislative history or any other official reporting of legislators\u2019 positions and views. Moreover, they are not contemporary to the legislation challenged on appeal. The statements considered by the Supreme Court in Village of Arlington Heights were, in contrast, contained \u201cin the official minutes\u201d and were directly related to the challenged action. Id. at 270, 50 L. Ed. 2d at 467, 97 S. Ct. at 566. Plaintiffs cite no authority \u2014 and we know of none \u2014 suggesting that the Clover Leaf Creamery circumstances warranting a court\u2019s overriding express statements of legislative purpose may include anonymous, secondhand statements made in unknown contexts and not contemporaneously with the challenged legislation.\nPlaintiffs, however, also argue that the Moratorium itself is evidence that the legislation at issue in this case had the purpose of blocking out-of-state waste. In doing so, they rely on comments made by non-legislators, primarily mid-level employees in the Executive Branch. Plaintiffs point to (1) an inquiry in 2005 \u2014 two years before the legislation at issue \u2014 from an aide to Senator Basnight to the head of the Division of Waste Management with unidentified \u201cquestions concerning out of state waste disposal\u201d; (2) a 2005 telephone call from a policy advisor in the Governor\u2019s office to a member of DENR saying that she was interested in what could be done regarding the importing of waste; (3) the 2005 annual meeting of the ERC, an Executive Branch commission, at which one of the topics was the increasing volume of both in-state and out-of-state waste in landfills; (4) a photograph presented at the 2006 annual meeting of the ERC, among other materials, showing New York waste; (5) a draft of a never-given speech prepared for the Governor in connection with the signing of the Moratorium mentioning out-of-state waste, but with no evidence of the identity of the author, whether the Governor participated in the preparation of the draft, or even whether the Governor ever saw the draft; (6) portions of Executive Branch employees\u2019 depositions indicating their awareness that four proposed landfill projects that were pending at the time of the Moratorium intended to accept out-of-state waste; and (7) a 2007 email from the Section Chief of the Division of Waste Management to a professor at UNC School of Law in which he expressed his \u201copinion\u201d that \u201cthe driving factor in the moratorium was the out-of-state waste issue.\u201d\nPlaintiffs have cited no authority that remarks by such mid-level State employees \u2014 and not legislators who enacted the Moratorium or the Governor who signed it into law \u2014 are relevant to prove that the expressed purposes of the Moratorium were not the true purposes. Nor have plaintiffs cited any authority that such comments relating to prior legislation are sufficient to override the articulated objectives in the legislation challenged as unconstitutional.\nAs for evidence regarding the challenged legislation, plaintiffs point to a single statement from a legislator: a remark made by Senator Ellie Kinnaird that the parties appear to agree was made on 26 July 2007 at unidentified \u201csenate hearings.\u201d The transcript of the hearing reports Senator Kinnaird as saying:\nI appreciate the work that\u2019s been done on this, and I think it\u2019s very important.\nAnd I hope that we pass this. It\u2019s true we\u2019re a growing state, but we don\u2019t need to be bringing in garbage from Philadelphia and New York and New Jersey. That has nothing to do with our growth.\nAnd I\u2019d like to say that while people sort of acknowledge that recycling is out there, there\u2019s recycling and recycling.\nI have two counties. One does, and I have dyslexia with numbers, but I believe one does 64% recycling.\nThe other has set a goal of 2%.\nWe can aggressively recycle.\n(Emphasis added.)\nApart from Senator Kinnaird\u2019s remark, plaintiffs point to a meeting hosted by Senator Basnight and attended by several senators at which members of the Division of Waste Management \u201cwent through the recommendations that had been presented\u201d by DENR regarding landfill regulation, such as size limitations. The head of the Division acknowledged that out-of-state waste was mentioned by unidentified individuals, but he did not remember any particular discussions regarding what steps could be taken with respect to out-of-state waste. We cannot, based on this evidence, specifically attribute a discriminatory purpose to any of the senators present.\nIn any event, defendants contend that the courts are not permitted \u201cto impute the motives or opinions\u201d of individual legislators to the entire General Assembly, citing United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 383-84, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672, 684, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 1682-83 (1968) (emphasis added), in which the United States Supreme Court held:\nInquiries into congressional motives or purposes are a hazardous matter. When the issue is simply the interpretation of legislation, the Court will look to statements by legislators for guidance as to the purpose of the legislature, because the benefit to sound decision-making in this circumstance is thought sufficient to risk the possibility of misreading Congress\u2019 purpose. It is entirely a different matter when we are asked to void a statute that is, under well-settled criteria, constitutional on its face, on the basis of what fewer than a handful of Congressmen said about it. What motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it, and the stakes are sufficiently high for us to eschew guesswork.\nPlaintiffs argue that defendants\u2019 citation of O\u2019Brien is \u201cwholly improper\u201d as the decision has essentially been overruled, citing Church of Scientology Flag Serv. Org., Inc. v. City of Clearwater, 2 F.3d 1514, 1528 (11th Cir. 1993), and Hernandez v. Woodard, 714 F. Supp. 963, 970 (N.D. Ill. 1989). Plaintiffs have, however, misread Church of Scientology and Hernandez. Those opinions questioned the viability of O\u2019Brien\u2019s holding that the Court would not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute based on an alleged illicit motive - a different issue from the reasoning above, which addressed how to prove Congressional purpose. See Church of Scientology, 2 F.3d at 1529; Hernandez, 714 F. Supp. at 970-71. In any event, subsequently, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the language questioned by the two lower federal courts. See Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Fed. Commc\u2019ns Comm\u2019n, 512 U.S. 622, 652, 129 L. Ed. 2d 497, 524, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2464 (1994).\nUnder O\u2019Brien and Clover Leaf Creamery, the speech of a single legislator (Senator Kinnaird) in an unidentified hearing and the presence of senators at a meeting at which out-of-state waste was mentioned by someone is not sufficient to void as unconstitutional N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-295.6. Village of Arlington Heights does not require a different conclusion given its focus on legislative history, sworn testimony, minutes of meetings, and reports. 429 U.S. at 268, 50 L. Ed. 2d at 465-66, 97 S. Ct. at 564-65. Nothing in Village of Arlington Heights suggests that such speech is sufficient to establish \u2014 or even raise an issue of fact \u2014 regarding the constitutionality of a statute when the legislature has specifically set out constitutional purposes in the legislation. Compare Chambers Med. Techs. of S.C., Inc. v. Bryant, 52 F.3d 1252, 1259 (4th Cir. 1995) (emphasizing before considering remarks by legislators in hearings: \u201cThe South Carolina legislature did not include a statement of the purpose for the fluctu ating treatment cap in the legislation enacting it to which this court may defer in determining the purpose of the cap, nor are there committee reports reflecting the purpose of the cap.\u201d).\nNext, plaintiffs point to the fact that DENR\u2019s proposed legislation did not include any buffer or height restrictions, and plaintiffs speculate, therefore, that DENR must not have believed such restrictions were necessary. Plaintiffs then make the additional leap of logic and argue that if DENR did not desire the challenged restrictions, then the General Assembly\u2019s articulated purposes for the restrictions must not have been the real reasons.\nPlaintiffs have, however, cited to no evidence that DENR personnel in fact believed that the restrictions were unnecessary \u2014 defendantintervenors, on the other hand, point to evidence in the record that DENR omitted the details of restrictions because the staff believed they should be left up to regulatory rule-making. Nor do plaintiffs cite any authority suggesting that an Executive Branch Department\u2019s proposed legislation \u2014 which does not even mention out-of-state waste\u2014 is relevant to determining the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting different provisions and language after considering input from a wide range of sources regarding regulation of landfills received during the study period allowed by the Moratorium.\nThe buffer, height, capacity, and size restrictions appear to have originally come from one of the intervenors, the North Carolina Coastal Federation (\u201cNCCF\u201d). The original NCCF recommendations included (1) a buffer from surface waters of 300 feet, prohibiting construction in wetlands or prior converted wetlands; (2) limiting total capacity to 25 million cubic feet; (3) limiting the area to 150 acres; and (4) limiting height to 200 feet. Lobbyists from the waste industry specifically requested that the limits be increased to 50 million cubic yards and a maximum height of 250 feet.\nUltimately, the Legislature implemented a limit of 55 million cubic yards, 5 million cubic yards in excess of what the industry lob byists had requested; an area limit of 350 acres, well above the limit requested by NCCF; and a maximum height of 250 feet, as requested by industry lobbyists. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-295.6(i). DENR\u2019s draft legislation must be considered in the context of all of the input received by the General Assembly as it was studying solid waste disposal during the Moratorium, including recommendations made by plaintiffs\u2019 own industry\u2019s lobbyists. In that context, DENR\u2019s unexplained omission of specific restrictions is not evidence of the General Assembly\u2019s having an unvoiced unconstitutional intent.\nPlaintiffs further argue that the challenged legislation cannot have environmental concerns as its actual purpose because the Legislature \u201chas made no effort to address\u201d existing landfills or prohibit expansion of existing landfills that currently violate the buffer and size restrictions. However, as our Supreme Court has noted,\n\u201c[tjhere is no constitutional requirement that a regulation, in other respects permissible, must reach every class to which it might be applied \u2014 that the Legislature must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all or none. ... It is enough that the present statute strikes at the evil where it is felt, and reaches the class of cases where it most frequently occurs.\u201d\nAdams v. N.C. Dep\u2019t of Natural & Econ. Res., 295 N.C. 683, 693, 249 S.E.2d 402, 408 (1978) (quoting Silver v. Silver, 280 U.S. 117, 123, 74 L. Ed. 2d 221, 226, 50 S. Ct. 57, 59 (1929)).\nWe turn back to the specific question before us: Does plaintiffs\u2019 evidence raise an issue of fact regarding whether the legislation at issue \u2014 specifically, the height, capacity, size, and buffer restrictions \u2014 was enacted under circumstances forcing the conclusion that the adoption of the restrictions was for the purpose of blocking out-of-state waste? We have found no case suggesting that the limited evidence presented by plaintiffs is sufficient to raise a question about whether the articulated purposes of the legislation were its actual objectives.\nPlaintiffs cite only Gilmore, 252 F.3d at 336. However, the dramatic difference in the evidence in Gilmore from that in this case demonstrates the inadequacy of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence. The Fourth Circuit, in Gilmore, upheld the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the waste industry plaintiffs on their Commerce Clause claim on the ground \u201cthat no reasonable juror could find that in enacting the statutory provisions at issue Virginia\u2019s General Assembly acted without a discriminatory purpose.\u201d Id.\nThe Fourth Circuit based its decision on evidence of (1) the General Assembly\u2019s having just learned before enacting the legislation, that Virginia was the nation\u2019s second largest importer of waste; (2) press releases by the Governor and the state senator who introduced the legislation indicating that the purpose of the legislation was to restrict the amount of out-of-state waste entering Virginia; (3) memoranda from the introducing senator to other legislators providing background information regarding'the issue of out-of-state waste imports; and (4) transcripts of speeches on the floor of the General Assembly establishing the legislature\u2019s hostility towards out-of-state waste. Id. at 336-340.\nThe Fourth Circuit concluded:\nThe evidence just outlined shows unmistakably the legislative and gubernatorial opposition to further increases in the volume of [municipal solid waste] generated outside Virginia crossing the borders of Virginia for ultimate placement in Virginia\u2019s seven regional landfills. No reasonable juror could find the statutory provisions at issue had a purpose other than to reduce the flow of [municipal solid waste] generated outside Virginia into Virginia for disposal. Indeed, the very purpose the Defendants proffer in this litigation for the enactment of the statutory provisions at issue \u2014 -to alleviate or at least reduce health and safety threats to Virginia\u2019s citizens and environment created by the importation of [municipal solid waste] from states with less strict limitations upon the content of [municipal solid waste] fully supports our conclusion. This is because an inherent component of the Defendants\u2019 proffered purpose of Virginia\u2019s enactment of the statutory provisions at issue is discrimination against [municipal solid waste] generated outside Virginia.\nId. at 340. Thus, in addition to official statements by the senator who authored the legislation, the Governor who signed it into law, and the legislators who enacted it, the State of Virginia essentially admitted, in the litigation, that the purpose of the legislation was to discriminate against out-of-state waste.\nThe evidence in this case stands in stark contrast, including the State\u2019s history of concern about the disposal of waste in landfills regardless of the source, the legislation\u2019s articulated objectives, no discriminatory statements by the sponsoring legislators, no discriminatory statements by the Governor himself, only a single remark by one senator in an unspecified hearing rather than speeches by numerous legislators during the floor debate, and stray remarks made one to two years before the enactment of the challenged legislation by unidentified legislators in unknown contexts and non-legislators. We cannot say that the content of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence \u201cforces us to conclude that [the objectives articulated] could not have been a goal of the legislation,\u201d Clover Leaf Creamery, 449 U.S. at 463 n.7, 66 L. Ed. 2d at 668 n.7, 101 S. Ct. at 723 n.7 (internal quotation marks omitted), especially in light of other circumstances identified by defendants and defendant-intervenors, including the extensive material provided to the General Assembly regarding legitimate concerns sought to be remedied.\nWe find the analysis of the Fifth Circuit persuasive:\n[T]he stray protectionist remarks of certain legislators are insufficient to condemn this statute. Our independent review of the legislative record reveals that the Legislature heard extensive testimony from various witnesses on the legitimate . . . concerns sought to be remedied .... This evidence provided a more than adequate and legitimate basis for the Legislature\u2019s decision to adopt the proposed regulations and undercuts [plaintiff\u2019s] contention that the enactment of the overall statutory scheme was driven by a discriminatory purpose.\nAllstate Ins. Co. v. Abbott, 495 F.3d 151, 161 (5th Cir. 2007). See also Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 148-50, 91 L. Ed. 2d 110, 127-28, 106 S. Ct. 2440, 2453 (1986) (\u201cBut there is little reason in this case to believe that the legitimate justifications the State has put forward for its statute are merely a sham or a post hoc rationalization. In suggesting to the contrary, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on a 3-sentence passage near the end of a 2,000-word statement submitted in 1981.... We fully agree with the Magistrate that [these] three sentences do not convert the Maine statute into an economic protectionism measure.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). In this case, we hold that plaintiffs have failed to forecast sufficient evidence that they will be able to meet the test set out in Clover Leaf Creamery and establish that the General Assembly actually had a purpose of discriminating against out-of-state waste.\nB. Discriminatory Effect\nNext, plaintiffs contend that the challenged legislation violates the Commerce Clause by having the effect of discriminating against out-of-state waste. Plaintiffs have identified three possible discriminatory effects.\nFirst, plaintiffs point to the fact that four proposed landfills, which intended to accept out-of-state waste, were not built. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ceffect\u201d argument presumes that the purpose of the legislation was to eliminate these four planned landfill projects because they intended to accept out-of-state waste. However, since we have concluded that plaintiffs failed to present evidence giving rise to an issue of fact regarding the purpose of the legislation, plaintiffs cannot rely upon that supposed \u201cpurpose\u201d to establish a discriminatory effect.\nRegardless, even assuming that the legislation had the purpose and effect of blocking the four landfills, such an \u201ceffect\u201d is not one that shows discrimination against out-of-state waste. Because the record contains no evidence that the proposed landfills would have accepted only out-of-state waste, the fact that the landfills were not built affected both in-state and out-of-state waste. Unlike in Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 57 L. Ed. 2d 475, 98 S. Ct. 2531 (1978) (holding unconstitutional statute prohibiting importing of out-of-state waste), the buffer, height, area, and capacity restrictions do not distinguish between in-state and out-of-state waste. Out-of-state waste can continue to come into the State because existing landfills can expand or new landfills can be built in compliance with the challenged restrictions.\nThe second discriminatory effect argued by plaintiffs is the fact that the restrictions make it impossible to construct large regional landfills that accept out-of-state waste in North Carolina. The legislation, however, neither prevents large regional landfills nor precludes the acceptance of out-of-state waste.\nWhen the bill was enacted, North Carolina already had existing regional landfills. Further, only two of the four proposed landfills that plaintiffs argue were the intended target of the legislation exceeded the size limitation, with the other two projects being much smaller. Indeed, the record indicates that only about 1% of the landfills currently operating in the United States are larger than the maximum size limits set out in the challenged legislation. Finally, the height restrictions were what waste industry lobbyists had suggested, and the capacity was five million cubic yards bigger than the industry had requested.\nThus, the effect of the legislation was not to preclude regional landfills, but rather to prevent only extraordinarily large landfills regardless of where the waste came from. Regional landfills exist and can continue to be built subject to the restrictions, and nothing prohibits them from taking in only out-of-state waste.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 third discriminatory effect is the \u201cnear impossibility,\u201d as they contend, of construction of a landfill along North Carolina\u2019s coast, thereby hindering use of the most cost-effective means of transporting waste from out of state: barging. The United States Supreme Court has held, however, that \u201c[w]e cannot. . . accept [the] underlying notion that the Commerce Clause protects the particular structure or methods of operation in a . . . market.\u201d Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117, 127, 57 L. Ed. 2d 91, 101, 98 S. Ct. 2207, 2215 (1978). As the Fourth Circuit has explained, \u201c[t]he Clause does not purport to ... protect the participants in intrastate or interstate markets, nor the participants\u2019 chosen way of doing business.\u201d Brown v. Hovatter, 561 F.3d 357, 364 (4th Cir. 2009) (emphasis added). The barging of waste \u2014 rather than transporting it by truck or rail \u2014 is the plaintiffs\u2019 chosen way of doing business and that particular way of doing business is not protected by the Commerce Clause.\nThe trial court, therefore, did not err in concluding that plaintiffs failed to present evidence of discriminatory effect sufficient to avoid summary judgment. Because of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to demonstrate that the legislation is discriminatory facially, in purpose, or in effect, strict scrutiny does not apply, and we need not address plaintiffs\u2019 arguments regarding whether demonstrable justifications exist for the restrictions and whether there are non-discriminatory alternatives.\nC. Rational Basis Review\nWe next consider whether the legislation is unconstitutional based on its incidental effect on interstate commerce. As the United States Supreme Court has explained:\nAlthough the criteria for determining the validity of state statutes affecting interstate commerce have been variously stated, the general rule that emerges can be phrased as follows: Where the statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\nPike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142, 25 L. Ed. 2d 174, 178, 90 S. Ct. 844, 847 (1970).\nThe United States Supreme Court applied Pike in United Haulers Ass\u2019n v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 550 U.S. 330, 346, 167 L. Ed. 2d 655, 669, 127 S. Ct. 1786, 1797 (2007). In United Haulers, a flow control ordinance required that \u201call solid waste generated within the Counties be delivered to the [Solid Waste Management] Authority\u2019s processing sites.\u201d Id. at 336,167 L. Ed. 2d at 663, 127 S. Ct. at 1791. The fees charged by the Authority\u2019s processing sites were significantly more than the fees charged at alternative facilities, all of which were out of state. Id. at 336-37, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 663-64, 127 S. Ct. at 1791-92.\nHowever, the requirement that solid waste be delivered to the Authority provided environmental benefits, health benefits, and revenue, id. at 334-35, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 662, 127 S. Ct. at 1790-91, because the Authority\u2019s higher fees allowed it to provide extensive recycling, composting, household hazardous waste disposal, and other services, in addition to standard landfill transportation and solid waste disposal. Id. at 336, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 663, 127 S. Ct. at 1791. The Supreme Court concluded that the public benefits outweighed any incidental burden on interstate commerce that existed. Id. at 346, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 670, 127 S. Ct. at 1797.\nNotably, in United Haulers, the Court characterized the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the laws did not pass the \u201cmore permissive Pike test\u201d as an invitation \u201cto rigorously scrutinize economic legislation passed under the auspices of the police power.\u201d Id. at 347, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 670, 127 S. Ct. at 1798. The Court observed that \u201c[t]here was a time when this Court presumed to' make such binding judgments for society, under the guise of interpreting the Due Process Clause. We should not seek to reclaim that ground for judicial supremacy under the banner of the dormant Commerce Clause.\u201d Id. (internal citation omitted).\nIn this case, the challenged legislation similarly provides environmental, public health, environmental justice, and financial security benefits. Although plaintiffs protest that the State presented no scientific basis for any of these benefits, plaintiffs have cited no authority holding that a legislature must have a scientific basis for benefits that are the purpose of legislation. Instead, what is required is that the legislation \u201ceffectuate a legitimate local public interest,\u201d Pike, 397 U.S. at 142, 25 L. Ed. 2d at 178, 90 S. Ct. at 847, which the legislation at issue in this case does.\nStill, defendants and defendant-intervenors have pointed to expert evidence supporting the buffer and size restrictions, including a letter from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a comprehensive study of the financial and physical failures of mega-landfills, and expert testimony regarding environmental justice issues, air and water quality impacts, and the effect on sensitive areas of non-native species attracted by landfills. The General Assembly had an ample basis for concluding that the legislation promoted -the local purposes set out in the legislation itself.\nPlaintiffs also argue that any benefits are cancelled out by the fact that existing landfills violating the restrictions may continue to operate or even expand, while, in addition, other offensive projects might be constructed in the buffer zones. \u201cGrandfathering\u201d by the legislature of some landfills does not make the legislation\u2019s requirements for new landfills \u201carbitrary or irrational.\u201d Clover Leaf Creamery, 449 U.S. at 468, 66 L. Ed. 2d at 671, 101 S. Ct. at 726. Further, as the Supreme Court emphasized, \u201ca legislature need not strike at all evils at the same time or in the same way,\u201d but instead \u201ca legislature may implement [its] program step by step, . . . adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil and deferring complete elimination of the evil to future regulations.\u201d Id. at 466, 66 L. Ed. 2d at 670, 101 S. Ct. at 725 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nFinally, plaintiffs claim the burdens on interstate commerce are driving up the cost of disposal in North Carolina. Whatever additional cost results from the implementation of the statute will impact the cost of waste disposal for North Carolina\u2019s citizens. Just like the United States Supreme Court in United Haulers, we do not believe that it is our place to weigh in on the uniquely legislative public policy debate over whether the increased costs of waste disposal outweigh the benefits to the environment, public health, and environmental justice.\nThe United States Supreme Court, applying Pike, ended its Clover Leaf Creamery analysis by emphasizing: \u201cOnly if the burden on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the State\u2019s legitimate purposes does such a regulation violate the Commerce Clause.\u201d Id. at 474, 66 L. Ed. 2d at 675, 101 S. Ct. at 729. Here, plaintiffs have not forecast evidence meeting that burden, and, therefore, the challenged legislation does not violate the Commerce Clause. The trial court properly granted summary judgment to defendants and defendant-intervenors on plaintiffs\u2019 Commerce Clause claim.\nII\nPlaintiffs next contend that the enacted legislation violates the Contract Clause of the federal constitution by substantially impairing plaintiffs\u2019 franchise agreement with the County. Whether a change in state law is an impairment of contract in violation of the Contract Clause \u201chas three components: whether there is a contractual relationship, whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment is substantial.\u201d Gen. Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 186, 117 L. Ed. 2d 328, 337, 112 S. Ct. 1105, 1109 (1992).\nThere is no dispute in this case that a contract exists. As for the second element, the United States Supreme Court stressed in Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 462 U.S. 176, 190, 76 L. Ed. 2d 497, 509-10, 103 S. Ct. 2296, 2305 (1983) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted):\nAlthough the language of the Contract Clause is facially absolute, its prohibition must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the State to safeguard the vital interests of its people. This Court has long recognized that a statute does not violate the Contract Clause simply because it has the effect of restricting, or even barring altogether, the performance of duties created by contracts entered into prior to its enactment. If the law were otherwise, one would be able to obtain immunity from state regulation by making private contractual arrangements.\nThe Contract Clause does not deprive the States of their broad power to adopt general regulatory measures without being concerned that private contracts will be impaired, or even destroyed, as a result.\nHere, the legislation at issue did not retroactively alter any rights of plaintiffs or Camden County under the franchise agreement or change either party\u2019s obligations. The franchise agreement did not grant plaintiffs a right to build or operate a landfill, but rather simply made it possible for plaintiffs to apply to the State for a permit allowing them to build and operate the landfill. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 130A-294(bl)(2) (\u201cA person who intends to apply for a new permit, the renewal of a permit, or a substantial amendment to a permit for a sanitary landfill shall obtain, prior to applying for a permit, a franchise for the operation of the sanitary landfill from each local government having jurisdiction over any part of the land on which the sanitary landfill and its appurtenances are located or to be located.\u201d (emphasis added)).\nThe agreement did not guarantee plaintiffs would receive a permit or even be able to build their landfill. Indeed, the agreement anticipated that a permit might be denied or \u2014 as happened here \u2014 the law governing landfills might be changed. Either party could terminate the agreement if (1) \u201cDENR fails or refuses to issue, grant or renew any permit,\u201d (2) \u201cany change occurs in any applicable existing law, regulation, rule, ordinance or permit condition,\u201d or (3) \u201cany new law, regulation, rule, ordinance or permit condition\u201d adversely affected the project. Thus, the franchise agreement expressly contemplated what ultimately happened: the law changed.\nPlaintiffs, however, argue that under Faulkenbury v. Teachers\u2019 & State Emps.\u2019 Ret. Sys. of N.C., 345 N.C. 683, 483 S.E.2d 422 (1997), the legislation \u201ccannot constitutionally be applied to prevent Plaintiffs\u2019 plans to build and operate the Proposed Landfill.\u201d In Faulkenbury, although the plaintiffs had vested retirement and disability benefits, state law changed reducing their disability retirement payments. Id. at 690, 483 S.E.2d at 426. The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201cpursuant to the plaintiffs\u2019 contracts, they were promised that if they worked for five years, they would receive certain benefits if they became disabled. The plaintiffs fulfilled this condition. At that time, the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to benefits in case they were disabled became vested. The defendants could not then reduce the benefits.\u201dId. at 692, 483 S.E.2d at 428.\nNo similar contract existed here. The very terms of the franchise agreement anticipated that change could occur and, in fact, that plaintiffs might never be able to build or operate their landfill. Plaintiffs had no rights under the franchise agreement that could be considered analogous to the vested rights in Faulkenbury. Because plaintiffs have not forecast any evidence that their contract with Camden County was unconstitutionally impaired, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to defendants and defendantintervenors on the Contract Clause cause of action.\nIll\nLastly, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because they had a common law vested right and, therefore, were entitled to have the law applied to their landfill project as it existed before the change in the statutes. As set forth by this Court in Browning-Ferris Indus. of S. Atl., Inc. v. Guilford, Cnty. Bd. of Adjustment, 126 N.C. App. 168, 171-72, 484 S.E.2d 411, 414 (1997) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted):\nThe common law vested rights doctrine is rooted in the due process of law and the law of the land clauses of the federal and state constitutions and has evolved as a constitutional limitation on the state\u2019s exercise of its police power[s]. A party\u2019s common law right to develop and/or construct vests when: (1) the party has made, prior to the amendment of a zoning ordinance, expenditures or incurred contractual obligations substantial in amount, incidental to or as part of the acquisition of the building site or the construction or equipment of the proposed building; (2) the obligations and/or expenditures are incurred in good faith; (3) the obligations and/or expenditures were made in reasonable reliance on and after the issuance of a valid building permit, if such permit is required, authorizing the use requested by the party, and (4) the amended ordinance is a detriment to the party. The burden is on the landowner to prove each of the above four elements.\n(Emphasis added.)\nFor landfill projects, state law required a permit. Because no permit was issued in this case, plaintiffs cannot meet the requirement for the vested rights analysis that their expenditures on the proposed landfill \u201cwere made in reasonable reliance on and after the issuance of a valid . . . permit.\u201d Id. at 171, 484 S.E.2d at 414 (emphasis added). As a result, plaintiffs had no common law vested rights in the proposed landfill.\nPlaintiffs assert that Mission Hosps., Inc. v. N.C. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., 205 N.C. App. 35, 696 S.E.2d 163 (2010), entitled them \u201cto have the law as it existed prior to the change.\u201d In Mission Hospital, the appellant received letters from the State confirming certain equipment and leases did not require Certificates of Need (CON). Id. at 37-38, 696 S.E.2d at 167. After purchase agreements were issued for the equipment, id. at 38, 696 S.E.2d at 170, the CON law was amended. Id., 696 S.E.2d at 168. The amended statutes required a CON for the equipment. Id., 696 S.E.2d at 169-70. This Court held that since the valid, binding purchase agreements occurred at a time when no CON was required, appellant had' a vested right in the equipment. Id. at 46, 696 S.E.2d at 171-72.\nHere, of course, a permit was in fact required at the time plaintiffs entered into the franchise agreement. As a result, Browning-Ferris controls, and plaintiffs have failed to show any violation of their common law vested rights. See Griffin v. Town of Unionville, N. C., 338 F. App\u2019x 320, 324-25 (4th Cir. 2009) (unpublished) (holding that even though plaintiff had entered into franchise agreement with local government, it had no vested right to build industrial solid waste facility when State denied permit because \u201c[wjhere multiple permits or governmental approvals are required for a project, a landowner has no vested right to complete that project unless he makes his substantial expenditures in good faith reliance on and after receiving all requisite permits or other required approvals\u201d).\nIn an argument related to their vested rights claim, plaintiffs next contend that the Legislature \u201cmisuse[d] the political process in order to dictate the outcome of an application to use one\u2019s property in a particular way.\u201d Plaintiffs cite Robins v. Town of Hillsborough, 361 N.C. 193, 639 S.E.2d 421 (2007) for the proposition that this Court has found such activity unconstitutional.\nIn Robins, the plaintiff filed a development plan with the Town of Hillsborough\u2019s Board of Adjustment to build an asphalt plant. Id. at 194-95, 639 S.E.2d at 423. The Court explained: \u201cInstead of following the proper procedures by which the Board of Adjustment would have rendered an up or down decision on plaintiff\u2019s application, defendant [Town], acting through its Board of Commissioners, passed the moratorium [on asphalt plants] and eventually amended the ordinance [banning all asphalt plants], effectively usurping the Board of Adjustment\u2019s responsibility in the matter.\u201d Id. at 199, 639 S.E.2d at 425.\nThe Court reasoned that \u201c[i]n essentially dictating by legislative fiat the outcome of a matter which should be resolved through quasi-judicial proceedings, defendant did not follow its own ordinance pertaining to the disposition of site specific development plans, thus leaving the Town Board no defense to the charge that its actions were arbitrary and capricious.\u201d Id. The Court then held that \u201cwhen the applicable rules and ordinances are not followed by a town board; the applicant is entitled to have his application reviewed under the ordinances and procedural rules in effect as of the time he filed his application.\u201d Id.\nAny resemblance between Robins and this case is at best superficial. Plaintiffs do not contend that the General Assembly failed to follow the applicable rules when passing the challenged legislation. Moreover, the relationship between the Hillsborough Board of Commissioners and the Board of Adjustment is not analogous to the relationship between the General Assembly and DENR in this case.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 assertions that only an executive agency \u2014 DENR\u2014-had the ability to regulate solid waste disposal and that the General Assembly \u201ceffectively usurped NCDENR\u2019s responsibility\u201d disregards the basic civics principle that the legislature enacts the laws, while the executive branch carries out those laws. See State v. Harris, 216 N.C. 746, 754, 6 S.E.2d 854, 860 (1940) (\u201cIn licensing those who desire to engage in professions or occupations such as may be proper subjects of such regulation, the Legislature may confer upon executive officers or bodies the power of granting or refusing to license persons to enter such trades or professions only when it has prescribed a sufficient standard for their guidance. Where such a power is left to the unlimited discretion of a board, to be exercised without the guide of legislative standards, the statute is not only discriminatory but must be regarded as an attempted delegation of the legislative function offensive both to the State and the Federal Constitution.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).\nIt is well established that \u201c[n]o one has the right for the General Assembly not to change a law.\u201d State ex rel. Banking Comm\u2019n v. Citicorp Sav. Indus. Bank of N.C., 74 N.C. App. 474, 477, 328 S.E.2d 895, 897 (1985). Additionally, \u201cno person has a vested right in a continuance of the common or statute law. It follows that, generally speaking, a right created solely by the statute may be taken away by its repeal or by new legislation.\u201d Pinkham v. Mercer, 227 N.C. 72, 78, 40 S.E.2d 690, 694 (1946).\nPlaintiffs have not cited any further evidence which would demonstrate that the actions of the Legislature were a misuse of the political process. Plaintiffs could not reasonably rely on the franchise agreement, as a permit was necessary before beginning the project, and the General Assembly followed the applicable procedures in adopting the Moratorium and then amending the solid waste disposal statutes. Therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment for defendants and defendant-intervenors on this claim as well.\nAffirmed.\nJudges STROUD and THIGPEN concur.\n. Because of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in O\u2019Brien, we need not decide whether our Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in D & W, Inc. v. City of Charlotte, 268 N.C. 577, 581-82, 151 S.E.2d 241, 244, supplemented by 268 N.C. 720, 152 S.E.2d 199 (1966) (holding that affidavit from legislator was \u201cincompetent\u201d to prove \u201clegislative purpose\u201d of General Assembly in enacting legislation), is controlling authority with respect to a claim under the federal constitution for violation of the Commerce Clause.\n.

Green for Defendant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STEPHENS, Judge.\nFactual and Procedural Background\nOn 10 February 2011, a jury found Defendant Ransom Martin Jones guilty of second-degree murder in the 2006 death of Sarah Slaton. This conviction followed unusually tangled legal proceedings in the trial court, which began in November 2006 when Defendant was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Between his 2006 arrest and eventual conviction in 2011, Defendant had three attorneys serve as both his appointed counsel and as standby counsel during several periods when Defendant waived counsel and proceeded pro se.\nRichard T. McNeil was appointed counsel for Defendant in November 2006 after Defendant\u2019s arrest. At a July 2009 pretrial motions hearing, Defendant moved the court to allow him to waive the assistance of counsel and represent himself in all proceedings. Defendant\u2019s motion was granted, and McNeil was appointed standby counsel. In August 2009, with Defendant appearing pro se, the case was tried to a jury and resulted in a mistrial.\nAt a motions hearing on 12 January 2010, Defendant asserted that he wished to represent himself at his retrial. McNeil was again appointed standby counsel. At a February 2010 hearing, McNeil was removed as standby counsel due to a medical issue. On 9 March 2010, the trial court issued an order substituting Walter Paramore as standby counsel for Defendant. On 16 March 2010, Defendant requested that Paramore serve as his attorney of record instead of standby counsel, and the trial court entered an order assigning Paramore as Defendant\u2019s attorney of record for his retrial.\nOn 16 June 2010, however, Defendant submitted a pro se motion to disqualify Paramore as his attorney. Following a hearing, the trial court made findings of fact that \u201c [Defendant requested that Paramore be removed for . . . not pursuing claims (prosecutorial, law enforcement, and defense attorney misconduct) that [Defendant thinks relevant and germane to his defense.\u201d In addition, the court found that Paramore informed the court he would not pursue Defendant\u2019s suggested claims because the claims had no merit. Paramore asserted that he was ethically precluded from pursuing such frivolous claims. As a result, the court concluded that Paramore\u2019s ability to effectively represent Defendant was substantially impaired, and on 21 June 2010, issued an order removing Paramore as Defendant\u2019s attorney. William Gerrans was subsequently appointed as Defendant\u2019s new counsel. On 14 July 2010, Gerrans filed a motion to be appointed standby counsel for Defendant on the basis of a conflict between Gerrans and Defendant (regarding Defendant\u2019s requests for Gerrans to present theories of misconduct in his defense of Defendant).\nAt a hearing on 17 November 2010, Defendant again expressed his desire to represent himself and signed a written waiver of counsel. The court ordered a competency examination and thereafter deemed Defendant competent to stand trial by order filed 3 December 2010. Defendant, acting pro se, was convicted of second-degree murder on 10 February 2011 and sentenced to 300 to 369 months in prison.\nStandard of Review\nThis Court reviews alleged violations of constitutional rights de novo. State v. Tate, 187 N.C. App. 593, 599, 653 S.E.2d 892, 897 (2007). \u201cUnder the de novo standard of review, this Court considers the matter anew and freely substitutes its own judgment for that of the trial court.\u201d State v. Williams, ,_N.C. App._,_, 702 S.E.2d 233, 236 (2010) (citations and quotation marks omitted).\nFailure of Counsel to Comply with Defendant\u2019s Wishes\nDefendant first argues that the trial court erred in failing to engage Defendant in a colloquy pursuant to State v. Ali, 329 N.C. 394, 402, 407 S.E.2d 183, 189 (1991), and instruct appointed defense counsel to comply with his client\u2019s wishes. We disagree.\nDefendant presents arguments regarding his representation by McNeil. However, because McNeil was ultimately removed as Defendant\u2019s counsel for reasons that were unrelated to the disagreement between Defendant and his counsel, we need not consider any alleged violation regarding McNeil\u2019s representation of Defendant. Therefore, only Defendant\u2019s representation by Paramore and Gerrans is relevant on appeal.\nDefendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct his appointed counsel to defer to Defendant\u2019s own wishes regarding trial strategy and his defense. Defendant wished for both Paramore and Gerrans to present a theory of police, prosecutorial, and defense attorney misconduct and conspiracy in his defense. Defendant relies on Ali, in which \u201cthe defendant claim[ed] the trial court denied him his right to assistance of counsel by allowing him, rather than his lawyers, to make the final decision regarding whether [a particular person] would be seated as a juror..\u201d 329 N.C. at 402, 407 S.E.2d at 189. In holding that the defendant had not been denied his right to counsel, our Supreme Court noted that \u201c]t]he attorney is bound to comply with her client\u2019s lawful instructions, and her actions are restricted to the scope of the authority conferred.\u201d Id. at 403, 407 S.E.2d at 189 (citation and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).\n[T]actical decisions, such as which witnesses to call, whether and how to conduct cross-examinations, what jurors to accept or strike, and what trial motions to make are ultimately the province of the lawyer. However, when counsel and a fully informed criminal defendant client reach an absolute impasse as to such tactical decisions, the client\u2019s wishes must control; this rule is in accord with the principal-agent nature of the attorney-client relationship.\nId. at 404, 407 S.E.2d at 189 (citations and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).\nHere, there exists an entirely different situation than that presented in Ali, where the defendant and his counsel disagreed about tactical decisions. Defendant in this case sought to have his attorneys follow instructions to present claims that they felt \u201cha[d] no merit.\u201d Thus, the impasse was not over \u201ctactical decisions,\u201d but rather over whether Defendant could compel his counsel to file frivolous motions and assert theories that lacked any basis in fact. Nothing in Ali or our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence requires an attorney to comply with a client\u2019s request to assert frivolous or unsupported claims. In fact, to do so would be a violation of an attorney\u2019s professional ethics: \u201cA lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law or fact for doing so that is not frivolous ...\u201d N.C. St. B. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 3.1 (emphasis added).\nIndeed, it is to their credit that Paramore and Gerrans both recognized that complying with Defendant\u2019s requests would have vio lated their duties as officers of the court. In the motion to be appointed standby counsel, Gerrans stated that\nDefendant is convinced that prior counsel Richard McNeil and Private Investigator Jerry Waller somehow conspired with Prosecutor Ann Kirby and the Morehead City Police Department to \u201cframe\u201d the Defendant. Mr. Gerrans is certain that neither Mr. McNeil, Mr. Waller, nor Ms. Kirby did anything improper. Counsel is ethically and professionally obligated to act in compliance with the law.\nDefendant had the same disagreements regarding trial strategy with Paramore, whose response was substantially the same. In its order removing Paramore, the trial court stated: \u201cParamore candidly informed the court that he will not pursue [Defendant's suggested claims because [] Paramore contends that said claims have no merit and that [] Paramore is ethically precluded from pursuing such claims.\u201d\nIn sum, the decision in this case (whether to present theories of misconduct and conspiracy that have no basis in fact) is clearly distinguishable from the tactical decision at issue in Ali (whether to use a peremptory challenge to strike a juror). Because nothing in our case law requires counsel to present theories unsupported in fact or law, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct counsel to defer to Defendant\u2019s wishes. This argument is overruled.\nWaiver of Counsel\nDefendant\u2019s second argument on appeal is that the waiver of his constitutional right to counsel was invalid because the trial court \u201cmisadvised\u201d Defendant regarding his right to compel defense counsel to comply with Defendant\u2019s wishes where they were at an impasse. As discussed supra, the trial court did not erroneously advise Defendant about his rights pursuant to Ali (Ali being inapplicable to Defendant\u2019s disagreement with his appointed trial counsel), and thus Defendant\u2019s argument regarding the validity of his waiver based on Ali must fail.\nAlthough Defendant does not present any argument that his waiver was invalid beyond that premised on the alleged violation of the principles established by Ali, in an abundance of caution, we consider whether the trial court complied with the requirements for accepting a waiver of counsel as provided in section 15A-1242 of the North Carolina General Statutes:\nA defendant may be permitted at his election to proceed in the trial of his case without the assistance of counsel only after the trial judge makes thorough inquiry and is satisfied that the defendant:\n(1) Has been clearly advised of his right to the assistance of counsel, including his right to the assignment of counsel when he is so entitled;\n(2) Understands and appreciates the consequences of this decision; and\n(3) Comprehends the nature of the charges and proceedings and the range of permissible punishments.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1242 (2011).\nAt the 17 November 2010 hearing, after determining that Defendant was competent to go to trial, the trial court engaged in the following colloquy with Defendant:\nThe Court: We\u2019re not going to talk about the facts of your case here but I do need to make some findings here. First of all, are you thinking clearly this morning?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: Have you taken any medication or consumed any substance that would impair your judgment in any way?\n[Defendant]: No, sir.\nThe Court: Do you feel okay today?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: All right. Bill Gerrans now represents you. He is your attorney; do you understand that?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: He\u2019s indicated to me that once again you\u2019ve confirmed to him that you wish to have him withdrawn and that he just serve as what\u2019s called Standby Counsel and that you be allowed to represent yourself; did you hear Mr. Gerrans say that?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: Do you wish to represent yourself, Ransome?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: Are you sure about that?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: Now once again, we\u2019ve talked about this several times and I believe you understand that the Court is of the opinion that, that would be a mistake; is that true?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: And you understand that Mr. Gerrans is of the opinion that, that would be a mistake. Do you understand that to be the case?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: You also understand, and I believe the Court has told you before, that regardless of what the Court thinks about it and regardless of what Mr. Gerrans thinks about it, it\u2019s important as to what you think about it. Do you understand that?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: And that I will not impose my judgment on you if I\u2019m satisfied that you\u2019re making an informed decision that you have the capacity to do that. Do you understand that?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: Now, you understand that if you are convicted of first-degree murder that the Court has no choice but to punish you by way of a sentence of the rest of your life in prison; do you understand that?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: And you also understand that the first trial resulted in a hung jury?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: Okay. And do you understand that the district attorney might have the benefit of using whatever transpired at the first trial to tweak or hone the way he presents evidence in this next coming trial. Do you understand that?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: Do you have any questions of the Court, Ransome? Is there anything that you want to say other than you just want to represent yourself because if you would like to make a statement or make a presentation or showing to the Court I\u2019m going to listen to anything that you have to say.\n[Defendant]: Nothing right now, Your Honor, except that I would just like Mr. Gerrans to talk about the motions that he\u2019s filed.\nThe Court: So before the Court rules on your motion to withdraw Mr. Gerrans and represent yourself, you want him to prosecute the motions on your behalf?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: I understand that. Here\u2019s the deal though and I probably am going to allow that.\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: But if we get to the point where the Court subsequently withdraws Mr. Gerrans and puts him as standby counsel, what we can\u2019t do, Ransome, is like during the trial go back and forth between Mr. Gerrans representing you and Mr. Gerrans not representing you. We can\u2019t jump in and out of those particular status because Mr. Gerrans is either going to be your attorney or he\u2019s just going to be there to be of counsel to you in the event that you wish to ask him a question. Does that make sense to you?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: By way of illustration, if the Court withdraws Mr. Gerrans and has him as standby counsel, he\u2019ll be there during the trial. If you have a question during jury selection you can reach over and ask Mr. Gerrans a question or whisper to him and he\u2019ll whisper to you and he might give you his thoughts on the matter or give you some advice as to what to do. But ultimately when the Court makes a decision, the Court will be looking for you to make a statement as opposed to Mr. Gerrans.\nIf it comes to opening statements or examination of witnesses or decisions as to whether or not to testify, you can call upon Mr. Gerrans during the course of the trial and ask upon him for his advice but ultimately it will be up to you to decide whether or not to make an opening statement, a closing argument, what questions to ask a witness, whether or not to testify. Do you understand all of that?\n[Defendant]: Yes, sir.\nThe Court: All right. Do you have any questions about any of that?\n[Defendant]: No, sir.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the court stated:\nThe Court is satisfied that Mr. Jones understands the nature and consequences of his actions. He understands the gravity of this case. He understands what the possible punishment could be if convicted. He understands the seriousness of the offense. He\u2019s clearly of sound mind. He\u2019s thinking clearly and he has unequivocally expressed to the Court his desire to represent himself.\nIn addition to the extensive colloquy between the trial court and Defendant at that hearing, Defendant also signed a written waiver of counsel on the same date.\nThe quoted colloquy establishes that, during the hearing, the court advised Defendant of his right to continue with Gerrans as his appointed attorney or to represent himself and have Gerrans act as standby counsel, satisfying subsection (1) of our State\u2019s waiver of counsel statute. The court further explained the role and limits of standby counsel and emphasized that final decisions during trial would be Defendant\u2019s responsibility. The court had also previously suggested strongly that Defendant not proceed pro se, explaining that Gerrans was an experienced criminal defense attorney who would represent Defendant ably. These exchanges ensured that Defendant understood the consequences of his decision as required by subsec tion (2). In addition, the court informed Defendant that he faced a charge of first-degree murder, which would result in a sentence of life in prison if Defendant was convicted, satisfying subsection (3). Thus, the court fully complied with the requirements of section 15A-1242. Accordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.\nNO ERROR.\nJudges MCGEE and HUNTER, JR., ROBERT N., concur.\n. Earlier in the hearing, the trial judge had noted that he and Defendant had encountered each other in various legal proceedings over many years, and the judge subsequently began referring to Defendant by his first name. In addition, Defendant\u2019s name is spelled \u201cRansome\u201d in the hearing transcript, but appears on the conviction and judgment as \u201cRansom.\u201d", "author": "STEPHENS, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Estoppel \u2014 judicial estoppel \u2014 inconsistent positions in prior and present actions \u2014 no abuse of discretion\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in its application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel as to plaintiff Harris. Harris\u2019s failure to list on his bankruptcy petition his involvement and ownership interest in plaintiff T-WOL was inconsistent with the position that he took in this action. Thus, Harris was estopped from claiming any ownership interest in or position as an officer or director of T-WOL.\n2. Fiduciary Relationship \u2014 breach of fiduciary duty \u2014 sole shareholder of corporation \u2014 no duty owed to directors or officers\nThe trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiff Colbert\u2019s claims of constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, usurpation of corporate opportunity, and unfair and deceptive trade practices, which were based on defendant Edmond\u2019s alleged breach of fiduciary duty due to the transfer of the disputed property. Edmonds, as the sole shareholder of plaintiff T-WOL, did not owe a fiduciary duty to the directors or officers of T-WOL and could dispose of the disputed property as he saw fit.\n3. Fiduciary Relationship \u2014 breach of fiduciary duty \u2014 sole shareholder of corporation \u2014 no duty owed corporation\nThe trial court did not err by dismissing plaintiff T-WOL\u2019s claims of constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, usurpation of corporate opportunity, and unfair and deceptive trade practices, which were based on defendant Edmonds alleged breach of fiduciary duty. As defendant Edmonds was the sole shareholder of plaintiff of T-WOL, he did not owe a fiduciary duty to the corporation itself and could dispose of the disputed real property as he saw fit.\n4. Fiduciary Relationship \u2014 breach of fiduciary duty \u2014 alleged accountant for corporation \u2014 no duty owed\nThe trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, constructive fraud, and unfair and deceptive trade practices against defendant Clark. Clark, alleged to be the accountant for plaintiff T-WOL, did not owe any duty to T-WOL. Furthermore, plaintiffs\u2019 claims against defendant ECDG South, LLC were also properly dismissed as ECDG\u2019s only role in the lawsuit was that it was the company to which the disputed property was transferred, a transfer which was determined to be valid.\nAppeal by plaintiffs from order and judgment entered 19 April 2011 by Judge Michael R.

After carefully untangling the knots as best we can based upon the record before us and the applicable law, we affirm the trial\u2019s court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of ECDG South, LLC, John L. Edmonds, and Rudolph Clark, Jr. (\u201cdefendants\u201d), from which T-WOL Acquisition Company, Inc., Terence A. Colbert, and Hal H. Harris (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) have appealed.\nI. Factual Background\nThe weaving of this web of deception started sometime in the early 1990\u2019s, when defendant Edmonds began trying to develop low income housing on three parcels of real property (\u201cthe disputed property\u201d) located in Durham, North Carolina. Because defendant Edmonds lived in New York, he needed someone present in North Carolina- to assist him with this process. He first enlisted Gilford A. Finch for this purpose and Fair City-Pines Corporation was created to hold the disputed property, but the attempts of Mr. Finch and defendant Edmonds to develop the disputed property were unsuccessful and devolved into litigation, in manner quite similar to this lawsuit. Plaintiff T-WOL was created as part of defendant Edmonds\u2019 second attempt to develop the disputed property and this second attempt is the genesis of this lawsuit.\nBased upon the affidavits, depositions, and documents filed with the parties\u2019 summary judgment motions, along with the parties\u2019 pleadings, it appears that in 1999 defendant Edmonds approached plaintiff Harris and asked for his assistance in developing low-income housing in Durham. For this purpose they formed T-WOL Acquisition Company, Inc. (\u201cT-WOL\u201d) on 19 September 2000. On 25 October 2000, plaintiff Harris and defendant Edmonds were named as directors; 500 shares of T-WOL stock were issued to plaintiff Harris and 350 shares were issued to defendant Edmonds; defendant Edmonds was elected as president and plaintiff Harris as vice president and secretary; and the corporation adopted bylaws. Also on 25 October 2000, defendant Edmonds assigned to T-WOL his rights to \u201camounts loaned to Gilford A. Finch and Fair City-Pines Corporation\u201d and \u201creal property promised in payment thereof by Fair City-Pines Corporation . . . and Gilford A. Finch[,]\u201d which arose from defendant Edmonds\u2019 first attempt to develop the same real property in Durham and the ensuing lawsuit, as discussed above.\nOne day later, on 26 October 2000, plaintiff Harris signed stock certificates purporting to transfer his 500 shares to plaintiff Colbert. Despite the fact that plaintiff Harris had just transferred his stock to plaintiff Colbert, on 21 December 2000, defendant Edmonds and plaintiff Harris signed a stock assignment agreement which affirmed that defendant Edmonds and plaintiff Harris were the only shareholders of T-WOL. Only twenty days later, on 9 January 2001, plaintiff Harris filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection claiming over $42 million in debts and $11,398.00 in assets. Plaintiff Harris did not disclose any interest in T-WOL or any transfer of stock in T-WOL on his bankruptcy petition. On 20 March 2001, Fair City-Pines Corporation transferred the disputed property by general warranty deed to T-WOL pursuant to the assignment by defendant Edmonds. On 13 June 2001, plaintiff Harris received a discharge of debt from the bankruptcy court.\nAbout two years later, on 1 June 2003, plaintiff Colbert signed stock certificates transferring the 500 shares of T-WOL stock back to plaintiff Harris. About three years after this transfer, on 5 May 2005, the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State administratively dissolved T-WOL \u201cfor failure to file an annual report[.]\u201d\nAbout seven years after plaintiff Harris\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy and three years after the administrative dissolution of plaintiff T-WOL, on 11 January 2008, defendant Clark filed articles of organization for ECDG South as a North Carolina limited liability company. On 24 April 2008, defendant Edmonds executed a special warranty deed as president of T-WOL transferring the disputed property to ECDG South, LLC. On 15 August 2008, defendant Edmonds as a member/manager of ECDG South LLC executed a deed of trust on the disputed property to obtain a loan for ECDG South LLC from NewBridge Bank.\nOver a year after the transfer of the disputed property to ECDG South, LLC, on 22 April 2009, without advising defendant Edmonds of their plans to reinstate T-WOL, plaintiffs Colbert and Harris filed an application for reinstatement for T-WOL with the Secretary of State. After they had \u201ccaused all the back year tax returns and annual reports to be filed\u201d the dissolution was cancelled and T-WOL was reinstated \u201ceffective as of the 5th day of May, 2005.\u201d\nOn 25 August 2009, plaintiffs filed a verified complaint against defendants alleging that defendant John L. Edmonds had wrongfully transferred real property from plaintiff T-WOL Acquisition Company, Inc. to defendant ECDG South, LLC and raising claims for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, usurpation of corporate opportunity, conversion, unfair and deceptive trade practices, specific performance to transfer real property back to plaintiffs, a declaratory judgment that the deed transferring the contested real property be null and void, and for punitive damages. On the same date, plaintiffs filed a notice of lis pendens describing the nature of the complaint and the real property involved. On 26 October 2009, defendants filed their answer denying plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, raising a motion to dismiss pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6), raising the affirmative defense of fraud, and requesting that plaintiffs\u2019 claims be dismissed with prejudice. About 16 months later, defendants obtained new counsel and on 23 February 2011, filed a motion to amend their answer to add counterclaims for judicial dissolution of T-WOL Acquisition Company, Inc., unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary obligation, civil conspiracy, forgery, false pretenses, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and for punitive damages. Following a hearing on defendants\u2019 motion on 7 March 2011, the trial court on 23 March 2011 entered an order allowing in part and denying in part defendants\u2019 motion, providing specifically as follows:\n1. Defendants\u2019 Motion to Amend is allowed in part and denied in part.\na. To the extent the Amended Answer raises affirmative defense those defenses/amendments are allowed, including Breach of Fiduciary Obligation, Civil Conspiracy, Forgery, and False Pretenses.\nb. To the extent the Amended Answer attempts to seek affirmative relief through counterclaims/amendments [those] are denied, without prejudice.\n2. Defendants can raise these denied amendments after the conclusion of the trial in this matter, either as equitable remedies, in a bifurcated trial, or in a new trial, at the discretion of the Trial Judge.\n3. Defendants cannot pursue Discovery on their counterclaims until such time as those claims are raised.\nOn or about 1 April 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, with supporting affidavits and documentation. Defendants filed affidavits with supporting documentation in response to plaintiffs\u2019 motion.\nBy order entered 19 April 2011, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, ruling that\nas a result of the Court\u2019s application of judicial estoppel in its discretion on the issues of stock ownership and stock transfer, which estoppel arises from Plaintiff Harris\u2019s sworn statements in the aforementioned bankruptcy proceedings, see Bioletti v. Biolette, 693 S.E.2d 691 (N.C. App. 2010), and the Court being of the opinion, therefore, that summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs should be denied and Summary Judgment in favor of the Defendants should be granted[.]\nThe trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants, dissolved the Us pendens, and ordered that the corporate records for T-WOL be delivered to counsel for defendant Edmonds. Plaintiffs filed timely notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s 19 April 2011 order.\nII. Summary judgment\nThe standard of review from a motion for summary judgment is well established:\nSummary judgment is appropriate \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c). \u2018A trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment receives de novo review on appeal, and evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u2019 Sturgill v. Ashe Memorial Hosp., Inc., 186 N.C. App. 624, 626, 652 S.E.2d 302, 304 (2007), disc. review denied, 362 N.C. 180, 658 S.E.2d 662 (2008).\nMitchell, Brewer, Richardson, Adams, Burge & Boughman, PLLC v. Brewer,_N.C. App._,_, 705 S.E.2d 757, 764-65 (2011) (quoting Liptrap v. Coyne, 196 N.C. App. 739, 741, 675 S.E.2d 693, 694 (2009)), disc. review denied, 365 N.C. 188, 707 S.E.2d 243 (2011). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cplaintiff[s] cannot surmount an affirmative defense which would bar the claim.\u201d Gibson v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 121 N.C. App. 284, 286, 465 S.E.2d 56, 58 (1996) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\nPlaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in \u201cgranting summary judgment in favor of defendants!)]\u201d Specifically, plaintiffs contend that (1) a material issue of fact existed as to plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, usurpation of corporate opportunity, and unfair and deceptive trade practices; (2) declaratory judgment should have been entered in favor of plaintiffs; (3) the trial court erred in applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel; (4) the trial court erred in applying the law of resulting trust; and (5) the trial court erred in ordering T-WOL to surrender its records to defendants\u2019 counsel.\nDefendants counter that the trial court\u2019s order should be affirmed as (1) plaintiff Harris is barred by judicial estoppel from claiming an ownership interest in T-WOL which makes defendant Edmonds the sole shareholder of T-WOL; (2) plaintiff Colbert is barred by the statute of limitations from claiming ownership of T-WOL stock; (3) the trial court correctly applied the doctrine of resulting trust as defendant Edmonds had \u201cprovided all the consideration for the acquisition and maintenance of [the disputed property;]\u201d (4) plaintiff Colbert \u201chad no right to apply for reinstatement of the corporate status of T-WOL after its Administrative Dissolution in 2005[;]\u201d (5) as the sole owner of T-WOL defendant Edmunds is entitled to the corporate records of T-WOL; (6) plaintiffs received defendants motion for summary judgment 13 days before the hearing, within the time permitted by Rule 56(c); and (7) claims against defendant Clark were properly dismissed because plaintiffs failed to show that they had any contract with defendant Clark. As the issue of judicial estoppel is dispositive, we address it first. Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in considering the doctrine of judicial estoppel and in the alternative, erred in its application of the doctrine.\nA. Shareholder derivative suit\nBefore addressing judicial estoppel, we must note that although plaintiffs have not referred to it as such, this lawsuit is essentially a derivative lawsuit, as both individual plaintiffs seek to redress alleged wrongs to the corporation, plaintiff TWOL, and to have the disputed property returned to T-WOL. Although the complaint requests recovery of damages for all of the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d without distinguishing between the rights of the corporation as opposed to the individual plaintiffs, and prays \u201c[t]hat the Defendants be ordered to transfer the property back to Plaintiffs, free of any and all encumbrances and liens, pursuant to the [Declaratory Judgment] Cause of Action,\u201d all of the claims arise from the actions of the defendants in regard to plaintiff T-WOL and the disputed property. (emphasis added.) We also note that defendants have not argued that this is properly a derivative lawsuit, or that plaintiffs have failed to allege the requisites of a derivative lawsuit.\nAs a general rule, shareholders have no right to bring actions \u201cin their [individual] name[s] to enforce causes of action accruing to the corporation^\u201d Fulton v. Talbert, 255 N.C. 183, 185, 120 S.E.2d 410, 412 (1961), but must assert such claims derivatively on behalf of the corporation. Robinson \u00a7 17-2(a) at 333. A correct characterization of the shareholder\u2019s action as derivative or individual may be crucial, as there are certain mandatory procedural and pleading requirements for a derivative action. F.H. O\u2019Neal & R. Thompson, O\u2019Neal\u2019s Oppression of Minority Shareholders \u00a7 7:07 (2d ed. 2000), p. 52. Some procedural restrictions proceed from concerns about prevention of a multiplicity of lawsuits and concern over \u201cwho should properly speak for the corporation.\u201d Id. Other restrictions arise from concerns that derivative actions will be misused by \u201c \u2018self-selected advocate[s]\u2019 pursuing individual gain rather than the interests of the corporation or the shareholders as a group, bringing costly and potentially meritless \u2018strike suits.\u2019 \u201d Id.\nThus, for example, a shareholder who brings a derivative action in North Carolina must show that he or she \u201c[f] airly and adequately represents the interests of the corporation in enforcing the right of the corporation[,]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-7-41 (1999), and may not commence the action until written demand on the corporation\u2019s directors has been made and the statutory period has elapsed. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-7-42 (1999). Further, the corporation may then determine by a majority vote of \u201cindependent\u201d directors that maintenance of the derivative action \u201cis not in the best interest of the corporation.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-7-44(a)(b)(l) (1999). \u201cIndependent\u201d directors may include persons who have been nominated or elected by persons who are defendants in the derivative action, persons who are themselves defendants in the derivative action, and persons who approve of the act being challenged. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-7-44(c)(l)(2)(3) (1999). \u201cIf the corporation commences an inquiry into the allegations set forth in the demand or complaint, the court may stay a derivative proceeding for a period of time the court deems appropriate.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-7-43 (1999). Finally, the derivative suit may not be settled without the approval of the court. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-7-45(a) (1999). It is of obvious importance to the parties that the recovery in a derivative action goes to the corporation, not to the plaintiff personally. Outen v. Mical, 118 N.C. App. 263, 266, 454 S.E.2d 883, 885 (1995).\nNorman v. Nash Johnson & Sons\u2019 Farms, Inc., 140 N.C. App. 390, 395-96, 537 S.E.2d 248, 253-54 (2000), disc. review denied, 353 N.C. 378, 547 S.E.2d 14 (2001). The primary purpose of this lawsuit is to restore the disputed property to plaintiff T-WOL; the only benefit to the individual plaintiffs is as shareholders in T-WOL. But since no party has addressed any issues as to the requirements for a derivative lawsuit under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-7-41 el. seq., we shall not either, and we express no opinion on these issues. But we do note that the first requirement of a derivative lawsuit, or any of the claims which plaintiffs have alleged, is to establish the identity of the shareholders of T-WOL, and these are the issues which the parties have argued at length. We will therefore examine the arguments actually raised, as these are dispositive.\nB. Judicial estoppel\nDefendants claim that although Plaintiff Harris may nominally be a shareholder of T-WOL, he is judicially estopped from exercising any rights as a shareholder based upon his failure to identify his interest in T-WOL in his 9 January 2001 bankruptcy petition, in which he was required by law to identify this interest but he did not, and he obtained a discharge in bankruptcy. Thus, we must first consider whether plaintiff Harris, as a shareholder, is barred from participation in this action.\n1. Consideration\nPlaintiffs argue that defendants should not have been allowed to present the affirmative defense of judicial estoppel as they did not plea this affirmative defense in their amended answer as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 8(c). Plaintiffs also argue that since the trial court\u2019s prior 23 March 2011 order, regarding defendants\u2019 motion to amend, denied defendants\u2019 motion to add counterclaims and allowed certain affirmative defenses, not including judicial estoppel, the trial court erred in allowing defendants to \u201cpresent the affirmative claim of judicial estoppel\u201d in violation of its prior order.\nDefendants contend that contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments the trial court\u2019s 23 March 2011 order regarding the amendment of defendants\u2019 answer stated that defendants could not raise counterclaims but allowed them to \u201cpresent any affirmative defenses[;]\u201d defendants served their affidavit which addressed judicial estoppel in response to plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment; and pursuant to the trial court\u2019s 23 March 2011 order regarding defendants\u2019 motion to amend and N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(e), the trial court properly considered the affirmative defense of judicial estoppel.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 8(c) (2009) states that \u201c[i]n pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively.. . estoppel . . . and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d Generally, estoppel is an affirmative defense which must be plead with certainty. Duke University v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., 95 N.C. App. 663, 673, 384 S.E.2d 36, 42 (1989). \u201cBroadly speaking, judicial estoppel prevents a party from acting in a way that is inconsistent with its earlier position before the court.\u201d Powell v. City of Newton, 364 N.C. 562, 569, 703 S.E.2d 723, 728 (2010) (citing Whitacre P\u2019ship v. Biosignia, Inc., 358 N.C. 1, 28-29, 591 S.E.2d 870, 888-89 (2004)). We note that defendants did not directly mention or allege facts that would raise the affirmative defense of judicial estoppel in their initial answer. Nor did defendants\u2019 proposed amended answer include the affirmative defense of judicial estoppel, although it did allege others. Therefore, defendants did not raise judicial estoppel as an affirmative defense in their pleadings. Contrary to defendants\u2019 argument, the trial court\u2019s 23 March 2011 order granting in part and denying in part defendants\u2019 motion to amend their answer did not permit defendants to raise \u201cany affirmative defenses\u201d but stated that defendants could raise their affirmative claims as affirmative defenses; barred defendants from making new counterclaims in their amended answer; but permitted defendants to raise their counterclaims at the end of the trial \u201ceither as equitable remedies, in a bifurcated trial or in a new trial, at the discretion of the Trial Judge.\u201d None of defendants\u2019 affirmative claims or counterclaims were based upon judicial estoppel.\nYet the failure to plead judicial estoppel does not end our inquiry, as \u201calthough the failure to plead an affirmative defense ordinarily results in its waiver, the parties may still try the issue by express or implied consent.\u201d Id. at 673, 384 S.E.2d at 42 (citation omitted). N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(b) (2009) provides as follows:\nWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by the express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, either before or after judgment, but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be served thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.\nOur Supreme Court discussed the application of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(b) as follows:\n[T]he implication of Rule 15(b) ... is that a trial court may not base its decision upon an issue that was tried inadvertently. Implied consent to the trial of an unpleaded issue is not established merely because evidence relevant to that issue was introduced without objection. At least it must appear that the parties understood the evidence to be aimed at the unpleaded issue.\nEudy v. Eudy, 288 N.C. 71, 77, 215 S.E.2d 782, 786-87 (1975) (citations omitted), overruled on other grounds in Quick v. Quick, 305 N.C. 446, 457-58, 290 S.E.2d 653, 661 (1982). Here, on or about 1 April 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56, with supporting documentation and affidavits, arguing that there was no genuine issue of material fact as the forecast of evidence showed that defendant Edmonds was not the sole shareholder of T-WOL when he transferred the contested real property, as plaintiff Harris and/or Colbert were also shareholders. Subsequently, defendants filed the \u201caffidavit of John L. Edmonds, Esq. in response to plaintiffs [sic] motion for summary judgment\u201d pursuant to Rule 56(e) and supporting documentation, which alleged that plaintiff Harris denied any ownership interest in T-WOL in his previous bankruptcy filings. The record shows that both parties argued extensively and specifically for and against the application of judicial estoppel at the 11 April 2011 hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and plaintiffs made no objection to the consideration of judicial estoppel on the grounds that it was not included in defendants\u2019 pleadings. Therefore, by the \u201cimplied consent\u201d of the parties, the trial court properly considered the doctrine of judicial estoppel. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(b).\n2. Application\nPlaintiffs argue next that the trial court erred in its application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel. Plaintiffs, citing Whitacre P\u2019ship v. Biosignia, Inc., 358 N.C. 1, 38, 591 S.E.2d 870, 894 (2004), argue that plaintiff Harris\u2019s position in this case is consistent with his position in the bankruptcy, as he did not own the T-WOL shares when he filed for bankruptcy and was not required to disclose the transfer of T-WOL shares, as it was done \u201cin the ordinary course of business\u201d to secure \u201ca commitment [from plaintiff Colbert] to advance money in the future for T-Wol purposes[.]\u201d Plaintiffs further argue that \u201cthere is no threat to judicial integrity\u201d because plaintiff Harris had not \u201cintent ionally misled the bankruptcy court\u201d as he consulted with \u201cmultiple attorneys regarding his bankruptcy, including Edmonds[;]\u201d and plaintiffs \u201cwill not gain an unfair advantage or cause an unfair detriment to Defendants by allowing [plaintiffs] to present evidence Edmonds was not the only share holder of T-Wol\u201d because defendant Edmonds advised plaintiff Harris not to list \u201ceverything in his bankruptcy\u201d and defendant Edmonds was listed as a creditor numerous times on defendant Harris\u2019s bankruptcy schedule. Plaintiffs further argue that judicial estoppel should be applied to defendants as defendant Edmonds had stated in his affidavit that he was the sole shareholder of T-WOL but later acknowledged that he was not.\nDefendants counter that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in applying judicial estoppel. Defendants argue that the undisputed facts establish that plaintiff Harris denied in his bankruptcy being an officer or director in the corporation, any ownership interest in T-WOL, or any transfer of T-WOL stock; in contrast plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings state that plaintiff Harris was the owner of T-WOL stock; despite the omission of T-WOL from his bankruptcy property listings, plaintiff Harris received the benefit of bankruptcy discharge; this omission was not inadvertent; and plaintiff Harris was properly judicially estopped from claiming an ownership interest in T-WOL.\nWe have recently summarized the doctrine of judicial estoppel as follows:\nOur Supreme Court first recognized the doctrine of judicial estoppel in Whitacre P\u2019ship v. Biosignia, Inc., 358 N.C. 1, 591 S.E.2d 870 (2004), and noted that \u201cthe circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle.\u201d Id,. at 28, 591 S.E.2d at 888 (quotation omitted). The purpose of this doctrine is \u201cto protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment[.]\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). \u201c[Jjudicial estoppel forbids a party from asserting a legal position inconsistent with one taken earlier in the same or related litigation. \u2019\u2019Price v. Price, 169 N.C. App. 187, 191, 609 S.E.2d 450, 452 (2005). In Whitacre P\u2019ship, our Supreme Court set forth three factors which may be considered in determining whether the doctrine is applicable:\nFirst, a party\u2019s subsequent position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding might pose a threat to judicial integrity by leading to inconsistent court determinations or the perception that either the first or the second court was misled. Third, courts consider whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\nWhitacre P\u2019ship, 358 N.C. at 29, 591 S.E.2d at 888-89 (internal citations and quotations omitted). The first factor is the only factor that must be present for judicial estoppel to apply. Wiley v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 164 N.C. App. 183, 188, 594 S.E.2d 809, 812 (2004). . . . \u201c[judicial estoppel is to be applied in the sound discretion of our trial courts.\u201d Whitacre P\u2019ship, 358 N.C. at 33, 591 S.E.2d at 891.\nEstate of Means v. Scott Elec. Co.,_N.C. App._,_, 701 S.E.2d 294, 298-99 (2010). Our Supreme Court has further stated that judicial estoppel \u201cseeks to protect the courts, not litigants, from individuals who would play \u2018fast and loose with the judicial system\u2019 \u201d and is a \u201cdiscretionary equitable doctrine . . . providing courts with a means to protect the integrity of judicial proceedings].]\u201d Whitacre P\u2019ship, 358 N.C. at 26, 591 S.E.2d at 887.\nIn Bioletti v. Bioletti, 204 N.C. App. 270, 693 S.E.2d 691 (2010), this Court addressed the application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel to the plaintiff\u2019s claims in light of his inconsistent position in his prior bankruptcy proceeding. In Bioletti, the plaintiff filed a petition seeking relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, alleging that he did not have any funds to pay his creditors. Id. at 270, 693 S.E.2d at 692. Thirteen days later, the defendant\u2019s brother William Bioletti died and, as a result of his death, the plaintiff was entitled to certain \u201cmonies and financial accounts].]\u201d Id. at 270-71, 693 S.E.2d at 692. However, the plaintiff executed a \u201chand written agreement\u201d transferring away any interest he was entitled to receive to the defendant. Id. at 271, 693 S.E.2d at 692. A meeting of creditors was held and subsequently the bankruptcy court entered an order granting the plaintiff\u2019s request for bankruptcy discharge. Id. The plaintiff then amended his property schedule in the bankruptcy proceeding indicating that he had received $24,747.19 as a result of William Bioletti\u2019s death and the bankruptcy court issued a final decree closing the plaintiffs bankruptcy case. Id. The plaintiff subsequently filed a complaint against defendant alleging that the defendant \u201chad unlawfully converted to her own use monies which he was entitled to receive from insurance policies and retirement accounts owned by William Bioletti\u201d and raising claims for fraud and conversion, for the imposition of a constructive trust, and for punitive damages. Id. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss and alternatively a motion for summary judgment arguing that the plaintiffs claims were barred by laches and judicial estoppel. Id. at 271, 693 S.E.2d at 693. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel and the plaintiff appealed. Id. at 273, 693 S.E.2d at 694. This Court first determined that the plaintiff\u2019s position in the current case was inconsistent with the position that he took in the bankruptcy proceeding as the plaintiff was contending that he was entitled to recover in excess of $92,000 from defendant \u201cwhich originated from insurance contracts, retirement accounts or similar instruments originally owned by William Bioletti[,]\u201d but had only reported to the bankruptcy Court that he had received $24,747.19, in violation of the bankruptcy code provisions requiring him to disclose all of the monies from William Bioletti\u2019s estate. Id. at 276-78, 693 S.E.2d at 696-97 (footnote omitted). This Court next determined that the plaintiff had succeeded in persuading the bankruptcy court to accept that the value of his interest in William Bioletti\u2019s estate was only $24,797.14 as he never disclosed the full amount of the monies he was entitled to and received a discharge in bankruptcy. Id. at 278-79, 693 S.E.2d at 697. This Court, after noting that\n[a]lthough this Court has no bankruptcy jurisdiction and is reluctant, for that reason, to render an opinion concerning the effect that any understatement of Plaintiff\u2019s claim to monies resulting from William Bioletti\u2019s death may have had on the outcome of his bankruptcy proceeding,\nalso determined that the \u201cPlaintiff would obtain an unfair advantage in the event that we were to overturn the trial court\u2019s decision to the effect that Plaintiff was judicially estopped from proceeding against Defendant in this case\u201d as the defendant had paid all of the plaintiff\u2019s creditors in full in the bankruptcy and, if successful in his suit, he would also receive \u201can amount in excess of $ 92,000 from Defendant[.]\u201d Id. at 279, 693 S.E.2d at 697. This Court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel and affirmed the trial court\u2019s summary judgment order in favor of the defendant. Id. at 279-80, 693 S.E.2d at 697-98.\nAccordingly, we must first consider whether the position that plaintiff Harris has taken in the case before us is inconsistent with the position that he took in the bankruptcy proceeding. It is undisputed that approximately two and a half months after the formation of T-WOL, on 9 January 2001, defendant Harris filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York, listing total liabilities of over $42 million and total assets of $11,398.00. Schedule B of the bankruptcy filings required defendant Harris to list \u201call personal property of the debtor of whatever kind\u201d including \u201cStock and interests in incorporated and unincorporated businesses.\u201d Plaintiff Harris listed his ownership of 100 shares of \u201cThe Winback Organization Ltd\u201d but made no mention of any ownership of T-WOL stock. We note that while plaintiff Harris\u2019s bankruptcy was pending, Fair City-Pines Corporation on 20 March 2001 transferred by general warranty deed the disputed property to T-WOL pursuant to the assignment by defendant Edmonds. About two weeks later, in his ongoing bankruptcy proceeding, plaintiff Harris filed his \u201cStatement of Financial Affairs\u201d on 3 April 2001. In this filing, plaintiff Harris was required to list, inter alia, \u201call other property, other than property transferred in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor, transferred either absolutely or as security within one year immediately preceding the commencement of this case.\u201d Plaintiff Harris did not list shares of T-WOL that he allegedly transferred to plaintiff Colbert. The bankruptcy filing also required plaintiff Harris to list any income received \u201cother than from employment, trade, profession, or operation of the debtor\u2019s business during the two years immediately preceding the commencement of this case.\u201d Again, plaintiff Harris did not list the $10,000 he claimed he had received from plaintiff Colbert in exchange for his 500 shares in T-WOL but only listed $500 in lottery winning in 1999. The bankruptcy filing also required plaintiff Harris to\nlist the names and addresses of all businesses in which the debtor was an officer, director, partner, or managing executive of a corporation . . . within the two years immediately preced ing the commencement of this case or in which the debtor owned 5 percent or more of the voting or equity securities within the two years immediately preceding the commencement of this case.\nAgain, plaintiff Harris made no mention of his previous or ongoing involvement in T-WOL. Plaintiff Harris received a discharge from the bankruptcy court in June of 2001.\nIn contrast to his bankruptcy filings, plaintiffs in their verified complaint alleged that plaintiff Harris was the sole director when T-WOL was incorporated, he was later named as one of the two directors, one of the two shareholders, and was vice president and secretary of T-WOL, and transferred his shares to plaintiff Colbert. Even though plaintiffs argue that plaintiff Harris did not list the transfer of shares to plaintiff Colbert because it was in the \u201cordinary course of business,\u201d the bankruptcy filing still required to disclose the names of any corporation \u201cin which the debtor owned 5 percent or more of the voting or equity securities within the two years immediately preceding the commencement of this case.\u201d (emphasis added.) Looking to the evidence in the record, we note the corporate records for T-WOL show that on 25 October 2000 the following action was taken: (1) Ben Sirmons, the registering agent, assigned the corporation to defendant Edmonds and plaintiff Harris; (2) by \u201cconsent to organizational action[,]\u201d bylaws were adopted, defendant Edmonds was elected as president, plaintiff Harris was elected as vice president and secretary, and 350 shares were issued to defendant Edmonds and 500 shares were issued to plaintiff Harris; and (3) by \u201cconsent to action without meeting,\u201d plaintiff Harris and defendant Edmonds elected themselves as directors of T-WOL. Also on 25 October 2000, defendant Edmonds, assigned to T-WOL his rights to \u201camounts loaned to Gilford A. Finch and Fair City-Pines Corporation\u201d and \u201creal property promised in payment thereof by Fair City-Pines Corporation . . . and Gilford A. Finch[.]\u201d Upon examination of all of plaintiff Harris\u2019s machinations, it is obvious that he sought to \u201cplay \u2018fast and loose with the judicial system\u2019 \u201d see Whitacre P\u2019ship, 358 N.C. at 26, 591 S.E.2d at 887, and that he has repeatedly taken inconsistent positions based upon what might be most beneficial to him at the moment. We hold that, just as the plaintiff in Bioletti, plaintiff Harris\u2019s failure to list in his bankruptcy his involvement and ownership interest in T-WOL was inconsistent with the position that he is taking in this action.\nWe also hold that plaintiff Harris succeeded in persuading the bankruptcy court to accept that he had no involvement or ownership interest in T-WOL as he never disclosed any involvement in T-WOL to the bankruptcy court and ultimately received a discharge in bankruptcy. Like the Court in Bioletti, we will not speculate as to whether the bankruptcy court would have ruled differently in his bankruptcy proceeding if plaintiff Harris had disclosed his involvement in T-WOL, but if we were to rule in his favor, reversing summary judgment, and plaintiffs ultimately succeed in their claims at trial, plaintiff Harris would receive his interest as a shareholder in T-WOL, which would then have value as T-WOL would also own the disputed property, allowing him to derive an unfair advantage from his inconsistent positions. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel as to plaintiff Harris and plaintiff Harris is estopped from claiming any ownership interest in or position as an officer or director of T-WOL. We also note that our application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel to plaintiff Harris creates an insurmountable obstacle to plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims, as discussed below. See Gibson, 121 N.C. App. at 286, 465 S.E.2d at 58.\nC. Plaintiff Colbert\nPlaintiffs also contend that the trial court \u201cmisapplied the doctrine of judicial estoppel by using it to bar not only Harris\u2019s claims, but also the claims asserted by T-WOL and Colbert.\u201d Defendants argue that the only shareholders of T-WOL were plaintiff Harris and defendant Edmonds; plaintiff Harris is judicially estopped from claiming to be a shareholder or that he transferred shares to plaintiff Colbert; and defendant Edmonds as the sole shareholder of T-WOL could \u201cdissolve the corporation and dispose of its assetsf.]\u201d As discussed below, plaintiffs\u2019 claims are ultimately based on the existence of and breach of a fiduciary duty by the defendants to each particular plaintiff. To answer the parties\u2019 contentions, we must first look at the forecast of evidence to determine plaintiff Colbert\u2019s involvement or position in T-WOL, as he is alleged by plaintiffs to be the president, director, and a shareholder in T-WOL, to determine what duty, if any, defendants owed plaintiff Colbert.\n1. Status as Shareholder\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-1-40(22) (2009) defines a \u201cShareholder\u201d as\nthe person in whose name shares are registered in the records of a corporation or the beneficial owner of shares to the extent of the rights granted by a nominee certificate on file with a corporation.\nPlaintiffs have presented inconsistent allegations regarding plaintiff Colbert\u2019s status as shareholder. First, plaintiffs alleged in their verified complaint that plaintiff Colbert is a shareholder in T-WOL based upon plaintiff Harris\u2019s transfer of his 500 shares to plaintiff Colbert in 26 October 2000. But in his deposition, plaintiff Colbert admitted that he was never a stockholder in T-WOL because defendant Edmonds did not sign the share certificates. In his deposition, he repeatedly claimed to have \u201can interest\u201d in T-WOL because he had provided $10,000.00 to Harris for use in the development of the disputed property but ultimately admitted that this was a personal loan to Harris and he was not a shareholder in T-WOL. However, in their brief on appeal, plaintiffs argue that the shares were properly transferred to plaintiff Colbert because they were endorsed by plaintiff Harris and delivered to plaintiff Colbert. Yet at oral argument before this Court, plaintiffs took the position that even plaintiffs do not actually know whether plaintiff Harris or plaintiff Colbert is a shareholder, but assert that this is irrelevant as summary judgment should be-reversed either way, as one of them must be. Defendants counter that plaintiff Colbert was never a shareholder in T-WOL because the shares were never properly transferred to plaintiff Colbert as they were never delivered or endorsed by defendant Edmonds, as president.\nDespite their contradictory positions, plaintiffs allege in their verified complaint, and the corporate records of T-WOL show, that on 1 June 2003, plaintiff Colbert transferred the 500 shares of T-WOL stock back to plaintiff Harris. Thus, if the original transfer from plaintiff Harris was valid and plaintiff Colbert was a shareholder, he ceased to be a shareholder when he transferred the 500 shares back to plaintiff Harris. Accordingly, the evidence, even when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, tends to show that plaintiff Colbert is not and was not at the time of filing of this lawsuit a shareholder of T-WOL. Since we have already determined that plaintiff Harris is estopped from claiming to be a shareholder in T-WOL, and plaintiff Colbert is not a shareholder in T-WOL, defendant Edmonds is the sole shareholder of T-WOL.\n2. Director and Officer\nNext, we turn to examine plaintiff Colbert\u2019s other positions in T-WOL. Even if he was not a shareholder, plaintiff Colbert claims to have authority to act for plaintiff T-WOL as president. Plaintiff Colbert testified that he was president from 2005 onward and plaintiff Harris testified that defendant Edmonds signed the consent to action forms electing plaintiff Colbert as president. According to T-WOL\u2019s corporate records, plaintiff Colbert was elected as a director at the latest on 24 October 2003 by \u201cconsent to action without meeting of the shareholders\u201d and elected as president on 25 October 2005. As noted above, defendant Edmonds transferred the contested real property from T-WOL to ECDG South on 24 April 2008. Therefore, according to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, plaintiff Colbert, not defendant Edmonds, was the president and director of T-WOL when the disputed property was transferred out of T-WOL.\nDefendant Edmonds states in his affidavit that he has never met plaintiff Colbert, he was never notified of the consent without meeting votes, he never consented to the appointment of plaintiff Colbert as president and director, and those \u201cdocuments are fraudulent and do not represent my will or consent.\u201d Also included in the record is an affidavit from Albert H. Lyter, III, an expert in forensics, in which he states that he examined the consent to action without meeting documents and opined that \u201cthey were not prepared in the year indicated on the document\u201d and the signers \u201csigned them all at once\u201d concluding that the documents \u201cwere not prepared over the time period indicated on the documents (2000 to 2005) but were prepared simultaneously by each signer.\u201d Therefore, there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether plaintiff Colbert was president and a director of T-WOL when defendant Edmonds transferred the property from T-WOL to ECDG South. We must next determine whether this amounts to an issue of \u201cmaterial\u201d fact. See Mitchell, _N.C. App. at_, 705 S.E.2d at 764-65.\nPlaintiff Colbert\u2019s claims for constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, usurpation of corporate opportunity, and unfair and deceptive trade practices are all based on plaintiffs\u2019 claims of an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by defendant Edmonds in transferring the disputed property from T-WOL to ECDG South LLC and defendant Clark\u2019s participation in this breach of duty. See Governor\u2019s Club Inc. v. Governors Club Ltd. P\u2019ship, 152 N.C. App. 240, 249-50, 567 S.E.2d 781, 787-88 (2002) (noting that the claim of constructive fraud requires a breach of a fiduciary duty and \u201callegations sufficient to allege constructive fraud are likewise sufficient to allege unfair and deceptive trade practices.\u201d), affirmed per curium by 357 N.C. 46, 577 S.E.2d 620 (2003); Meiselman v. Meiselman, 309 N.C. 279, 307, 307 S.E.2d 551, 567 (1983) (noting that a corporate director or officer can breach their fiduciary duty by usurpation of a corporate opportunity); Muse v. Morrison, 234 N.C. 195, 198, 66 S.E.2d 783, 785 (1951) (noting that for the claim of civil conspiracy there must be an underlying wrongful act resulting in injury). Therefore, given plaintiffs\u2019 claims, it is their contention that defendant Edmonds, as the sole shareholder of T-WOL, owes plaintiff Colbert a fiduciary duty because he is president and a director of T-WOL. \u201cA claim for breach of fiduciary duty requires the existence of a fiduciary duty.\u201d Governor\u2019s Club Inc., 152 N.C. App. at 247, 567 S.E.2d at 786. A fiduciary relationship \u201cexists in all cases where there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence.\u201d Stone v. McClam, 42 N.C. App. 393, 401, 257 S.E.2d 78, 83, disc. review denied, 298 N.C. 572, 261 S.E.2d 128 (1979) (citation omitted). \u201cAs a general rule, shareholders do not owe a fiduciary duty to each other or to the corporation.\u201d Freese v. Smith, 110 N.C. App. 28, 37, 428 S.E.2d 841, 847 (1993) (citing Robinson, North Carolina Corporation Law, \u00a7 11.4 (1990)) . However, directors and officers of a corporation owe a fiduciary duty to the corporation and the shareholders. See Meiselman v. Meiselman, 58 N.C. App. 758, 774 295 S.E.2d 249, 259 (1982) (noting that \u201c[directors of a corporation are trustees of the property of the corporation for the benefit of the corporate creditors, as well as shareholders.\u201d), modified and aff\u2019d, 309 N.C. 279, 307 S.E.2d 551 (1983); N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-8-30 (2009) (listing the fiduciary duties of a corporate director); N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-8-42 (2009) (listing the fiduciary duties of corporate officers). However, we find no North Carolina authority addressing the con straints imposed on the actions of an individual regarding a corporate asset who, like defendant Edmonds, is effectively the sole shareholder and a director of the corporation. It appears that the consensus in other jurisdictions is that a sole shareholder of a corporation is generally free to dispose of corporate assets as he sees fit, except where such actions harm or defraud the corporation\u2019s creditors, or otherwise violate public policy. See Anderson v. Benson, 394 N.W.2d 171, 175 (Minn. Ct. App. 1986); accord L.R. Schmaus Co. v. Commissioner, 406 F.2d 1044, 1045 (7th Cir. 1969); Household Reinsurance Co., Ltd., v. Travelers Ins. Co., No. 91 C 1308, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1006 (E.D. Ill. January 31, 1992); See also Pittman v. American Metal Forming Corp., 336 Md. 517, 649 A.2d 356, 363-64 (Md. 1994) (holding that a sole shareholder of a corporation does not breach a fiduciary duty to the corporation when he charges lease prices above fair market value for the property and equipment he leased to his corporation). Even though it does not address this exact issue, we find our Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Snyder v. Freeman instructive in explaining the consequences of a sole shareholder\u2019s actions on the corporation:\nUnder some circumstances, the action of all the shareholders of a close corporation bind the corporation even if the corporation is considered to be a legal entity separate from the shareholders. A corporation is ordinarily bound by acts of its shareholders and directors \u201conly when they act as a body in regular session or under authority conferred at a duly constituted meeting.\u201d Park Terrace, Inc. v. Phoenix Indemnity Co., 241 N.C. 473, 478, 85 S.E. 2d 677, 680 (1955), on rehearing, 243 N.C. 595, 91 S.E. 2d 584 (1956). Nevertheless,\u201c\u2019[t]he contracts of the sole shareholder, or all the shareholders, will bind the corporation in modem law, although not made by the authority of the board of directors, since they are the only persons beneficially interested, aside from corporate creditors. If they do not distinguish between corporate business and their individual affairs, or waive formalities established for their benefit, there is no reason why the courts should insist on such formalities. The contract of the owners of all shares will be regarded as binding on the corporation if so intended.\u2019 \u201d Philadelphia Life Insurance Co. v. Crosland-Cullen Co., 234 F. 2d 780, 783 (4th Cir. 1956), quoting Ballentine on Corporations \u00a7 126, p. 296.\n300 N.C. 204, 210, 266 S.E.2d 593, 597-98 (1980) (footnote omitted). Plaintiffs raise no public policy concerns and there are no alleged corporate creditors. Therefore, even if there is an issue of fact as to whether plaintiff Colbert was a director or president of T-WOL, this is not an issue of material fact because defendant Edmonds as the sole shareholder of T-WOL did not owe a fiduciary duty to the directors or officers of T-WOL and could dispose of the disputed property as he saw fit. Accordingly, plaintiff Colbert\u2019s claims of constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, usurpation of corporate opportunity, and unfair and deceptive trade practices, which were based on defendant Edmond\u2019s alleged breach of fiduciary duty due to the transfer of the disputed property, were properly dismissed by the trial court.\nD. Plaintiff T-WOL\nSince plaintiff Harris has been eliminated by judicial estoppel and plaintiff Colbert has been eliminated because T-WOL has only one shareholder, only claims of plaintiff T-WOL remain. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-3-02(1) (2009) states that a corporation has the power \u201cTo sue and be sued, complain and defend in its corporate name.\u201d However, as defendant Edmonds is the sole shareholder and he did not owe a fiduciary duty to the directors or officers of T-WOL, he also did not owe a fiduciary duty to T-WOL, the corporation, see Freese, 110 N.C. App. at'37, 428 S.E.2d at 847, and, as noted above, could dispose of the disputed real property as he saw fit. Accordingly, plaintiff T-WOL\u2019s claims of constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, usurpation of corporate opportunity, and unfair and deceptive trade practices, which were based on defendant Edmonds alleged breach of fiduciary duty were properly dismissed by the trial court. Given this determination, we also affirm the trial court\u2019s declaration that the transfer of the disputed property from T-WOL to ECDG South, LLC was valid. Additionally, we affirm the transfer of the corporate records to defendant Edmonds as the sole shareholder of T-WOL.\nE. Defendants Clark and ECDG South LLC\nPlaintiffs argue that defendant Clark as the accountant for T-WOL breached his fiduciary duty to T-WOL by intentionally failing to file tax returns and annual reports with the Secretary of State which resulted in T-WOL\u2019s administrative dissolution; defendants Clark and Edmonds subsequently forming ECDG South LLC; and defendant Edmonds transferring the disputed property from the dissolved T-WOL without any consideration to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs\u2019 additional claims for constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, and unfair and deceptive trade practices against defendant Clark are all based on this alleged breach of fiduciary duty. Defendants counter that the forecast of evidence shows that defendant Clark had no duty to T-WOL and the claims against him were properly dismissed.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims against Clark are also based upon the same actions which they claim harmed plaintiff T-WOL, and we have already determined that defendant Edmonds, as sole shareholder, did not owe any duty to either T-WOL or its officers or directors. We are unable to discern how defendant Clark, alleged to be the accountant for T-WOL, could owe any duty to T-WOL above that owed by defendant Edmonds. For the same reasons as discussed above, the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims of breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, constructive fraud, and unfair and deceptive trade practice against defendant Clark.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims against ECDG South, LLC were also properly dismissed as its only role in this lawsuit is that it is the company to which the disputed property was transferred, and as discussed above, that transfer was valid. As we have affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendants, we need not address the parties\u2019 remaining arguments.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\nAFFIRMED.\nJudges ELMORE and STEELMAN concur.\n. Corporate records for T-WOL from 2000 to 2005 show that plaintiff Colbert was elected as a director and later as president, but the parties dispute the validity of these corporate records and elections, as discussed below.\n. For example, the complaint alleges that defendants Edmonds and Clark deliberately failed \u201cto file the appropriate tax returns and annual reports\u201d for T-WOL and that this action \u201cunderscores how Defendants Edmonds and Clark had conspired, against Plaintiffs, over a long period of time, to steal T-WOL\u2019s Property.\u201d There is no allegation that either individual plaintiff has ever had any ownership interest in the disputed property.\n. Plaintiff Harris also concedes that defendant Edmonds was not his attorney in the bankruptcy matter and that he sought counsel from other attorneys before filing his bankruptcy petition.\n. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(1) (2009) requires a debtor seeking bankruptcy protection to file a schedule of assets, liabilities, current income, current expenditures, and a statement of the debtor\u2019s financial affairs. We also note that property of a bankruptcy estate is defined broadly to include: \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1) (2009).\n. \u201cThe duty of disclosure in a bankruptcy proceeding is a continuing one[.]\u201d Browning Mfg. v. Mims (In re Coastal Plains, Inc.), 179 F.3d 197, 208 (5th Cir. 1999) (citation omitted).\n. Actually, the complaint alleged that both plaintiffs Harris and Colbert were simultaneously shareholders of T-WOL when the lawsuit was filed, so that there were three shareholders total, a position which appears to be impossible under the facts alleged.\n. At the summary judgment hearing, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel abandoned their claim for conversion of the contested real property. See Norman, 140 N.C. App. at 414, 537 S.E.2d at 264 (stating that \u201cIn North Carolina, only goods and personal property are properly the subjects of a claim for conversion. A claim for conversion does not apply to real property.\u201d (citation omitted)), disc. review denied, 353 N.C. 378, 547 S.E.2d 13 (2001).\n. The exception to this rule is that controlling or majority shareholders owe a fiduciary duty to minority shareholders in a closely held corporation. See Freese, 110 N.C. App. at 37, 428 S.E.2d at 847. This exception is not at issue in this case because defendant Edmonds is the sole shareholder of T-WOL based on judicial estoppel and was the minority shareholder even without judicial estoppel.\n. Defendants have not raised any arguments regarding the standing of plaintiffs Harris or Colbert to bring this action on behalf of T-WOL and we express no opinion on this issue.", "author": "STROUD, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["T-WOL ACQUISITION COMPANY, INC., TERENCE A.

Murdock Research Institute\u2019s (\u201cDHMRI\u201d) late application for exemption from ad valorem taxes for the year 2008. Based on the following, we affirm the decision of the PTC.\nI. Background\nThe North Carolina Research Campus (\u201cNCRC\u201d) is an educational and scientific biotechnical campus located in Kannapolis, Cabarrus County, North Carolina. The NCRC was established to improve the health and nutrition of people by creating a partnership between both public and private North Carolina universities to study these subjects. The principal laboratory on the NCRC is the David H. Murdock Core Laboratory Building Condominium and DHMRI owns Unit 1 of the Core Laboratory, which is a unique area housing DHMRI\u2019s operations and equipment.\nDHMRI is a private foundation organized under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 509(a)(3), Type I, which supports university-related scientific research. Under North Carolina law, this classification allows DHMRI to be exempt from ad valorem taxes. Furthermore, DHMRI was incorporated with the North Carolina Secretary of State as a non-profit corporation on 30 March 2007. During a three-year span ending in 2005, the County and DHMRI worked together to establish Tax Increment Financing, which provided the County with knowledge of the tax status of DHMRI\u2019s various pieces of property.\nThe beginning of the ad valorem tax year for 2008 was 1 January 2008, which happened to be a reevaluation year. DHMRI\u2019s deadline for filing an application for exemption from ad valorem taxes was 31 January 2008. The County adopted its budget for fiscal year 2008-2009 on 16 June 2008. However, the County had assessed the Core Labor-atory on 8 April 2008 and DHMRI received a tax bill for $449,910.58 on 23 July 2008. The total assessment to Unit 1 of the Core Laboratory, which was still under construction, was $40,170,588.00. On 1 December 2008, DHMRI filed a late application with the County for exemption from ad valorem taxes for the year 2008 pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-278.1, based on it being \u201cfor nonprofit educational, scientific, literary, or charitable purposes\u201d under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-278.7(a)(l) (2011).\nThe Board held a hearing on 10 December 2008 to review DHMRI\u2019s late application. At the hearing, DHMRI allegedly did not attempt to explain the lateness of its application, but merely contended that it was entitled to exemption based on it being a charitable organization. DHMRI, on the other hand, claims that it attempted to present evidence of its reason for lateness, but was interrupted by the County Assessor, who was Clerk to the Board. The County Assessor told the Board that any consideration of the late application could have serious budgetary implications and that he, personally, did not like late applications. Subsequently, on 17 December 2008, the Board notified DHMRI of its denial of DHMRI\u2019s late application. DHMRI then filed its notice of appeal to the PTC on 15 January 2009. On 1 July of that same year, DHMRI received a letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that it had been granted tax exempt status under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 501(c)(3), retroactive to 30 March 2007.\nDHMRI filed its Form AV-14 Application for Hearing with the PTC on 29 November 2010. The County then filed its Motion on 1 February 2011, seeking to have DHMRI\u2019s appeal dismissed. DHMRI filed a response to the Motion to which it attached an affidavit of Gerald A. Newton, analyzing the Board\u2019s handling of late exemption applications for other taxpayers in the County over the previous four years. Mr. Newton had previously served on the Board and was in a position to interpret the Board\u2019s meeting minutes. The PTC held a hearing on 23 March 2011, to address the Motion. At the hearing, the County objected to Mr. Newton\u2019s affidavit based on DHMRI\u2019s failure to attach the minutes of the Board\u2019s meetings reviewed by Mr. Newton. However, it appears from the transcript of the hearing that the PTC summarily overruled the County\u2019s objection without comment. Ultimately, the PTC denied the Motion and stated that it was not referring the case back to the Board for rehearing. On 31 May 2011, Chairman Terry L. Wheeler issued a written final decision on behalf of the PTC, granting DHMRI the exemption. The County filed its notice of appeal to this Court on 30 June 2011.\nII. Analysis\nThe County\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the PTC exceeded its authority by deciding the case on the merits when the sole issue before it at the hearing was the Motion. More specifically, the County contends the hearing was a preliminary hearing and that the issue of whether or not the Board improperly denied DHMRI\u2019s late application should be addressed in a later evidentiary hearing. We disagree.\nThis Court may review a decision from the PTC as provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-345.2(b) (2011), which states:\nThe court may affirm or reverse the decision of the [PTC], declare the same null and void, or remand the case for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantial rights of the appellants have been prejudiced because the [PTC\u2019s] findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:\n(1) In violation of constitutional provisions; or\n(2) In excess of statutory authority or jurisdiction of the [PTC]; or\n(3) Made upon unlawful proceedings; or\n(4) Affected by other errors of law; or\n(5) Unsupported by competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; or\n(6) Arbitrary or capricious.\nMoreover, we must \u201c \u2018review all questions of law de novo and apply the whole record test where the evidence is conflicting to determine if the [PTC\u2019s] decision has any rational basis.\u2019 \u201d In re Appeal of Pavillon Int\u2019l, 166 N.C. App. 194, 197, 601 S.E.2d 307, 308 (2004) (quoting In re Univ. for the Study of Human Goodness & Creative Grp. Work, 159 N.C. App. 85, 88-89, 582 S.E.2d 645, 648 (2003)).\nUnder a de novo review, this Court \u201cconsiders the matter anew and freely substitutes its own judgment for that of the [PTC].\u201d In re Appeal of the Greens of Pine Glen Ltd. Part., 356 N.C. 642, 647, 576 S.E.2d 316, 319 (2003). An appellate court may not replace the [PTC\u2019s] judgment with its own judgment when there are two reasonably conflicting views of the evidence. In re Appeal of Perry-Griffin Foundation, 108 N.C. App. 383, 393, 424 S.E.2d 212, 218 (1993). Instead, when there are two reasonably conflicting results which could be reached, this Court is required,\n\u2018in determining the substantiality of evidence supporting the agency\u2019s decision, to take into account evidence contradictory to the evidence on which the agency decision relies. Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. If the whole record supports the [PTC\u2019s] findings, the decision of the [PTC] must be upheld.\u2019\nPavillon, 166 N.C. App. at 197, 601 S.E.2d at 308 (quoting In re Univ. for the Study of Human Goodness & Creative Grp. Work, 159 N.C. App. at 89, 582 S.E.2d at 648).\nIn re Appeal of Totsland Preschool, Inc., 180 N.C. App. 160, 163, 636 S.E.2d 292, 295 (2006).\nThe [PTC] constitutes the State Board of Equalization and Review for the valuation and taxation of property in the State. It shall hear appeals from the appraisal and assessment of the property of public service companies as provided in G.S. 105-333. The [PTC] may adopt rules needed to fulfill its duties.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-288(b) (2011). Under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-282.1(a) (2011), \u201c[e]very owner of property claiming exemption or exclusion from property taxes under the provisions of this Subchapter has the burden of establishing that the property is entitled to it[,]\u201d and \u201cmust file an application for the exemption or exclusion annually during the listing period.\u201d In the case at hand, the listing period ends on 31 January of each calendar year. Owners of property eligible for exemption under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-278.7 must file an application in their initial year of eligibility. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-282.1(a)(2), (a)(2)(a). However,\n[u]pon a showing of good cause by the applicant for failure to make a timely application, an application for exemption or exclusion filed after the close of the listing period may be approved by the Department of Revenue, the board of equalization and review, the board of county commissioners, or the governing body of a municipality, as appropriate. An untimely application for exemption or exclusion approved under this subsection applies only to property taxes levied by the county or municipality in the calendar year in which the untimely application is filed.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-282.1(al) (2011).\nThe County contends the basis for the appeal to the PTC was not whether DHMRI was an exempt organization, but whether the Board abused its discretion in refusing to grant DHMRI\u2019s late exemption application. The PTC may hear appeals from the Board pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-290 (2011). In reviewing the Board\u2019s decision, the PTC must adhere to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-290, as well as its own rules as codified in N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0201 et seq. (April 2011). \u201cThe hearing before the [PTC] is a formal adversarial proceeding conducted under the rules of evidence as applied in the Trial Division of the General Courts of Justice. The North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to proceedings before the [PTC].\u201d N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0209. The County argues that all parties understood the hearing was a motion hearing and, moreover, the. PTC did not require the parties to submit a pretrial order in advance, with copies of exhibits and a list of witnesses, pursuant to N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0213 and -.0214. According to the County, the PTC clearly rules on motions to dismiss in the manner of a motion hearing, In re Louisiana Pacific Corp.,_N.C. App._, 703 S.E.2d 190 (2010), and consequently cannot preemptively decide the entire case.\nOtherwise, the County contends the Motion should be considered as analogous to a Rule 12 motion to dismiss, although the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6), (c) (2011); N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 105-290. In arguing so, the County notes that the purpose of a Rule 12 motion to dismiss is \u201c \u2018to test the legal sufficiency of the pleading against which [the motion] is directed.\u2019 \u201d Eastway Wrecker Serv., Inc. v. City of Charlotte, 165 N.C. App. 639, 647, 599 S.E.2d 410, 415 (2004) (citation omitted), aff'd, 360 N.C. 167, 622 S.E.2d 495 (2005). Ultimately, the County contends the PTC may accept as true DHMRI\u2019s assertions in its Form AV-14, with attachments, in considering the Motion, but it may not make findings of fact which are conclusive on appeal. White v. White, 296 N.C. 661, 667, 252 S.E.2d 698, 702 (1979). As a result, the County claims the PTC overreached its boundaries in summarily deciding the entire case when the only matter before it was the preliminary Motion.\nIn response to the County\u2019s argument that the Motion should have been considered under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12, DHMRI claims the Motion should have been considered as if it were for summary judgment under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56 (2011). Although, the Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply, DHMRI contends the Motion more closely resembles one for summary judgment. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0209; N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56. Where a trial court considers items outside the pleadings, such as affidavits or testimony, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is converted to a motion for summary judgment. Kessing v. Mortgage Corp., 278 N.C. 523, 533, 180 S.E.2d 823, 829 (1971). Moreover, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) states, \u201c[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Thus, DHMRI argues there was no genuine issue of material fact and that it deserved judgment as a matter of law based on its late application being improperly denied. Although the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to the PTC, we do believe the Motion more closely resembles a motion for summary judgment. See N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0209; N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56.\nAdditionally, DHMRI argues the PTC properly followed its administrative and statutory guidelines in ruling in its favor. DHMRI notes that the PTC may, but is not required to hold a prehearing conference to simplify the issues and otherwise expedite the appeal. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0208. Once the appeal was filed the County had twenty days to file an answer. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0212. Nevertheless, the County merely filed its Motion without filing a response. Moreover, each party must file copies of all documents to be reviewed at least ten days before the hearing, while also providing a copy to the opposing party. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0213. Here, DHMRI filed its response to the Motion more than ten days before the hearing and at the hearing the PTC considered the Motion, the request for hearing, and the affidavit filed by DHMRI. Based on all this information, the PTC denied the Motion and entered its final decision in DHMRI\u2019s favor.\nDHMRI goes on to argue that the PTC properly denied the Motion and ruled in DHMRI\u2019s favor because the County failed to contest the facts as presented by DHMRI. In its final decision, the PTC made various findings of fact based on the evidence presented at the hearing by DHMRI. Specifically, Mr. Newton\u2019s affidavit showed that the Board had approved untimely applications in thirteen other meetings in 2008. Consequently, DHMRI contends the PTC\u2019s findings of fact were properly based on competent evidence. Furthermore, DHMRI notes that the County conceded that DHMRI was exempt from the ad valorem taxes. Specifically, in the Motion the County stated that it \u201cdoes not dispute that [DHMRI] is a qualifying exempt organization and that its property would be exempt if a timely application for an exemption were filed.\u201d Based on this admission and the whole record, DHMRI contends the PTC\u2019s final decision was proper and that the hearing process before the Board had been unfair on its behalf.\nIn reviewing the whole record, we must determine whether or not the County was treated fairly throughout the hearing process. Based on the evidence before us, it appears that the County was treated properly in that the PTC appropriately reviewed the materials presented by both parties prior to the hearing and based on competent evidence denied the Motion while entering a final decision in favor of DHMRI. Clearly, the Board\u2019s decision to deny DHMRI\u2019s late application was arbitrary and capricious due to its only feasible reason for denying the application being that DHMRI had received such a large assessment, which the County had already included in its budget for the upcoming year. The County had prior knowledge of DHMRI\u2019s tax exempt status, even before seeking the assessment against DHMRI. Likewise, the Board had allowed late applications at thirteen other meetings in 2008 and there is no reason DHMRI\u2019s application should have been treated any differently. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0101 et seq. does not appear to contemplate the holding of more than one hearing to address an issue regarding a valuation or assessment. See N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 11.0209 (use of language \u201c[t]he hearing\u201d indicates holding of only one hearing). Thus, we cannot see that the County was prejudiced through the holding of one hearing to address all matters, as the evidence was clearly in DHMRI\u2019s favor. Consequently, we affirm the decision of the PTC in denying the Motion and reversing the Board\u2019s decision regarding DHMRI\u2019s late application.\nAffirmed.\nChief Judge MARTIN and Judge BRYANT concur.", "author": "McCullough, judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["IN THE MATTTER OF: APPEAL OF: David H.

Lewis (\u201cplaintiff\u2019) appeals from the trial court\u2019s 19 July 2011 order denying her partial motion for summary judgment and granting Edward Lee Rapp\u2019s (\u201cdefendant\u201d) motion for summary judgment. After careful review, we affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.\nBackground\nIn April 2010, plaintiff was the serving Senior Resident Judge of Judicial District 13B in North Carolina and was engaged in a campaign to retain her seat in the November 2010 election. She was also a vocal supporter of William Rab\u00f3n who was running for the North Carolina State Senate. Defendant, a citizen of North Carolina, was a known supporter of Rabon\u2019s opponent, Bettie Fennell. Defendant also volunteered to serve as Fennell\u2019s \u201cMedia Strategist\u201d without receiving compensation.\nOn 9 April 2010, defendant posted a blog entry on Facebook titled \u201cDirty Politics by the good ol boys.\u201d The blog entry was also posted on Carolina Talk Network. In this post, defendant criticized Rab\u00f3n and further stated: \u201cWhen sitting judges campaign for a candidate, in clear violation of the seventh canon of the NC Code of Judicial conduct^] [w]e are clearly into dirty politics\u201d (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe 9 April publication\u201d). That same day, plaintiff\u2019s attorney emailed defendant and informed him that plaintiff was a candidate for office and that Canon 7B(2) of the Code of Judicial Conduct allows a candidate to endorse any other candidate seeking election to any office. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney also cited a memorandum issued by Chief Judge John Martin on 26 February 2010 in which he reiterated to members of the judiciary what conduct was permissible and what conduct was prohibited by the Code of Judicial Conduct during the 2010 election cycle. The memorandum specifically cited to Canon 7B(2) and stated that a judge was permitted to endorse any candidate seeking office so long as the judge is also a judicial candidate.\nOn 12 April 2010, defendant posted another blog entry on Facebook and Carolina Talk Network titled: \u201cApologies, Corrections, Explanations and Amplifications on my Blogs.\u201d Defendant stated in pertinent part:\nI have spent this past weekend in prayer, mediation [sic], and contemplation. . . . First, let me apologize for my comment about the sitting judge being in violation [of] The North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct. I was wrong. This can be done only by proper disciplinary proceedings and I have neither right nor authority to make that judgment and will let the proper authorities make that determination, if and when, it is brought before them. I have read, top to bottom, The North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct and have voiced my opinion based on the pertinent articles provided in appendix 1 at the end of this blog. I also solicited the opinion of a friend of mine who happens to be an attorney. We both agreed that there is probable cause for such action. Read the appendix and make up your own mind. ... It is my belief that for any Republican office holder to campaign openly for any candidate in a primary is wrong. Office holders cannot appear to be private citizens. The power and authority of their office precludes this.\n(hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe 12 April publication\u201d) (Emphasis omitted). Defendant included portions of the Code of Judicial Conduct in the appendix to his blog entry; however, he did not include Canon 7B(2).\nOn 14 April 2010, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that defendant\u2019s publications were libelous per se because the false accusations damaged plaintiff\u2019s reputation as a judge. Plaintiff sought monetary damages as well as a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction.\nAfter discovery was complete, defendant moved for summary judgment on 3 February 2011. On 9 June 2011, plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment, asking the trial court to enter judgment \u201cas a matter of law as to Defendant\u2019s words constituting libel per se.\u201d On 19 July 2011, the trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff timely appealed to this Court.\nDiscussion\nPlaintiff argues on appeal that the trial court erred in denying her motion for partial summary judgment and granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. \u201cOur standard of review of an appeal from summary judgment is de novo; such judgment is appropriate only when the record shows that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d In re Will of Jones, 362 N.C. 569, 573, 669 S.E.2d 572, 576 (2008) (quoting Forbis v. Neal, 361 N.C. 519, 524, 649 S.E.2d 382, 385 (2007)). Consequently, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant did not commit libel per se in the 9 April and 12 April publications.\n\u201cIn order to recover for defamation, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant caused injury to the plaintiff by making false, defamatory statements of or concerning the plaintiff, which were published to a third person.\u201d Boyce & Isley, PLLC v. Cooper, 153 N.C. App. 25, 29, 568 S.E.2d 893, 897 (2002).\nIn North Carolina, the term defamation applies to the two distinct torts of libel and slander. Libel per se is \u201ca publication which, when considered alone without explanatory circumstances: (1) charges that a person has committed an infamous crime; (2) charges a person with having an infectious disease; (3) tends to impeach a person in that person\u2019s trade or profession; or (4) otherwise tends to subject one to ridicule, contempt or disgrace.\u201d\nId. at 29, 568 S.E.2d at 898 (quoting Phillips v. Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ., 117 N.C. App. 274, 277, 450 S.E.2d 753, 756 (1994), disc. review denied, 340 N.C. 115, 456 S.E.2d 318 (1995)). \u201cWhether a publication is libelous per se is a question of law for the court.\u201d Id. at 31, 568 S.E.2d at 899.\n\u201c[I]n order to be libelous per se, defamatory words \u2018must be susceptible of but one meaning and of such nature that the court can presume as a matter of law that they tend to disgrace and degrade the party or hold him up to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or cause him to be shunned and avoided.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 30-31, 568 S.E.2d at 898-99 (quoting Flake v. News Co., 212 N.C. 780, 786, 195 S.E. 55, 60 (1938)) (emphasis added). \u201cWhen examining an allegedly defamatory statement, the court must view the words within their full context and interpret them \u2018as ordinary people would understand\u2019 them.\u201d Id. at 31, 568 S.E.2d at 899 (quoting Renwick v. News and Observer and Renwick v. Greensboro News, 310 N.C. 312, 319, 312 S.E.2d 405, 409, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 858, 83 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1984)).\n\u201cIn actions for defamation, the nature or status of the parties involved is a significant factor in determining the applicable legal standards.\u201d Proffitt v. Greensboro News & Record, 91 N.C. App. 218, 221, 371 S.E.2d 292, 293 (1988). \u201c[T]he First Amendment sets limits on a public figure\u2019s ability to recover for defamation.\u201d Wells v. Liddy, 186 F.3d 505, 532 (4th Cir. 1999). Varner v. Bryan, 113 N.C. App. 697, 703, 440 S.E.2d 295, 299 (1994) (emphasis added) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen a defamation action brought by a \u2018public official\u2019 is at the summary judgment stage, the appropriate question for the trial judge is whether the evidence presented is sufficient to allow a jury to find that actual malice had been shown with convincing clarity.\u201d Id. at 704, 440 S.E.2d at 299.\nWhere the plaintiff is a public official and the allegedly defamatory statement concerns his official conduct, he must prove that the statement was made with actual malice \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. The rule requiring public officials to prove actual malice is based on First Amendment principles and reflects the Court\u2019s consideration of our national commitment to robust and wide-open debate of public issues.\nIt is important to acknowledge that \u201cevidence of personal hostility does not constitute evidence of \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u201d Id. at 704, 440 S.E.2d at 300. Additionally, \u201creckless [disregard] is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have investigated before publishing. There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731, 20 L. Ed. 2d 262, 267 (1968).\nA. 9 April Publication\nWe will first address the 9 April publication, which plaintiff contends was libelous per se and disseminated with actual malice. Defendant admits that this publication contained the false statement that plaintiff was in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, but defendant argues that plaintiff cannot forecast any evidence that defendant acted with actual malice, an essential element of her claim. We agree with defendant.\nDefendant claims that he did not have actual knowledge at the time of the publication that plaintiff was a candidate for office and therefore permitted by the Code of Judicial Conduct to endorse another candidate running for office. Defendant claims that he believed the statement he made to be true when he made it. There is no evidence to show otherwise. Defendant was consistent in his deposition, stating that he did not know that plaintiff was a candidate for office when he wrote the 9 April publication. Plaintiff claims that defendant should have known that she was running for reelection because she was recognized, along with the other candidates, at the Brunswick County Republican Party executive committee meeting on 8 April 2010. Defendant was in attendance at that meeting. While plaintiff is correct in stating that the information was made public and perhaps defendant should have known that she was a candidate, plaintiff has failed to show actual knowledge. Consequently, we are left with only defendant\u2019s assertions in his depositions that he did not, in fact, have actual knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s candidacy.\nPlaintiff has also failed to show that defendant acted with reckless disregard of the truth. Again, defendant consistently stated that he was unaware that plaintiff was running for office. Undoubtedly, defendant could have conducted some research before making his false assertions in the 9 April blog entry; nevertheless, it appears from all accounts that defendant believed that plaintiff was a sitting judge and not running for office. As such, defendant in this case may have acted negligently when publishing the blog entry, but there is no evidence that he acted maliciously. See Varner, 113 N.C. App. at 705, 440 S.E.2d at 300 (rejecting \u201cplaintiffs contention that \u2019actual malice\u2019 may be shown by evidence that defendants failed to avail themselves of available means for ascertaining the falsity of the statements\u201d). Despite plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendant should have known that she was a candidate for office, plaintiff is unable to show, by reference to any materials obtained during discovery, that defendant \u201cin fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of [the] publication.\u201d St. Amant, 390 U.S. at 731, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 267 (holding that evidence that the defendant did not verify the truth of his statements was insufficient to prove that the defendant acted with reckless disregard).\nIn sum, it is undisputed that defendant made false statements about plaintiff in the 9 April publication. However, plaintiff has failed to forecast any evidence that defendant acted with actual knowledge or reckless disregard with \u201cconvincing clarity.\u201d Varner, 113 N.C. App. at 704, 440 S.E.2d at 299. In other words, there is no issue of material fact with regard to actual malice.\nB. 12 April Publication\nNext, we address the 12 April publication, which plaintiff contends was also libelous per se. Plaintiff claims that defendant was still accusing her of being in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, as he did in the 9 April publication. Defendant argues that he did not affirm the false statement that was present in the 9 April publication; rather, he informed his readers that he incorrectly stated that plaintiff was in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct in his 9 April publication and he was merely asserting his opinion that \u201cprobable cause\u201d existed for the \u201cproper authorities\u201d to take disciplinary action against plaintiff.\nThe pivotal question then is whether defendant\u2019s statement was a constitutionally protected opinion. \u201cWhether a statement constitutes fact or opinion is a question of law for the trial court to decide. Like all questions of law, it is subject to de novo review on appeal.\u201d Potomac Valve & Fitting Inc. v. Crawford Fitting Co., 829 F.2d 1280, 1285 n.12 (4th Cir. 1987) (internal citations omitted). \u201cPolitical speech regarding a public election lies at the core of matters of public concern protected by the First Amendment.\u201d Wiggins v. Lowndes County, 363 F.3d 387, 390 (5th Cir. 2004). \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has held that statements of opinion relating to matters of public concern which do not contain provable false connotations are constitutionally protected.\u201d Gaunt v. Pittaway, 135 N.C. App. 442, 448, 520 S.E.2d 603, 608 (1999) (citing Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 111 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1990)). In other words, \u201c[r]hetorical hyperbole and expressions of opinion not asserting provable facts are protected speech.\u201d Daniels v. Metro Magazine Holding Co., L.L.C., 179 N.C. App. 533, 539, 634 S.E.2d 586, 590 (2006), appeal dismissed and disc. review denied, 361 N.C. 692, 654 S.E.2d 251 (2007). \u201cIn determining whether a statement can be reasonably interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual, courts look to the circumstances in which the statement is made.\u201d Id. \u201cSpecifically, we consider whether the language used is loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language, as well as the general tenor of the article.\u201d Id. at 540, 634 S.E.2d at 590 (citation and quotation marks omitted).\nEven \u201cwhere a statement of \u2018opinion\u2019 on a matter of public concern reasonably implies false and defamatory facts regarding public figures or officials,\u201d the public figure must still establish the existence of actual malice. Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 20, 111 L. Ed. 2d at 19. Therefore, we must determine whether defendant\u2019s statement was merely an opinion on a matter of public concern. If it was, then defendant is not liable for defamation and the inquiry ends. If, however, defendant disseminated a false, defamatory statement about plaintiff that was not an opinion, then we must still determine whether defendant acted with actual malice.\nBefore addressing whether defendant was asserting an opinion, we will first determine whether defendant\u2019s statement was susceptible to more than one interpretation and whether the statement was damaging to plaintiff. Upon review of the 12 April publication in context, there is only one logical interpretation \u2014 defendant was still attempting to convince the readers that plaintiff was in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct when she supported Rabon\u2019s campaign. Defendant admitted in the 12 April publication that he was not in a position to make the ultimate determination that plaintiff had violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, and he apologized for reaching that ultimate determination in the 9 April publication. Nevertheless, defendant continued to lodge the same accusation in the 12 April publication as he presented in the 9 April publication \u2014 that plaintiff was in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. This accusation undoubtedly tended to impeach plaintiff in her trade or profession since it accused her, a sitting judge, of violating the Code of Judicial Conduct that she had sworn to uphold. Cohen v. McLawhorn,_ N.C. App._,_, 704 S.E.2d 519, 527 (2010) (\u201cNorth Carolina has long recognized the harm that can result from false statements that impeach a person in that person\u2019s trade or profession \u2014 such statements are deemed defamation per se.\u201d).\nNext, we will determine whether the accusation was a constitutionally protected opinion. It is undisputed that defendant\u2019s statement in the 12 April publication constituted political speech regarding a public election. Plaintiff strictly contends that defendant\u2019s statement contained provable false connotations and did not, therefore, constitute an opinion. We hold that defendant\u2019s 12 April publication contained provable false connotations and was not defendant\u2019s subjective opinion.\nAlthough defendant expressly stated that it was his opinion that plaintiff had violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, an individual \u201ccannot preface an otherwise defamatory statement with \u2018in my opinion\u2019 and claim immunity from liability!.]\u201d Daniels, 179 N.C. App. at 539, 634 S.E.2d at 590. Defendant claimed in the 12 April publication that he had read the Code of Judicial Conduct from \u201ctop to bottom\u201d and it was his \u201copinion\u201d that \u201cprobable cause\u201d existed for the \u201cproper authorities\u201d to take \u201caction.\u201d Defendant was aware at that point that plaintiff was a candidate for judicial office. Having read the Code of Judicial Conduct from \u201ctop to bottom,\u201d he was also aware that as a candidate for office, plaintiff was permitted to campaign on behalf of another candidate pursuant to Canon 7B(2). Defendant had been told by plaintiff\u2019s attorney that Chief Judge Martin had issued a memorandum in which he stated that a sitting judge seeking reelection was permitted to campaign for any other candidate. Whether plaintiff was, in fact, in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct could be easily investigated and proven false. Defendant ignored the proof that plaintiff was not in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct and chose to assert a provable false accusation against plaintiff.\nMoreover, defendant included portions of the Code of Judicial Conduct in the appendix to his blog entry so that his readers could \u201cmake up [their] own mind[s]\u201d; however, he did not include Canon 7B(2), which exonerates plaintiff of any wrongdoing. Defendant did, however, include Canon 7B(1), which, if read in isolation, would indicate that a judge may not endorse a political candidate. The inclusion of Canon 7B(1), coupled with the exclusion of Canon 7B(2), can only be perceived as a deliberate attempt by defendant to substantiate the false accusation contained in the publication. \u201cEven if the speaker states the facts upon which he bases his opinion, if those facts are either incorrect or incomplete, or if his assessment of them is erroneous, the statement may still imply a false assertion of fact.\u201d Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 18-19, 111 L. Ed. 2d at 18; see Moldea v. New York Times Co., 15 F.3d 1137, 1144 (\u201cJust as a speaker is not immunized from liability simply by prefacing otherwise defamatory statements with the words \u2018In my opinion . . .,\u2019 defamatory assessments based on incorrect \u2018facts\u2019 stated by the speaker are also actionable.\u201d), aff\u2019d as modified, 22 F.3d 310 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\nNot only did defendant attempt to mislead the readers by failing to attach Canon 7B(2), he also stated that he had discussed the matter with his friend, an attorney, and they agreed that there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d for disciplinary action to be taken by the proper authorities. Defendant was clearly trying to bolster the validity of his false accusation by asserting that someone with expertise in the field of law concurred with his assessment. See Action Repair, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., Inc., 776 F.2d 143, 147 (7th Cir. 1985) (acknowledging that a statement by a judge in support of an allegedly defamatory comment was more prejudicial \u201cthan similar speculation from multitudes of anonymous lay people\u201d because the judge is perceived as an expert in legal matters).\nIn sum, defendant\u2019s 12 April publication was framed as an opinion; however, it presented the same false accusations that were contained in the 9 April publication. Defendant attempted to convince the readers of the publication that plaintiff was in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct by claiming that he had read the Code of Judicial Conduct from \u201ctop to bottom\u201d; supplying only the portion of the Code of Judicial Conduct that would support his accusation; and claiming that an attorney agreed with his assessment. We hold that plaintiff\u2019s accusation in the 12 April publication was subject to one interpretation; that the accusation was defamatory; and that the accusation was not a constitutionally protected opinion. It was, therefore, defamation per se as a matter of law.\nStill, plaintiff must show that defendant acted with actual malice. \u201c[T]hat is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d Varner, 113 N.C. App. at 703, 440 S.E.2d at 299 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff was unable to do so with regard to the 9 April publication. We hold that sufficient evidence was forecast by plaintiff to show that defendant acted with knowledge, or at the least with reckless disregard, of the falsity of his 12 April publication. Defendant claimed that he was unaware that plaintiff was running for reelection when he wrote the 9 April publication. He further claimed that since he thought she was a sitting judge who was not running for reelection, she was in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. In essence, defendant\u2019s only defense with regard to the 9 April publication was that he did not know that plaintiff was running for office. Defendant could no longer claim ignorance on 12 April after he had been informed that plaintiff was, in fact, running for reelection. At that time he knew that plaintiff was a candidate and that according to Canon 7B(2) she was permitted to support another candidate. Nevertheless, defendant sought to convince the readers of his blog that plaintiff was in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. The evidence tends to establish that he acted, at the very least, with reckless disregard, i.e., he entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication. We hold that \u201cthe evidence presented is sufficient to allow a jury to find that actual malice ha[s] been shown with convincing clarity.\u201d Id. We hold that a genuine issue of material fact existed for jury determination with regard to actual malice.\nConclusion\nBased on the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with regard to the 9 April publication. We hold that the trial court erred in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with regard to the 12 April publication. We reverse and remand for entry of partial summary judgment for plaintiff because the 12 April publication constituted libel per se as a matter of law. The issue of actual malice and damages is left for jury determination.\nAffirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.\nJudges THIGPEN and McCULLOUGH concur.\n. We note that defendant did express an opinion when he stated: \u201cIt is my belief that for any Republican office holder to campaign openly for any candidate in a primary is wrong. Office holders cannot appear to be private citizens. The power and authority of their office precludes this.\u201d This statement, unlike the accusation that plaintiff was in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, cannot be proven true or false. Defendant is entitled to his opinion that it is \u201cwrong,\u201d or even unethical, for an office holder to campaign for a candidate. An opinion that a judge has acted unethically is quite different from an accusation that a judge has committed an act that could potentially lead to official disciplinary action.", "author": "HUNTER, Robert C., Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["OLA M.

Gallop, for defendant-appellee.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "McCullough, Judge.\nJ. Reed Fisher, et al., (collectively \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) appeal from the trial court\u2019s granting of the Town of Nags Head\u2019s (\u201cdefendant\u2019s\u201d) motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to N.C.R. Civ. P. 12(c) (2011). For the reasons discussed herein, we affirm the order of the trial court.\nI. Background\nPlaintiffs are oceanfront property owners along the Atlantic Ocean in Nags Head, North Carolina. Defendant has proposed a onetime beach nourishment project (the \u201cproject\u201d) over a ten-mile stretch, which would affect plaintiffs\u2019 properties. The project would involve the depositing of additional sand on the beach with a projected advancement in the shoreline of \u201canywhere from 50 to 125 feet.\u201d\nOn 14 January 2011, plaintiffs received correspondence (the \u201ccorrespondence\u201d) from defendant seeking a voluntary easement across their respective properties for the implementation of the project. The correspondence threatened to obtain the easements by eminent domain should plaintiffs not voluntarily sign the request. It purported to also be a notice of condemnation pursuant to Chapter 40A of the North Carolina General Statutes. The notice aspect of the correspondence, in relevant part, states:\nIt is critical that you sign the easement. The project\u2019s success relies on a stable, continuous deposit of sand. If you do not sign the enclosed easement and return it by February 18, 2011, you are hereby notified pursuant to North Carolina General Statute 40A-40 that the Town intends to condemn, by eminent domain, the necessary easement rights. The Town estimates that no compensation to the owners is required for the interest sought. The Town will file a condemnation action for the easement area on your property as soon as practical after said date. The condemnation action would be for a purpose as to which title to the easement interest would immediately vest in the Town when the complaint is filed to institute the action to condemn, pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes 40A-42.\nYou have the right to file for injunctive relief and to answer the complaint after it has been filed. You should consult with an attorney regarding your rights.\nPlaintiffs contend the voluntary easement, on its face, would have transferred rights to defendant over and beyond those necessary for the project or that otherwise could be lawfully obtained through eminent domain. On 16 February 2Q11, two days before the date to return the request for voluntary easement, plaintiffs initiated the present suit seeking to enjoin defendant in advance of its exercise of eminent domain. The complaint alleges insufficiencies in the notice and violations of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. The complaint also asserted a class action, but plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew the Motion to Certify Class. Defendant subsequently filed its motions to dismiss and strike, as well as its answer, on 21 March 2011. Defendant also filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on 24 March 2011, pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. The trial court held a hearing on the motion on 25 April 2011 and ultimately granted the motion by order dated 2 June 2011. Plaintiffs appeal.\nII. Analysis\nAt issue in this case is whether the trial court correctly granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to N.C.R. Civ. P. 12(c). Specifically, plaintiffs contend their constitutional rights were violated by defendant\u2019s failing to offer just compensation for the voluntary easements and that defendant\u2019s notice was otherwise deficient. We disagree.\nWe review the granting of a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) de novo. Toomer v. Branch Banking & Tr. Co., 171 N.C. App. 58, 66, 614 S.E.2d 328, 335 (2005). As in a 12(b)(6) motion, our Court \u201cmust accept the allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as true.\u201d Thompson v. Town of Warsaw, 120 N.C. App. 471, 473, 462 S.E.2d 691, 692 (1995). The granting of a motion for judgment on the pleadings is proper where the pleadings fail to reveal any material issue of fact with only questions of law remaining. Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. 130, 137, 209 S.E.2d 494, 499 (1974). Furthermore, it \u201cis not favored by law and the trial court is required to view the facts and permissible inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\u201d Carpenter v. Carpenter, 189 N.C. App. 755, 762, 659 S.E.2d 762, 767 (2008). \u201cThe rule\u2019s function is to dispose of baseless claims or defenses when the formal pleadings reveal their lack of merit.\u201d Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499.\nPlaintiffs raise an initial issue that the trial court and this Court should not consider the exhibits attached to defendant\u2019s answer because it is well-settled that \u201ca document attached to the moving party\u2019s pleading may not be considered in connection with a Rule 12(c) motion unless the non-moving party has made admissions regarding the document.\u201d Weaver v. Saint Joseph of the Pines, Inc., 187 N.C. App. 198, 205, 652 S.E.2d 701, 708 (2007). If the trial court considered matters outside 'the pleadings in reaching its decision, defendant\u2019s motion could not be disposed of under Rule 12(c), \u201cbut rather was converted into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56.\u201d Id. at 205, 652 S.E.2d at 707. However, we cannot tell from the pleadings, or the trial court\u2019s order, whether or not the trial court incorrectly considered the exhibits attached to defendant\u2019s answer, other than the correspondence attached as Exhibit 1 which plaintiffs made admissions to in their complaint. \u201cThe trial court is not required to specify its reason for allowing a motion for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d Wilson v. Development Co., 276 N.C. 198, 207, 171 S.E.2d 873, 879 (1970). Thus, we shall not, and the trial court correctly did not, consider the other exhibits attached to defendant\u2019s answer. We will, therefore, address this case as the trial court\u2019s granting of a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings.\nPlaintiffs first argue defendant violated their constitutional rights by failing to offer just compensation for the proposed voluntary easements. \u201cWhen private property is taken for public use, just compensation must be paid. . . . While the principle is not stated in express terms in the North Carolina Constitution, it is regarded as an integral part of the law of the land within the meaning of Art. I, Sec. 17.\u201d Sale v. Highway Commission, 242 N.C. 612, 617, 89 S.E.2d 290, 295 (1955) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Consequently, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-42(a)(2), (f) (2011), to enjoin defendant from taking their private property without offering just compensation. A party may seek injunctive relief prior to the bringing of an action for condemnation where there is a deficient notice. Nelson v. Town of Highlands, 358 N.C. 210, 210, 594 S.E.2d 21, 22 (2004), adopting dissenting opinion in, 159 N.C. App. 393, 583 S.E.2d 313 (2003) (Hudson, J. dissenting). A notice for condemnation\nshall contain a general description of the property to be taken and of the amount estimated by the condemnor to be just compensation for the property to be condemned. The notice shall also state the purpose for which the property is being condemned and the date condemnor intends to file the complaint.\n(b) In the case of a condemnation action to be commenced pursuant to G.S. 40A-42(a), the notice required by subsection (a) of this section shall substantially comply with the following requirements:\n(1) The notice shall be printed in at least 12 point bold legible type.\n(2) The words \u201cNotice of condemnation\u201d or similar words shall conspicuously appear on the notice.\n(3) The notice shall include the information required by subsection (a) of this section.\n(4) The notice shall contain a plain language summary of the owner\u2019s rights, including:\na. The right to commence an action for injunctive relief.\nb. The right to answer the complaint after it has been filed.\n(5) The notice shall include a statement advising the owner to consult with an attorney regarding the owner's rights.\nAn owner is entitled to no relief because of any defect or inaccuracy in the notice unless the owner was actually prejudiced by the defect or inaccuracy, and the owner is otherwise entitled to relief under Rules 55(d) or 60(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable law.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-40 (2011). This statute must be strictly construed. State v. Club Properties, 275 N.C. 328, 336, 167 S.E.2d 385, 390 (1969). Plaintiffs contend the notice failed to give a reasonable estimate of just compensation, a reasonable notice of the condemnation, a proper description of the property to be taken, and that otherwise plaintiffs suffered prejudice.\nThe law regarding just compensation \u201cimposes upon a governmental agency taking or appropriating private property for public use a correlative duty to make just compensation to the owner of the property appropriated.\u201d Sale, 242 N.C. at 617, 89 S.E.2d at 295. Furthermore, \u201c[i]n this State when a person has been deprived of his private property for public use nothing short of actual payment, or its equivalent, constitutes just compensation.\u201d Id. at 618, 89 S.E.2d at 296. Plaintiffs rely on this statement for the contention that defendant\u2019s estimate of no compensation is inadequate and ludicrous because a monetary value is always necessary. However, we cannot find any case law requiring the providing of monetary compensation and moreover, the statement from above includes the language, \u201cor its equivalent.\u201d Id. Defendant argues plaintiffs are not entitled to monetary compensation due to the benefits plaintiffs will receive from the additional expanse of beach resulting from the project. We believe the value of the additional land could be considered an equivalent to \u201cactual payment.\u201d Id. Nonetheless, the correct value of just compensation is an issue more adequately resolved in the condemnation proceeding and not for the preliminary injunctive issues of whether the notice was sufficient. Thus, we believe plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a lack of monetary compensation warrants injunctive relief is misplaced as the case law allowing a claim for injunctive relief seems to apply to situations involving deficient notice and other allegations. See Nelson, 159 N.C. App. at 394, 583 S.E.2d at 314, overruled on other grounds by 358 N.C. 210, 594 S.E.2d 21 (2004). As a result, we will turn to the issue of whether or not defendant provided sufficient notice as that is plaintiffs\u2019 other significant argument.\nPlaintiffs contend any issues regarding the sufficiency of defendant\u2019s notice are issues of fact adequate to survive a Rule 12(c) motion and better left for a jury to resolve. However, we believe the issue of whether or not defendant satisfied the notice requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-40 is a question of law for us to interpret. Plaintiffs first take issue with defendant\u2019s estimate of just compensation for the property to be condemned. They argue defendant is required to give an estimate and constitutionally required to provide just compensation. Club Properties, 275 N.C. at 334, 167 S.E.2d at 388. In arguing so, plaintiffs claim that an estimate of zero does not constitute an estimate at all. Furthermore, they allege \u201cthe Town has not obtained appraisals of the property rights to be acquired or otherwise estimated fair market value.\u201d Nevertheless, we see no authority requiring that defendant obtain appraisals prior to giving its estimate of just compensation to satisfy the notice requirement. Defendant is within its rights to estimate that it does not owe plaintiffs monetary compensation due to the benefits plaintiffs will receive from the project. Otherwise, the issue is one for a jury to resolve in the condemnation proceedings. This Court has addressed the sufficiency of the notice pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-40 in two cases and in neither have we held that defendant\u2019s estimate must be reasonable in plaintiffs\u2019 eyes. See Scotland County v. Johnson, 131 N.C. App. 765, 769, 509 S.E.2d 213, 215-16 (1998); Catawba Cty. v. Wyant, 197 N.C. App. 533, 541, 677 S.E.2d 567, 572-73 (2009). We believe the issue of whether the estimate of just compensation is proper is better left to the condemnation hearing and as a result we hold that defendant\u2019s estimate of no compensation adequately satisfies the notice requirement.\nPlaintiffs next argue defendant did not provide sufficient notice of its intent to condemn the property should plaintiffs decline to sign the requests for voluntary easement. The alleged notice was provided on the second page of the correspondence within a paragraph set off in boldface type. The notice properly cites to the statute regarding the condemnation procedure. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-42. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-40(b)(2), however, requires that \u201c[t]he words \u2018Notice of condemnation\u2019 or similar words shall conspicuously appear on the notice.\u201d While the words were not on the first page in capital letters, the second page did contain in boldface type the language, \u201cyou are hereby notified pursuant to North Carolina General Statute 40A-40 that the Town intends to condemn, by eminent domain, the necessary easement rights.\u201d Moreover, plaintiffs seem to have understood the notice by filing this action for injunctive relief on 16 February 2011, two days before the 18 February 2011 deadline after which the condemnation action would be filed. Plaintiffs additionally argue that they were prejudiced by the inconspicuousness of the notice in arguing that defendant\u2019s \u201creal purpose [was] to coerce Plaintiffs into conveying property rights without being paid for those rights[.]\u201d Although the notice may not have been as conspicuous as required by the statute, we cannot find that plaintiffs were prejudiced by the notice being on the second page as they were able to ascertain its meaning and file this action prior to the deadline.\nPlaintiffs also argue the notice was deficient in that it lacked a proper description of the property to be taken. The general description provided in the notice described the property as that which \u201clies waterward of the following locations, whichever is most waterward: the Vegetation Line; the toe of the Frontal Dune or Primary Dune; or the Erosion Escarpment of the Frontal Dune or Primary Dune.\u201d Furthermore, attached to the correspondence was a document describing the \u201cEasement Area\u201d and referring plaintiffs to N.C. Admin. Code tit. 15A, r. 07H.0305 (2011), which defines the terms used in the general description. The correspondence also referred to the PIN Number and Tax Parcel for each plaintiffs\u2019 particular piece of property.\nPlaintiffs contend the notice must either describe the property with specificity or reference must be made to a survey. In re Simmons, 5 N.C. App. 81, 85, 167 S.E.2d 857, 860 (1969). In Simmons this Court held that the description \u201cmust be such that a surveyor could locate the parcel described without the aid of extrinsic evidence.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). It is difficult to describe a piece of property with speci ficity which can change with the fluctuation of the tides, but the description of the \u201cEasement Area\u201d utilizes terms that are well defined in the referenced portion of the Administrative Code, such that a surveyor with experience in oceanfront properties could accurately determine the \u201cEasement Area.\u201d The seaward boundary has been determined to be the \u201cmean high water mark,\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 77-20(a) (2011), and can be located by natural indicators and observation. Webb v. N.C. Dept. of Envir., Health, and Nat. Resources, 102 N.C. App. 767, 771-72, 404 S.E.2d 29, 32 (1991). Due to the peculiarity of dealing with oceanfront property, we believe defendant\u2019s description of the \u201cEasement Area\u201d was sufficient for plaintiffs to determine the requested property, or at least for a hired surveyor to locate.\nPlaintiffs make one final argument in regard to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-40, in that they were actually prejudiced by defendant\u2019s deficiencies in the notice. Plaintiffs first make the same argument as above that the lack of just compensation caused them to be prejudiced, but this cannot be the case as they will have the opportunity to litigate the issue at the condemnation hearing. Plaintiffs next raise another similar argument as above, that potential plaintiffs who actually signed the voluntary easement request without defendant having provided an appraisal were prejudiced because defendant coerced those plaintiffs into thinking their potential loss in property contained no value. Unfortunately, as stated above, we believe this argument is meritless, mainly due to the fact that these \u201cpotential\u201d plaintiffs are not involved in the current action and we cannot take their situations into consideration. Plaintiffs finally claim that defendant\u2019s deficient description of the property left them with little choice but to file the current action because they could not tell which property defendant intended to take. Again, this argument is completely meritless. We have already held the description to be sufficient. Consequently, plaintiffs\u2019 claims of prejudice are dismissed.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that defendant has no right or standing to assert public trust rights. \u201cThe public trust doctrine is a common law principle providing that certain land associated with bodies of water is held in trust by the State for the benefit of the public.\u201d Fabrikant v. Currituck Cty., 174 N.C. App. 30, 41, 621 S.E.2d 19, 27 (2005). Thus, plaintiffs contend that the State, in its sovereign capacity, and not defendant, may assert rights in private property by means of the public trust doctrine. Id. However, plaintiffs neglect to consider N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-3(bl)(10) (2011), when contending that the public trust doctrine prevents defendant from asserting any rights of eminent domain over the beaches. Our General Assembly has authorized oceanfront municipalities to exercise the power of eminent domain when\n[e]ngaging in or participating with other governmental entities in acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, extending, or otherwise building or improving beach erosion control or flood and hurricane protection works, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of any property that may be required as a source for beach renourishment.\nId. Consequently, the State has granted defendant the authority to assert its eminent domain powers over certain parts of plaintiffs\u2019 property for the purpose of the project. Furthermore, the public trust doctrine does not preclude defendant from going forth with the project and to the extent defendant argues it has authority to take action under that doctrine, its argument is misplaced. See Town of Nags Head v. Cherry, Inc., No. COA11-93, 2012 WL 540742 (N.C. App. Feb. 21, 2012). Nevertheless, we recognize that the powers of eminent domain constitute a distinct body of law and are routinely exercised by municipalities and other subordinate legal entities.\nIII. Conclusion\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim for injunctive relief fails for two reasons. First, defendant\u2019s decision to estimate that no compensation was required does not violate plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights requiring just compensation because defendant adequately estimated that the benefit received by the project was sufficient compensation and the issue of whether that is reasonable is more properly left for the condemnation hearing. Secondly, defendant\u2019s notice, as provided to plaintiffs, was sufficient to meet the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 40A-40 and otherwise did not prejudice plaintiffs due to their ability to file the current action and have a surveyor accurately locate the requested property. Moreover, defendant has not violated the public trust doctrine by asserting its rights of eminent domain as bequeathed to it by our state legislature. As a result, we affirm the trial court\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).\nAffirmed.\nJudges STEELMAN and GEER concur.", "author": "McCullough, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["J.

Craig Tierney, Jr., for Defendant-Appellee Lambda Chi Alpha, Inc.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "McGEE, Judge.\nPlaintiff was a twenty-one-year-old student at Elon University (Elon) in February 2007 when, tragically, he was involved in an incident that left him paralyzed. Plaintiff had been out with friends on the evening of 2 February 2007 and, around midnight, they ended up at a bar in Burlington. Plaintiff remained at the bar until it closed at 2:00 a.m. on the morning of 3 February 2007. Upon leaving the bar at 2:00 a.m., Plaintiff and three friends started walking to a party one of them had heard about. Before they reached the party, they noticed another party taking place at 211 North Lee Street (the Lee Street house). Plaintiff and his friends decided to check out the party at the Lee Street house, even though they knew nothing about that party, nor who was sponsoring the party. Sometime after entering the Lee Street house, Plaintiff and one of his friends, Mary Kate Kelly (Kelly), entered the bathroom together, locked the door, and started to \u201cmake out.\u201d Plaintiff and Kelly had been in the bathroom about ten minutes when they heard someone knocking on the bathroom door. Neither Plaintiff nor Kelly opened the bathroom door, and the knocking grew louder.\nAccording to Plaintiff, when he and Kelly did exit the bathroom, John Cassady (Cassady) and Clinton Blackburn (Blackburn) immediately confronted Plaintiff. Cassady was a student at Elon, and vice-president of the Delta Pi Chapter (the Chapter) of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity (Lambda Chi and, along with Elon, Defendants). The Chapter is the Elon chapter of Lambda Chi. Blackburn was not a student at Elon, and was not associated with Lambda Chi. Plaintiff testified that Cassady and Blackburn began yelling at him and pushing him. Cassady was a tenant at the Lee Street house and Blackburn was visiting Cassady at the Lee Street house. Blackburn put Plaintiff in a \u201cgrip hold\u201d from behind and started forcing Plaintiff toward the kitchen door exit. According to Plaintiff, before they made it to the door, Blackburn \u201cforcefully pushed\u201d Plaintiff to the floor. After being pushed to the floor, Plaintiff could not move his limbs. Cassady and Blackburn then dragged Plaintiff by his legs out the door. As a result of this incident Plaintiff, tragically, suffered permanent paralysis. Defendants contest some of the facts as presented above, but there is no dispute that Plaintiff was injured as Blackburn and Cassady were forcing him out of the Lee Street house.\nThe Lee Street house was located off the Elon campus and was not owned by Elon, Lambda Chi, or the Chapter. However, it was rented by some members of the Chapter, and apparently had been rented by members of the Chapter for some time. Elon did own the main facility in which the Chapter was located, and that facility was located on the Elon campus. Elon exercises control over certain aspects of \u201cGreek\u201d life on campus, and Elon has promulgated rules and regulations affecting Greek organizations. These regulations include specific protocols that must be followed if a fraternity or sorority desires to serve alcohol at a party conducted on-campus. Defendants recognized, prior to 3 February 2007, that off-campus parties involving fraternities did occur. According to certain national standards, which had been adopted by both Elon and Lambda Chi, dangerous incidents, such as fights or alcohol poisoning, were more likely to occur at off-campus parties. Prior to the 3 February 2007 incident, both Elon and Lambda Chi were aware of violations involving the Chapter, including alcohol violations, hazing, and arrests for marijuana offenses, and some of these incidents occurred off-campus. Defendants expressed concern regarding violations by members of the Chapter, and certain steps were taken to try and remedy those concerns. Both Elon and Lambda Chi had the authority to sanction the Chapter for rules violations.\nPlaintiff brought this action against Defendants, the Chapter, Cassady, Blackburn, and other individuals on 5 June 2008. Plaintiff thereafter filed several amended complaints. Both Elon and Lambda Chi moved for summary judgment on 27 May 2010. The Chapter also moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants by orders dated 30 December 2010. The trial court denied the Chapter\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim. The trial court amended those orders on 28 January 2011, certifying the orders granting summary judgment to Defendants for immediate appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff appeals the orders granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants.\nI. Analysis\nInitially, we note that Plaintiff\u2019s appeal is interlocutory because Plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim against the Chapter remains. However, because the orders from which Plaintiff appeals constitute final judgments with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s claims against Defendants, and because the trial court properly certified the orders for immediate review pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, we review Plaintiff\u2019s appeal. N.C.R. Civ. P. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 54; N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-277 (2011); N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-27 (2011); see also Hoots v. Pryor, 106 N.C. App. 397, 400-01, 417 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1992).\nII. Standard of Review\nA motion for summary judgment is properly granted when\nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\nN.C.G.S. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (1999). A defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of showing either that (1) an essential element of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is nonexistent; (2) the plaintiff is unable to produce evidence which supports an essential element of its claim; or, (3) the plaintiff cannot overcome affirmative defenses raised in contravention of its claims. In ruling on such motion, the trial court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, accepting the latter\u2019s asserted facts as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\nThe purpose of a summary judgment motion is to foreclose the need for a trial when . . . the trial court determines that only questions of law, not fact, are to be decided. Summary judgment may not be used, however, to resolve factual disputes which are material to the disposition of the action.\nCucina v. City of Jacksonville, 138 N.C. App. 99, 101-02, 530 S.E.2d 353, 354-55 (2000) (citations omitted).\nIII. Negligence\nIn order to set out aprima facie claim of negligence against [defendant], plaintiff was required to present evidence tending to show that (1) [defendant] owed a duty to plaintiff; (2) [defendant] breached that duty; (3) such breach constituted an actual and proximate cause of plaintiffs injury; and, (4) plaintiff suffered damages in consequence of the breach.\nId. at 102, 530 S.E.2d at 355 (citation omitted).\nThe dispositive issue in the present case is whether Defendants owed Plaintiff a duty of care. \u201cWhether a defendant owes a plaintiff a duty of care is a question of law.\u201d Davidson v. Univ. of N. C. at Chapel Hill, 142 N.C. App. 544, 552, 543 S.E.2d 920, 925 (2001) (citation omitted). Because we hold that Defendants did not owe Plaintiff a duty of care in this case, we affirm the decisions of the trial court.\nFirst, Plaintiff argues that Defendants owed him a duty of care based upon a theory of voluntary undertaking.\nThe voluntary undertaking theory has been consistently recognized in North Carolina, although it is not always designated as such. See Pinnix, 242 N.C. at 362, 87 S.E.2d at 897 (recognizing that a duty of care \u201cmay arise generally by operation of law under application of the basic rule of the common law which imposes on every person engaged in the prosecution of any undertaking an obligation to use due care\u201d); Davidson and Jones, Inc. v. County of New Hanover, 41 N.C. App. 661, 666, 255 S.E.2d 580, 584, disc. review denied, 298 N.C. 295, 259 S.E.2d 911 (1979) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he law imposes upon every person who enters upon an active course of conduct the positive duty to exercise ordinary care to protect others from harm and calls a violation of that duty negligence\u201d). The undertaking theory has been described as follows:\nAkin to the special relationship exceptions is the \u201cundertaking\u201d theory implicated when a defendant voluntarily \u201cundertakes\u201d to provide needed services to the plaintiff when otherwise she would have no obligation. The agreement may arise from a binding contract between the parties or from a gratuitous promise, unenforceable in contract.\nLogan \u00a7 2.20, at 27. Furthermore, the voluntary undertaking doctrine has been applied in other jurisdictions under similar circumstances. See Furek v. University of Delaware, 594 A.2d 506 (Del. 1991) (holding that, pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 323, a university may be liable for a student\u2019s injuries during fraternity hazing activities when the university knows of the dangers involved in such activities and undertakes to regulate the activities).\nDavidson, 142 N.C. App. at 558-59, 543 S.E.2d at 929.\nPlaintiff argues that\nDefendants knew of the specific dangers involved with open fraternity parties, and they undertook to regulate said activities. Defendants voluntarily undertook to provide services to, and to impose supervision, regulation, enforcement, and control over, [the Chapter] and students participating in Greek organizations or at \u201cGreek\u201d events for the protection of students such as [Plaintiff].\nHowever, in Hall v. Toreros, II, Inc., 176 N.C. App. 309, 316-17, 626 S.E.2d 861, 867 (2006), this Court rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument that the adoption of regulations for the purpose of protecting a class of people constitutes a voluntary undertaking that creates a duty to that class of people that would not otherwise exist. In a case involving a defendant restaurant, this Court stated that it did not want to\ndiscourage, indeed penalize, voluntary assumption or self-imposition of safety standards by commercial enterprises, thereby increasing the risk of danger to their customers and the public. Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that adoption of the [safety standards] by [the defendant] as company policy, standing \u201calone],] [wa]s sufficient for [a] finding of the legal duties submitted to the jury[.]\u201d\nHall, 176 N.C. App. at 317, 626 S.E.2d at 867. Plaintiff relies on Davidson to support his position. We do not find Davidson controlling in the present case. In Davidson, the plaintiff was a junior varsity cheerleader at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Davidson, 142 N.C. App. at 546, 543 S.E.2d at 921. Prior to an UNC women\u2019s basketball game, the junior varsity cheerleaders were warming up and practicing stunts in Carmichael Auditorium, a sports venue owned by UNC and located on the UNC campus, where the women\u2019s basketball game was to occur. Id. at 546, 543 S.E.2d at 922. While practicing a three-tier pyramid stunt, which UNC knew to be dangerous, the plaintiff cheerleader fell and sustained serious bodily injuries and permanent brain damage. Id. According to evidence presented at trial, though the plaintiff cheerleader and the other cheerleaders were representing UNC at official UNC functions, \u201cUNC had not adopted guidelines regarding the experience required to join either cheerleading squad, the skill level required to perform particular stunts, or safety in general.\u201d Id. at 548, 543 S.E.2d at 923. \u201cUNC \u2018never shared with [the cheerleaders] information regarding safety and technical cheerleading skills.\u2019 \u201d Id. Although the UNC varsity cheerleaders attended summer camps \u201cwhere they were exposed to [national] guidelines for cheerleading and safety[,]\u201d the junior varsity cheerleaders were not sent to those camps, and the national guidelines had not been adopted by UNC. Id.\nIn Davidson, the issue presented was \u201cwhether a university ha[d] an affirmative duty of care toward a student athlete who [wa]s a member of a school-sponsored, intercollegiate team.\u201d Davidson, 142 N.C. App. at 553, 543 S.E.2d at 926. In Davidson, this Court made it clear that this was \u201can issue of first impression in North Carolina.\u201d Id.\nUNC \u201cacknowledged that it assumed certain responsibilities with regard to teaching the cheerleaders about safety.\u201d Id. at 559, 543 S.E.2d at 929. Evidence also showed that UNC employees were aware of the particular danger in the type of stunt in which the plaintiff cheerleader was injured. Id. at 548, 543 S.E.2d at 923. The Department of Student Life was responsible for cheerleading squads in the years just prior to the accident. Id. Frederic Schroeder (Schroeder), Director of Student Life, sent letters to the coach of the varsity cheer-leading squad warning about the dangers of the three-tier pyramid, and also sent letters to the co-captains of the varsity squad urging them to adopt certain safety guidelines. Id. Schroeder received a letter from the Assistant Athletic Director at UNC asking him to \u201c \u2018take charge of any future decisions with regard to the safety and well-being\u2019 of the cheerleading squads.\u201d Id. at 549, 543 S.E.2d at 924. These letters were sent several years prior to the accident. Id. This Court held that \u201cthe evidence is uncontroverted that [UNC] voluntarily undertook to advise and educate cheerleaders in regard to safety. Therefore, we hold that [UNC] owed plaintiff a duty of care[.]\u201d Id. at 559, 543 S.E.2d at 930.\nIn the present case, we do not find that Defendants\u2019 actions are analogous to the actions of UNC and its employees in Davidson. We want to encourage universities and Greek organizations to adopt policies to curb underage drinking and drinking-related injuries or other incidents. Adopting such policies, however, does not make a university or Greek organization an insurer of every student, member, or guest who might participate in off-campus activities. Davidson, 142 N.C. App. at 556, 543 S.E.2d at 928. We hold that Defendants assumed no duty to protect Plaintiff from drinking-related injuries at an off-campus party.\nPlaintiff also argues that a duty existed because there was a special relationship between Defendants and Plaintiff. Plaintiff again primarily relies on Davidson. In Davidson, this Court cited a treatise on the law of torts in support of the proposition that a duty may exist for a defendant in certain special relationships, where\n\u201cplaintiff is typically in some respect particularly vulnerable and dependant upon the defendant who, correspondingly, holds considerable power over the plaintiff\u2019s welfare. In addition, such relations have often involved some existing or potential economic advantage to the defendant. Fairness in such cases thus may require the defendant to use his power to help the plaintiff, based upon the plaintiff\u2019s expectation of protection, which itself may be based upon the defendant\u2019s expectation of financial gain.\u201d\nDavidson, 142 N.C. App. at 554, 543 S.E.2d at 926-27 (citation omitted). In Davidson, this relationship is clear. The plaintiff was a cheerleader, representing UNC at school events. The plaintiff and the other cheerleaders helped to promote UNC to potential students and donors. Id. at 555, 543 S.E.2d at 927.\nIn the present case, Plaintiff was attending an off-campus party, uninvited, and Plaintiff was not acting in any manner as a representative of Elon. Plaintiff had no relationship whatsoever with Lambda Chi, the Chapter, Cassady, or Blackburn. This Court was careful to limit its holding in Davidson to the facts of that case:\nWe emphasize that our holding is based on the fact that plaintiff was injured while practicing as part of a school-sponsored, intercollegiate team. Our holding should not be interpreted as finding a special relationship to exist between a university, college, or other secondary educational institution, and every stu dent attending the school, or even every member of a student group, club, intramural team, or organization. We agree with the conclusion reached by other jurisdictions addressing this issue that a university should not generally be an insurer of its students\u2019 safety, and that, therefore, the student-university relationship, standing alone, does not constitute a special relationship giving rise to a duty of care.\nDavidson, 142 N.C. App. at 556, 543 S.E.2d at 928 (citations omitted). We hold that no special relationship resulting in the imposition of a duty existed between Defendants and Plaintiff when Plaintiff voluntarily, and uninvited, attended an off-campus party of which Elon had no knowledge. Suffice it to say that no special relationship existed on these facts between Lambda Chi and Plaintiff, either.\nWe have also examined Plaintiff\u2019s argument that he alleged sufficient affirmative acts by Defendants to survive summary judgment based upon ordinary principles of negligence. We find it unnecessary to include any analysis for this argument and hold that it fails as a matter of law. We hold that Defendants owed no duty to Plaintiff on these facts and, therefore, Plaintiff\u2019s claims for negligence fail as a matter of law.\nIV. Agency\nPlaintiff next argues that Defendants are liable to him based upon agency relationships. We disagree.\nPlaintiff cites to some general law regarding the principle of agency, followed by an unsupported statement that, in this case, Elon and Lambda Chi were principals to the Chapter, and thus liable by respondeat superior for the torts of the Chapter member Cassady. However, Plaintiff provides no specific support for his argument that the law of agency applied in this particular fact situation. After thorough research, we conclude this is because no such authority exists. We decline to make new law by recognizing an agency relationship between Plaintiff and any Defendants on the facts of this case. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is without merit.\nV. Joint Venture\nPlaintiff\u2019s argument with regard to joint venture likewise fails. Plaintiff again does not support his argument with any law applicable to the facts before us, and we find no law to support Plaintiff\u2019s position. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is without merit.\nVI. Conclusion\nDefendants owed no duty to Plaintiff that would support Plaintiffs claims for negligence. Plaintiffs claims based upon agency and joint venture likewise fail as a matter of law. We affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants.\nAffirmed.\nJudges CALABRIA and GEER concur.", "author": "McGEE, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["JOHN LEE MYNHARDT, Plaintiff-Appellant v.

Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019) agreed to finance the purchase of the home and provided a loan to Mrs. Smith in the amount of $117,900.00. The general warranty deed named the grantees as \u201cMargaret D. Smith and Troy D. Reed and wife, Judy C. Reed Joint Tenants with rights of survivorship[.]\u201d The deed of trust to secure Plaintiff\u2019s loan and promissory note was prepared in Mrs. Smith\u2019s name only and was executed by Mrs. Reed, as attorney in fact for Mrs. Smith, on 1 May 2001. Neither Mr. Reed nor Mrs. Reed signed the deed of trust or promissory note in his or her individual capacity.\nDefendants lived together in the home with Mrs. Smith and cared for Mrs. Smith, such that Mrs. Smith was not required to go to a nursing home.\nOn 19 October 2001, the loan went into default and foreclosure proceedings were commenced.\nOn 7 February 2004, Mrs. Smith passed away. After Mrs. Smith\u2019s death, Defendants began corresponding with Plaintiff regarding a modification of the loan, such that the loan would be in Defendants\u2019 name. Plaintiff drafted a loan modification agreement on 25 June 2004 and sent the agreement to Defendants. The agreement purportedly \u201camend[ed] and supplemented] (1) the Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Deed to Secure Debt (the \u2018Security Instrument\u2019).\u201d Defendants signed the agreement on 6 July 2004.\nDefendants made payments on the loan to Plaintiff for a short period of time, until approximately August or September 2004. Defendants did not make any additional payments after 2004, and Plaintiff made demand for the payments. On 16 November 2004, Plaintiff notified Defendants that the loan was in default for nonpayment, and Plaintiff gave Defendants the opportunity to cure the default by paying or seeking a loan modification.\nIn 2006, Defendants requested that they be considered for a further loan modification. However, this modification was denied because Mr. Reed failed to provide proof of income as required.\nOn 22 January 2009, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants praying that the court order reformation of the deed of trust to reflect the intent of the parties by making Defendants obligors.\nOn 16 April 2009, Defendants filed an answer and counterclaims alleging negligent misrepresentation and a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53-243.il. Defendants claimed they were entitled to injunctive relief.\nOn 24 January 2011, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, stating that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that Plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both Plaintiff\u2019s claim and Defendants\u2019 counterclaims.\nLikewise, on 17 February 2011, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment alleging there was no genuine issue of material fact and that they were entitled to judgment in their favor as a matter of law for the following reasons: (1) The reformation of instruments is governed by a three year statute of limitations, and because the date of closing on the loan in this case was 1 May 2001, the statute of limitations was tolled before Plaintiff sought reformation of the Deed of Trust; and (2) Defendants were not a party to the contract in this case, as neither Defendant signed the Note.\nThe trial court entered an order on 25 March 2011, decreeing that there was no genuine issue of fact in this case and granting summary judgment in Plaintiff\u2019s favor. The trial court also \u201cdeclar[ed] judgment ... as follows\u201d:\n1. Margaret D. Smith, prior to her death, owned a one-half undivided interest in the real property more particularly described at Deed Book 1259, page 1119-1120, Iredell County Registry. Margaret D. Smith\u2019s one-half undivided interest is encumbered by a deed of trust to the benefit of Plaintiff which is recorded at Book 1259, pages 1122-1134 of the ICR.\n2. Troy D. Reed and Judy C. Reed, as Tenants by Entireties, own a one-half undivided interest in the subject real property which is not encumbered by the deed of trust to the benefit of Plaintiff.\n3. Upon the death of Margaret Smith her interest, subject to the deed of trust to the benefit of Plaintiff, vested in Troy D. Reed and wife Judy C. Reed pursuant to the Right of Survivorship as set forth in the deed.\n4. The Loan Modification Agreement executed by Troy D. Reed and Judy C. Reed on July 6, 2004 does not create an encumbrance on the Reed\u2019s original one-half undivided interest in the real property.\n5. Troy D. Reed and wife Judy Reed own the real property in fee simple absolute; subject to Plaintiff\u2019s deed of trust encumbering a one-half undivided interest in said real property.\nFrom this order, Defendants appeal.\nI: Plaintiff\u2019s Appeal\nWe first address Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal for Plaintiff\u2019s failure to file an appellant\u2019s brief. An appellant\u2019s brief is due thirty days after the Clerk of the Court of Appeals mails the printed record to the parties. N.C. R. App. P. 13(a) (2012). N.C. R. App. P. 14(d)(2) (2012) provides that \u201c[i]f an appellant fails to file and serve its brief within the time allowed, the appeal may be dismissed on motion of an appellee or on the court\u2019s own initiative[.]\u201d Id. In this case, the briefs were to be filed no later than 10 August 2011. Plaintiff failed to file a cross-appellant\u2019s brief.\nWe find the case of Alberti v. Manufactured Homes, Inc., 329 N.C. 727, 407 S.E.2d 819 (1991) to be instructive. In Alberti, the Court ruled:\nPlaintiffs gave proper notice of appeal on these issues [of attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages, and interest] but did not file an appellant\u2019s brief within the time allowed under Rule 13 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rather, they attempted to argue the issues in their appellee\u2019s brief. The Court of Appeals, therefore, correctly held that plaintiffs had failed to preserve any of these questions for its review, and we affirm this decision.\nBecause on these issues plaintiffs are seeking affirmative relief in the appellate division rather than simply arguing an alternative basis in law for supporting the judgment, they are not enti tied to cross-assign error in their appellee\u2019s brief. N.C. R. App. P. 10(d). To have properly raised these issues plaintiffs should have filed, but did not file, an appellant\u2019s brief.\nId. at 739, 407 S.E.2d at 826.\nBecause Plaintiff did not file a cross-appellant\u2019s brief in this case, we grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal and will not address the question of whether the trial court erred by concluding that \u201c[t]he Loan Modification Agreement executed by Troy D. Reed and Judy C. Reed on July 6, 2004 does not create an encumbrance on the Reed\u2019s original one-half undivided interest in the real property.\u201d\nII: Defendants\u2019 Appeal\nA: Standard of Review\nWe review a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying summary judgment de novo. Builders Mut. Ins. Co. v. N. Main Constr., Ltd., 361 N.C. 85, 88, 637 S.E.2d 528, 530 (2006) (citation omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2011). \u201cAll facts asserted by the adverse party are taken as true, and their inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to that party.\u201d Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, 835 (2000) (citations omitted). \u201cThe showing required for summary judgment may be accomplished by proving an essential element of the opposing party\u2019s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense[.]\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\nSummary judgment may be granted in a declaratory judgment proceeding, \u201cand the scope of appellate review from allowance of a summary judgment motion therein is the same as for other actions.\u201d N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Briley, 127 N.C. App. 442, 444, 491 S.E.2d 656, 657 (1997), disc. rev. denied, 347 N.C. 577, 500 S.E.2d 82 (1998).\nB: Summary Judgment\nIn Defendants\u2019 argument on appeal, they contend the trial court erred by granting, in part, Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because the deed of trust did not survive Mrs. Smith\u2019s death. We find this argument without merit.\nThe question presented in this appeal is a novel one. The general warranty deed filed on 2 May 2001 created a joint tenancy between Mrs. Smith and Defendants, with right of survivorship. However, the deed of trust, which was filed one minute after the general warranty deed, encumbered the property. Mrs. Smith was the sole obligor on the deed of trust. This Court must determine whether the deed of trust severed the joint tenancy, such that only the portion of the property owned by Mrs. Smith was encumbered, or whether the deed of trust did not sever the joint tenancy, but instead obligated Mrs. Smith and Defendants, thus encumbering the entire property.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 41-2(a) (2011) permits the creation of a joint tenancy with right of survivorship \u201cif the instrument creating the joint tenancy expressly provides for a right of survivorship.\u201d Id. \u201cUpon conveyance to a third party by one of two joint tenants holding property in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, a tenancy in common is created between the third party and the remaining joint tenant.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\u201cA mortgage is a conveyance by a debtor to his creditor, or to some one in trust for him, as a security for the debt.\u201d Walston v. Twiford, 248 N.C. 691, 693, 105 S.E.2d 62, 64 (1958) (quotation omitted).\nNorth Carolina is considered a title theory state with respect to mortgages, where a mortgagee does not receive a mere lien on mortgaged real property, but receives legal title to the land for security purposes. In North Carolina, deeds of trust are used in most mortgage transactions, whereby a borrower conveys land to a third-party trustee to hold for the mortgagee-lender, subject to the condition that the conveyance shall be void on payment of debt at maturity. Thus, in North Carolina, the trustee holds legal title to the land.\nNeil Realty Co. v. Medical Care, Inc., 110 N.C. App. 776, 778, 431 S.E.2d 225, 226-27 (1993) (citations omitted).\nThe doctrine of survivorship does not apply to tenancies in common, and upon the death of a person holding property as a tenant in common, the person\u2019s share descends to her heirs or is devised as her will provides. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 41-2; see also See 1 James A. Webster, Jr., Patrick K. Hetrick & James B. McLaughlin, Jr., Webster\u2019s Real Estate Law in North Carolina \u00a7 7.05 (6th ed. 2011). \u201cAny joint ten ancy interest held by a husband and wife, unless otherwise specified, shall be deemed to be held as a single tenancy by the entirety, which shall be treated as a single party when determining interests in the joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 41-2(b).\nIn this case, because North Carolina is a title theory State, and thus a mortgage is a conveyance, Mrs. Smith severed the joint tenancy when she, as the sole obligor on the deed of trust, filed the deed of trust encumbering the property. After the joint tenancy was severed, Mrs. Smith\u2019s interest as a tenant in common was one-half of the property; Defendants\u2019 interest, as tenants by the entirety, was also one-half. This is because Defendants are husband and wife; as such, they held the property \u201cas a single tenancy by the entirety\u201d and were \u201ctreated as a single party when determining interests in the joint tenancy with right of survivorship\u201d upon severance of the joint tenancy. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 41-2(b).\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the trial court was correct in concluding that \u201cTroy D. Reed and Judy C. Reed, as Tenants by Entireties, own a one-half undivided interest in the subject real property which is not encumbered by the deed of trust to the benefit of Plaintifff.]\u201d In other words, the deed of trust executed by Mrs. Smith only encumbered Mrs. Smith\u2019s interest in the property \u2014 the portion of the property owned by Mrs. Smith as a tenant in common after the severance of the joint tenancy by the filing of the deed of trust. However, we further hold the trial court was incorrect in concluding that \u201c[u]pon the death of Margaret Smith her interest, subject to the deed of trust to the benefit of Plaintiff, vested in Troy D. Reed and wife Judy C. Reed pursuant to the Right of Survivorship as set forth in the deed.\u201d The joint tenancy was severed upon the filing of the deed of trust, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 41-2, and Mrs. Smith\u2019s interest in the property converted to a tenancy in common, which has no right of survivorship. Lastly, because Mrs. Smith\u2019s interest in the property did not vest pursuant to the right of survivorship, we hold the trial court was also incorrect in concluding that \u201cTroy D. Reed and wife Judy Reed own the real property in fee simple absolute[.]\u201d\nIn summary, we hold that the trial court was correct in concluding that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact in this case and that Plaintiff is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether the deed of trust in this case encumbered Mrs. Smith\u2019s one-half interest in the property as a tenant in common. We further conclude that the trial court erred by concluding that Mrs. Smith\u2019s interest in the property \u201cvested in Troy D. Reed and wife Judy C. Reed pursuant to the Right of Survivorship\u201d and Defendants \u201cown the real property in fee simple absolute[,] subject to Plaintiff\u2019s deed of trust.\u201d The joint tenancy was severed upon the filing of the deed of trust, and Mrs. Smith\u2019s interest in the property converted to a tenancy in common, which has no right of survivorship.\nAFFIRMED, in part, REVERSED, in part, and DISMISSED, in part.\nJudges ERVIN and BEASLEY concur.\n. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53-243.11, the Mortgage Lending Act, was repealed after the filing of Plaintiffs counterclaim in this case by 2009 N.C. Sess. Laws 374 \u00a7 1, effective 31 July 2009. The Secure and Fair Enforcement Mortgage Licensing Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53-244.010, et seq., was codified.\n. Other States have codified statutes addressing the particular question raised in this appeal, and our General Assembly may also consider and address this issue, should it be so inclined. South Carolina, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-7-40(a)(iii) (2011) prohibits any encumbrance of a joint tenancy unless all joint tenants join in the encumbrance. See S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-7-40(a)(iii) (providing, \u201c[t]he fee interest in real estate held in joint tenancy may not be encumbered by a joint tenant acting alone without the joinder of the other joint tenant or tenants in the encumbrance\u201d). In Wisconsin, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 700.24 (2011) provides that on the death of a mortgaging joint tenant the survivor takes subject to the mortgage. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 700.24 (stating that a real estate mortgage, a security interest, or a lien \u201con or against the interest of a joint tenant does not defeat the right of survivorship in the event of the death of such joint tenant, but the surviving joint tenant or tenants take the interest such deceased joint tenant could have transferred prior to death subject to such mortgage, security interest or statutory lien\u201d).", "author": "THIGPEN, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS, INC., Plaintiff v.

(defendant). We reverse.\nOn 17 June 2008, Massie was admitted to the psychiatric unit of Halifax Regional Medical Center for a recurring nervous condition. Massie had difficulty walking and standing, and at the time of her admission, her husband, Denny, sought to bring Massie\u2019s walker or cane into the hospital. Denny was told not to include these items, because the hospital would provide Massie with everything she needed. The psychiatrist who admitted Massie then informed the nurses that she had trouble standing.\nOn the evening of 17 June 2008, Massie was preparing to walk to the cafeteria for her evening meal. She exited her room and stood against the wall near the nurses\u2019 station. While standing there she said aloud that she was going to fall. None of the nurses offered Massie a wheel chair, cane, or walker. She then fell to the floor and sustained injuries.\nOn 16 June 2010 plaintiffs filed suit against defendant for Massie\u2019s injuries, alleging gross negligence. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with N.C.R. Civ. R, Rule 9(j). In that motion, defendant argued that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged medical malpractice, but that plaintiffs \u201cfailed to certify that they have had a health care provider who reviewed the medical records of this action prior to filing suit and who will testify that the medical care did not comply with the applicable standards of care.\u201d The trial court agreed, and entered an order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 suit without prejudice and assessing defendant\u2019s costs against plaintiffs. In that order the trial court stated that plaintiffs \u201cpled a medical malpractice action\u201d and that plaintiffs \u201chave had an opportunity to have the case reviewed by a healthcare provider . . . but have not yet done so[.]\u201d Plaintiffs now appeal.\nPlaintiffs first argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their complaint for failure to include a Rule 9(j) certification. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in concluding that their complaint alleged medical malpractice. We agree.\n\u201cThis Court must conduct a de novo review of the pleadings to determine their legal sufficiency and to determine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to dismiss was correct.\u201d Leary v. N.C. Forest Prods., Inc., 157 N.C. App. 396, 400, 580 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2003), aff\u2019d per curiam, 357 N.C. 567, 597 S.E.2d 673-74 (2003). \u201cRule 9(j) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that complaints alleging medical malpractice by a health care provider . . . shall be dismissed unless the complaint specifically asserts that the medical care has been reviewed by a person who will qualify as an expert witness or by a person the complainant will seek to have qualified as an expert witness.\u201d Lewis v. Setty, 130 N.C. App. 606, 607-08, 503 S.E.2d 673, 674 (1998) (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cA medical malpractice action ... is defined as a civil action for damages for personal injury or death arising out of the furnishing or failure to furnish professional services ... by a health care provider. Professional services has been defined by this Court to mean an act or service . . . involving specialized knowledge, labor, or skill[.]\u201d Id. at 608, 503 S.E.2d at 674 (quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis added). A hospital is considered a health care provider. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 90-21.11 (2011).\nHere, plaintiffs\u2019 primary argument on appeal is that the nurses\u2019 decision, whether to provide Massie with a cane, involved a matter of ordinary care and did not require the exercise of clinical judgment and intellectual skill. Defendant argues the opposite and relies on this Court\u2019s ruling in Sturgill v. Ashe Mem\u2019l Hosp., Inc., as the basis for its argument.\nIn Sturgill, the plaintiff brought a claim against the hospital for the death of her father. There, the nurses failed to apply restraints to the plaintiff\u2019s father and he fell out of his hospital bed and died. The plaintiff alleged that \u201c[i]f he had been properly restrained, [my father] would not have been able to have gotten out of bed and fallen.\u201d 186 N.C. App. 624, 630, 652 S.E.2d 302, 306 (2007) (emphasis in original). This Court concluded that \u201cthe decision to apply restraints is a medical decision requiring clinical judgment and intellectual skill\u201d and that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s complaint is a claim for medical malpractice, thus requiring [R]ule 9(j) certification.\u201d Id. However, in reaching this conclusion we found that \u201c[i]t is undisputed in the record that the use of restraints is a medical decision that normally requires an order written by a physician or physician\u2019s assistant. It is also undisputed in the record that [a] medical assessment for the use of restraints can be delicate and complex, and as such, requires the application of clinical judgment.\u201d Id.\nWe find the facts of the case subjudice to be distinguishable from Sturgill. Here, nothing in the record indicates that the decision to offer a cane to a patient requires a written order or a medical assessment. Rather, that decision more closely mirrors the cases in which we have held that the actions of the healthcare provider did not require specialized skills.\nIn Norris v. Rowan Memorial Hospital, Inc., the plaintiff sued the hospital for failure of its nurses to raise her bed side rails, causing her to fall out of her bed and be injured. We held that the nurses\u2019 actions \u201cdid not involve the rendering or failure to render professional nursing or medical services requiring special skills, [and that] expert testimony on behalf of the plaintiff as to the standard of due care prevailing among hospitals in like situations is not necessary to develop a case of negligence for the jury.\u201d 21 N.C. App. 623, 626, 205 S.E.2d 345, 348 (1974).\nLikewise, in Lewis the plaintiff sued a physician for failure to lower the examination table prior to transferring him from his wheelchair to the table. We held that \u201cthe removal of the plaintiff from the examination table to the wheelchair did not involve an occupation involving specialized knowledge or skill, as it was predominately a physical or manual activity. It thus follows that the alleged negligent acts of the defendant do not fall into the realm of professional medical services.\u201d 130 N.C. App. at 608, 503 S.E.2d at 674. We then held that \u201c[i]t was not necessary, therefore, for the plaintiff to specifically comply with Rule 9(j) and the dismissal must be reversed.\u201d Id. at 609, 503 S.E.2d at 674.\nHere, we conclude that the decision of whether to offer a cane to a patient who has trouble walking is not one that requires specialized skill. As a result, expert testimony on the matter is not necessary to develop a case of negligence for the jury. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial court dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and assessing defendant\u2019s costs against plaintiffs.\nReversed.\nJudges GEER and THIGPEN concur.", "author": "ELMORE, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["Massie Horsley and Denny Horsley, Plaintiffs v.

For the following reasons, we reverse in part the orders of the trial court.\nI. Facts and background\nThe Mitchell County Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) filed juvenile petitions on 12 August 2009 alleging the minor children George and Sam to be neglected in that they did not receive proper care, supervision, or discipline, and they lived in an environment injurious to their welfare, and dependent in that they were in need of placement. At the time the petitions were filed, respondent-father was incarcerated; the children were living with their mother. DSS was granted non-secure custody of the children, and the children were placed in foster care.\nThe children were adjudicated neglected based solely upon the mother\u2019s acts or omissions, by orders entered 20 November 2009; the order specifically noted that \u201cthere was no evidence as to any neglectful conduct relative to the respondent father\u201d and he \u201chad no part to play in any of the conduct leading to the filing of the Petition herein.\u201d By disposition orders entered on the same day, the trial court authorized continued custody with DSS and ordered the children\u2019s mother to complete a substance abuse treatment program as well as satisfy all requirements set forth in her case plan with DSS. The disposition orders made no mention of respondent-father. At a permanency planning review hearing held on 3 May 2010, the trial court relieved DSS of all responsibility for reunification efforts \u201cwith either respondent parent\u201d and authorized a permanent plan of adoption.\nOn 7 July 2010, DSS filed motions to terminate both parents\u2019 rights to the minor children, and alleged the ground of neglect pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(l). On 26 October 2010, respondent-father filed a response denying the material allegations of the DSS motions and seeking to have the motions dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to allege sufficient facts upon which relief may be granted.\nBy the time the termination hearing was held on 12 July 2011, respondent-father had been released early from prison and was employed. DSS presented evidence that in 2006 the children had been adjudicated neglected in Avery County as a result of respondent-father\u2019s actions and, after all of DSS\u2019s evidence had been presented, DSS moved under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(b) to amend the motions to terminate to conform with the evidence by including the additional allegation that respondent-father \u201cwas the parent involved in the petitions in Avery County where an adjudication of neglect was made based upon his conduct.\u201d Over objection, the trial court allowed the motion to amend the termination motions. The trial court denied motions to dismiss made by respondent-father. The trial court made no ruling during the hearing but by written orders entered 15 August 2011, held that respondent-father neglected the minor children and that termination of respondent-father\u2019s parental rights was in the best interests of the minor children and thus ordered that his rights be terminated. Respondent-father appeals, arguing that (1) the trial court erred in allowing DSS to amend the motions to terminate his parental rights to conform to the evidence at the termination hearing; (2) the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights without making sufficient findings of fact to support a conclusion of neglect; and (3) the order of termination improperly lists conclusions of law as findings of fact and fails to state a statutory basis for termination.\nII. Amendment to motions to terminate parental rights\nRespondent-father first contends the trial court erred in allowing DSS to amend the motions to terminate his parental rights to conform to the evidence presented at the termination hearing. \u201cA motion to amend is addressed to the discretion of the court, and its decision thereon is not subject to review except in case of manifest abuse.\u201d Calloway v. Ford Motor Co., 281 N.C. 496, 501, 189 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1972) (citations omitted). But in this situation, respondent-father contends that the amendment to conform to the pleadings under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(b) is not allowed as a matter of law pursuant to In re B.L.H., 190 N.C. App. 142, 660 S.E.2d 255, aff'd per curiam, 362 N.C. 674, 669 S.E.2d 320 (2008). For questions of law, we apply de novo review. In re D.S., 364 N.C. 184, 187, 694 S.E.2d 758, 760 (2010). Specifically, respondent-father, citing In re B.L.H., argues that the trial court erred in allowing the amendment because he was not properly put on notice that the adjudication of neglect from Avery County in 2006 would be added to the claims raised by the petition and used against him in the termination proceedings, as \u201c[t]here were no facts concerning this prior case alleged in the petitionf.]\u201d. Respondent-father concludes that because of the lack of notice he was \u201cunable to effectively prepare a defense against those allegations\u201d and the orders terminating his parental rights should be reversed.\nIn In re B.L.H., 190 N.C. App. 142, 660 S.E.2d 255, we addressed the issue of an amendment to a petition to terminate the parental rights of the respondent-mother. In that case, on 30 January 2007 and 5 February 2007 DSS filed petitions to terminate the parental rights of the respondent-mother, alleging that (1) the minor children were neglected and there was a high risk of repetition of neglect, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(l) and that (2) the minor children had been in DSS custody for more than six continuous months and the respondent-mother had willfully failed to pay a portion of their care, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(3). Id. at 144, 660 S.E.2d at 256. At the hearing on these petitions, a social worker testified regarding the custody and placement of the minor children from 2005 to 2006 and DSS moved to amend the termination petitions to conform to the evidence to include an additional ground not raised in the original petition, specifically under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(2), that the minor children had been left in foster care for a period of 12 months preceding the filing of the petition. Id. Over the respondent-mother\u2019s objection that \u201cshe received no notice of the allegation and that such an amendment was a substantial change to the petitions requiring additional time to prepare a defense[,]\u201d the trial court allowed the amendment and subsequently entered orders terminating the respondent-mother\u2019s parental rights based only on the amended allegations pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(2). Id. The respondent-mother appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in amending the petitions; DSS countered that the amendment was allowed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(b). Id. This Court, after noting that \u201c[t]he Rules of Civil Procedure will. . . apply to fill procedural gaps where Chapter 7B requires, but does not identify, a specific procedure to be used in termination, cases\u201d stated that Chapter 7B, Article 11 of our General Statutes, which addresses the termination of parental rights, \u201cis entirely silent on the amendment of petitions or motions in termination proceedings])]\u201d Id. at 146, 660 S.E.2d at 257. This Court further stated that\n[t]he only right of amendment permitted in Chapter 7B proceedings is for the amendment of a petition in juvenile, abuse, neglect or dependency proceedings, and this right is limited to \u201cwhen the amendment does not change the nature of the conditions upon which the petition is based.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-800 (2007).\nId. This Court went on to hold that\n[accordingly, we will not superimpose a right to amend a petition or motion for termination of parental rights to conform with the evidence presented at the adjudication hearing and the trial court erred by allowing the amendment. See Peirce, 53 N.C. App. at 380, 281 S.E.2d at 203(holding \u201cthe legislative intent was that G.S., Chap. 7A, Art. 24B, [now Article 11 of Chapter 7B] exclusively control the procedure to be followed in the termination of parental rights.\u201d).\nId. at 146-47, 660 S.E.2d at 257. Thus, B.L.H. seems to establish that Chapter 7B, Article 11 entirely eliminates the use of a motion to amend a petition or motion for termination of parental rights to conform to the evidence presented at the hearing under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(b).\nThe B.L.H. Court then addressed whether there was sufficient notice to the respondent-mother in the original petition, and noted that\n[a] petition for termination of parental rights must allege \u201c[f]acts that are sufficient to warrant a determination that one or more of the grounds for terminating parental rights [listed in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111] exist.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1104(6) (2007). \u201cWhile there is no requirement that the factual allegations [in a petition for termination of parental rights] be exhaustive or extensive, they must put a party on notice as to what acts, omissions, or conditions are at issue.\u201d In re Hardesty, 150 N.C. App. 380, 384, 563 S.E.2d 79, 82 (2002). Where the factual allegations in a petition to terminate parental rights do not refer to a specific statutory ground for termination, the trial court may find any ground for termination under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111 as long as the factual allegations in the petition give the respondent sufficient notice of the ground. In re A.H., 183 N.C. App. 609, 644 S.E.2d 635 (2007); In re Humphrey, 156 N.C. App. 533, 577 S.E.2d 421 (2003). However, where a respondent lacks notice of a possible ground for termination, it is error for the trial court to conclude such a ground exists. In re C.W. & J.W., 182 N.C. App. 214, 228-29, 641 S.E.2d 725, 735 (2007); Hardesty, 150 N.C. App. at 384, 563 S.E.2d at 82.\nId. at 147, 660 S.E.2d at 257-58. In reversing the trial court\u2019s orders, this Court further held that the petitions as originally filed by DSS, without the amendments, were not sufficient to give the respondent-mother notice that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(2) was a possible ground for terminating her parental rights and that the trial court erred in finding grounds existed to terminate respondent-mother\u2019s parental rights to the minor children pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(2). Id. at 148, 660 S.E.2d at 258.\nThus, based on this Court\u2019s ruling in B.L.H. that there is no right to amend a termination petition to conform to the evidence at hearing under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15(b), see id. at 146-47, 660 S.E.2d at 257, we must hold that as a matter of law that the trial court erred in allowing DSS to amend the petitions to terminate the parental rights of respondent-father. But this does not end our analysis, as we still must determine if the original motions to terminate respondent-father\u2019s parental rights gave sufficient notice that DSS was seeking termination based on neglect, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(l).\nThe motions to terminate parental rights as filed by DSS on 7 July 2010 alleged the following regarding respondent-father:\n4. Mitchell County Department of Social Services was awarded custody of the above-named juvenile pursuant to the aforementioned Orders. That the facts sufficient to warrant the termination of parental rights of the above-named respondent parents are as follows:\na. That the respondent mother has neglected the juvenile and has continued to neglect the juvenile as defined by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-101(a)(l) and there is a likelihood of future neglect if the juvenile is returned to the parents, to wit:\n(7) At all relevant times herein, respondent father has been incarcerated with the North Carolina Department of Corrections and has not been available as a resource to provide for the juvenile. Respondent father is serving a sentence for being a habitual felon. He currently has approximately 3 years remaining with that sentence.\n(Emphasis added.) First we note that even though the mother is specifically referenced in the allegations of neglect, the motions also allege the respondent-father\u2019s incarceration and lack of availability to care for the children. The motions also allege that DSS is seeking termination of the \u201cparents [\u2019]\u201d parental rights and there was \u201ca likelihood of future neglect if the juvenile is returned to the parentsf.]\u2019\u2019(emphasis added). Certainly, the respondent-father\u2019s incarceration could be a factor in determining whether to terminate respondent-father\u2019s parental rights based on neglect. See In re C.W., 182 N.C. App. 214, 220, 641 S.E.2d 725, 730 (2007) (noting in a termination of parental rights case, \u201c[a] parent\u2019s incarceration may be relevant to whether his child is neglected; however, [i]ncarceration, standing alone, is neither a sword nor a shield in a termination of parental rights decision.\u201d (citations and quotation marks omitted)). Thus, the motions gave respondent-father notice of the possibility of the termination of his parental rights for neglect under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(l), although the factual circumstances alleged in the original motion were limited to his incarceration, which was expected to continue for three more years.\nEven if we assume arguendo that it would also be necessary for the motion for termination to allege the specific factual circumstances of the 2006 adjudication of neglect based upon respondent-father\u2019s conduct, in this case it would not change the result, as the trial court did not rely upon any factual circumstances related to respondent-father except his incarceration. It appears that the trial court did not base its determination of neglect upon the 2006 adjudication in Avery County as the trial court made no mention of it at the conclusion of the hearing in open court and there is no finding of fact that references this specific allegation. Thus, the fact that the trial court erroneously allowed the amendment to the motions appears to have had no effect upon its ultimate determination of neglect. This case differs from B.L.H., as in B.L.H, there was no notice to. the respondent-mother of the possibility of termination based on N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(2), which was the only ground that the trial court found in terminating her parent rights, because DSS\u2019s original petitions had only alleged grounds supporting termination of parental rights pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(l) and N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(3). See id. Accordingly, DSS\u2019s motion to terminate parental rights gave respondent-father notice that DSS was seeking to terminate his parental rights based on neglect stemming from his incarceration, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-llll(a)(l), but because the trial court did not rely upon the amendment, respondent-father was not prejudiced by the amendment to the motions.\nIII. Neglect\nRespondent-father next contends that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights based on neglect because the findings of fact do not support the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law. We have stated that \u201c[t]he standard for review in termination of parental rights cases is whether the findings of fact are supported by clear, cogent and convincing evidence and whether these findings, in turn, support the conclusions of law.\u201d In re Clark, 72 N.C. App. 118, 124, 323 S.E.2d 754, 758 (1984).\nA child is neglected if he or she\ndoes not receive proper care, supervision, or discipline from the juvenile\u2019s parent, guardian, custodian, or caretaker; or who has been abandoned; or who is not provided necessary medical care; or who is not provided necessary remedial care; or who lives in an environment injurious to the juvenile\u2019s welfare; or who has been placed for care or adoption in violation of law.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-101(15) (2009). In determining neglect, the court must consider \u201cthe fitness of the parent to care for the child at the time of the termination proceeding.\" In re Ballard, 311 N.C. 708, 715, 319 S.E.2d 227, 232 (1984) (emphasis in original). Although evidence of past neglect is admissible, \u201c[t]he trial court must also consider any evidence of changed conditions in light of the evidence of prior neglect and the probability of a repetition of neglect.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). This is especially true where the parent has not had custody of the child for quite some time. Id. at 714, 319 S.E.2d at 231.\nAs to respondent-father, the trial court in its orders found:\n(7) At all relevant times herein, Respondent Father has been incarcerated with the North Carolina Department of Corrections and has not been available as a resource to provide for the Juvenile[s], Respondent Father is serving a sentence for being a habitual felon. At the time of the Hearing in this Matter, Respondent Father had been released early from the sentences imposed herein. Furthermore, Respondent Father has neglected [the] Juvenile[s] and has continued to neglect the Juvenile[s] as defined by N.C. G. S. \u00a7 7B-101(a)(l) and there is a likelihood of future neglect if the Juvenilefs] [are] returned to him.\n8. Respondent[-father] has not been a part of the life of the juvenile [s] since 9 December 2006 when he was first arrested for the charges leading to his latest incarceration. This has resulted in him being in prison for over 4 years of the [juveniles\u2019 lives]. Previously, Respondent[-father] was in prison during the earlier years of the [juveniles\u2019 lives]. Because of the foregoing, the Court finds that there currently exists little or no bond between the juvenile[s] and respondent father[.]\nThe trial court concluded that the minor children were neglected and \u201c[t]here remains a likelihood of future neglect if the [juveniles are] returned to either of the Respondent Parents\u201d and that it was in the best interest of the juveniles that the parental rights of both parents be terminated.\nThe trial court\u2019s findings focus on respondent-father\u2019s past incarceration and mention that he had been released from prison. But there are no specific findings as to current conditions of neglect after respondent-father\u2019s release, any changes in circumstances following his release, or how his current conditions or behavior show a probability of repetition of neglect. See Ballard, 311 N.C. at 715, 319 S.E.2d at 232. In fact, our review of the transcript and evidence indicates that DSS presented no evidence as to the respondent-father\u2019s circumstances since his release from incarceration and no evidence which would indicate a likelihood of repetition of neglect by respondent-father. DSS\u2019s evidence at the hearing focused almost entirely on the mother and on the children\u2019s progress and bond with their foster family. As to respondent-father, DSS\u2019s evidence was that he had been incarcerated as a habitual felon and that he had attempted to stay in contact with the children by writing while in prison, although only the first letters, in October of 2009, were given to the children. DSS stopped delivering written correspondence from respondent-father to the children because someone, either a social worker or therapist, determined that the letters were too upsetting to the children based upon their reaction to the letters, and not based on \u201canything [respondent-father] said\u201d in the letters. Respondent-father\u2019s evidence tended to show that he sent approximately 10 to 20 letters or cards to the children while he was incarcerated. His evidence also tended to show that he had full-time employment since January 2011, as he had begun working on work release prior to his parole in May 2011; he had family medical insurance available through his employer; he had his own furnished apartment which was near both his workplace and schools for the children; he did not drink any alcoholic beverages and was not on any medication, prescribed or not; and he had no relationship with the mother because of the way she had treated the children during his incarceration. Respondent-father also presented evidence that while incarcerated, he completed an anger management course; a character education course; a human resource development program; and a \u201cfather accountability\u201d class which lasted for about 16 weeks, meeting twice a week. He also testified regarding the 2006 adjudication of neglect, which occurred when he was arrested for driving while impaired with the children in the car, and the mother was not immediately available to care for the children; the children were returned to the parents 9 days later.\nThe factual situation presented here is quite similar to that at issue in In re Shermer, 156 N.C. App. 281, 576 S.E.2d 403 (2003) in which this Court reversed the trial court\u2019s termination of the previously-incarcerated father\u2019s parental rights based upon neglect. Actually, respondent-father herein appears to have made more progress than the father in Shermer, who was still attending classes and seeking employment at the time of the termination hearing. Id. at 283, 576 S.E.2d at 405. In Shermer, this Court stated that\n[h]ere, we see no clear, cogent, and convincing evidence and no finding that respondent has neglected his children or that any past neglect was likely to reoccur. The trial court took judicial notice of past orders in which it had found that both children were neglected. However, as respondent points out in his brief, conditions have changed since then. When the previous orders were entered, the children lived with Sherry Shermer, respondent\u2019s ex-wife, and respondent was in prison. The orders concerned one incident where Ms. Shermer allegedly fired a gun around the children and another where Ms. Shermer brought Buddy along on an attempt to help respondent escape from prison. Although these orders are rel evant evidence in the termination proceeding, the trial court also was required to consider how conditions have changed since the time the orders were entered. In re Tyson, 76 N.C. App. 411, 416-17, 333 S.E.2d 554, 557-58 (1985).\nId. at 287, 576 S.E.2d at 407.\nJust as in Shermer, the trial court here failed to \u201cconsider any evidence of changed conditions in light of the evidence of prior neglect and the probability of a repetition of neglect.\u201d See Ballard, 311 N.C. at 715, 319 S.E.2d at 232. Thus, as in Shermer,\nwe conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect at the time of the hearing and, in turn, that those facts do not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that respondent neglected [George and Sam] within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-101(15).\n156 N.C. App. at 288, 576 S.E.2d at 408. We therefore reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s order terminating respondent-father\u2019s parental rights. Because we reverse, we need not address respondent-father\u2019s remaining arguments.\nREVERSED.\nJudges HUNTER, Robert C. and ERVIN concur.\n. We will refer to the minor children G.B.R. and S.D.R. by the pseudonyms George and Sam to protect the children\u2019s identity and for ease of reading.\n.

We affirm.\nI. Background\nOn 29 July 2009, defendant was charged with misdemeanor failure to file/pay income taxes. After his subsequent arrest, defendant posted a $5,000 appearance bond which was issued by Financial Casualty & Surety.\nOn 21 January 2010, defendant failed to appear in court as required and an order for arrest (\u201cOFA\u201d) was issued. However, the OFA was recalled that same day by the district court judge and the failure to appear was stricken. On 11 May 2010, defendant again failed to appear in court, a new OFA was issued, and his case was rescheduled for 30 June 2010. Defendant again failed to appear on that date.\nDefendant was subsequently re-arrested on the OFA. On 19 August 2010, the bail agent for surety issued defendant a $20,000 bond and defendant was released from custody. Defendant\u2019s release order included a finding by the magistrate that defendant had previously failed to appear two or more times in the instant case.\nOn 25 August 2010, defendant again failed to appear at his scheduled court appearance, and an OFA was issued. The bond issued by surety was forfeited. On 14 October 2010, surety filed a motion to set aside the forfeiture. The motion was opposed by the Wake County Board of Education.\nAfter a hearing, the trial court denied surety\u2019s motion. The court concluded that surety had notice, via the release order, of defendant\u2019s previous failures to appear and that, as a result, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5(f) required the court to deny surety\u2019s motion. Surety appeals.\nII. Standard of Review\nIn a hearing on a motion to set aside a bond forfeiture, \u201cthe standard of review for this Court is whether there was competent evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and whether its conclusions of law were proper in light of such facts.\u201d State v. Dunn, 200 N.C. App. 606, 608, 685 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2009).\nIII. Bond Forfeiture\nSurety argues that the trial court erred by denying its motion to set aside defendant\u2019s bond forfeiture. We disagree.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5 governs the procedure under which a bond forfeiture may be set aside. This statute specifically forbids the trial court from setting aside a bond forfeiture under certain circumstances:\n(f) Set Aside Prohibited in Certain Circumstances. \u2014 No forfeiture of a bond may be set aside for any reason in any case in which the surety or the bail agent had actual notice before executing a bail bond that the defendant had already failed to appear on two or more prior occasions in the case for which the bond was executed. Actual notice as required by this subsection shall only occur if two or more failures to appear are indicated on the defendant\u2019s release order by a judicial official. The judicial official shall indicate on the release order when it is the defendant\u2019s second or subsequent failure to appear in the case for which the bond was executed.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5(f) (2011). In the instant case, the trial court relied upon this provision in concluding that surety was not entitled to relief from forfeiture. Surety contends that this conclusion was erroneous and that the trial court\u2019s order included several findings of fact which were not supported by competent evidence.\nA. Failure to Appear\nSurety first challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant had previously failed to appear on 11 May 2010 and 30 June 2010. Surety argues that the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant failed to appear on 30 June 2010 is not supported by any evidence.\nThe trial court based its finding that defendant had failed to appear on 30 June 2010 upon a notation on the outside of defendant\u2019s district court file (\u201cshuck\u201d). The notation, \u201cCF 6-30-10,\u201d meant that defendant\u2019s name had been called out in district court and he failed to respond on that date. Surety contends that this notation was insufficient because the shuck did not also contain an OFA for defendant after he failed to appear on that date. Surety argues that an OFA is statutorily required when a defendant fails to appear and that without an OFA, the trial court could not find that defendant failed to appear.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-305 governs OFAs. Under this statute, \u201c[a]n order for arrest may be issued when ... [a] defendant who has been arrested and released from custody pursuant to Article 26 of this Chapter, Bail, fails to appear as required.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-305 (2011) (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to surety\u2019s argument, this statute does not require a court to issue an OFA when a defendant fails to appear. It merely permits the court to do so. See Felton v. Felton, 213 N.C. 194, 198, 195 S.E. 533, 536 (1938) (\u201cThe word \u2018may\u2019 as used in statutes in its ordinary sense is permissive and not mandatory.\u201d). Accordingly, surety\u2019s argument that an OFA was required to be issued after defendant failed to appear on 30 June 2010 is without merit.\nIn the instant case, it is undisputed that defendant failed to appear on 11 May 2010, and that as a result, the court issued an OFA. That OFA was still outstanding when defendant failed to appear on his next scheduled court date, 30 June 2010. Consequently, it was unnecessary for the trial court to issue a second OFA. Defendant\u2019s shuck clearly notes that he failed to appear in court as required on 30 June 2010. This notation fully supports the trial court\u2019s finding. This argument is overruled.\nB. Notice of Defendant\u2019s Failure to Appear\nSurety next contends that the trial court erred in finding that surety had actual knowledge that defendant had already failed to appear on two or more occasions before surety executed defendant\u2019s bond. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5(f), \u201c[a]ctual notice as required by this subsection shall only occur if two or more failures to appear are indicated on the defendant\u2019s release order by a judicial official.\u201d\nSurety does not dispute that defendant\u2019s release order contains an explicit finding that \u201cdefendant was arrested or surrendered after failing to appear in a prior release order .. . two or more times in this case.\u201d Rather, surety claims that it determined after an independent investigation that this finding was erroneous. Surety states that its agent performed a search of the court system\u2019s computerized database and determined that defendant had only forfeited a bond once previously, for defendant\u2019s failure to appear on 11 May 2010. There was no information in the database regarding defendant\u2019s failure to appear on 30 June 2010. Surety contends that since the database did not indicate a forfeiture for 30 June 2010 and there was no OFA for that date placed in defendant\u2019s shuck, its agent should have been free to disregard the finding on the release order.\nHowever, surety\u2019s reasoning is inconsistent with the plain language of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5(f). The statute only requires a finding on a release order \u201cwhen it is the defendant\u2019s second or subsequent failure to appear in the case for which the bond was executed.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5(f) (2011)(emphasis added). Thus, it is only a defendant\u2019s failure to appear in court that is relevant to the judicial official who is entering a release order. The statute contains no requirements regarding the number of bond forfeitures or OFAs, and we may not judicially impose such additional requirements. See State v. Davis, 364 N.C. 297, 302, 698 S.E.2d 65, 68 (2010)(\u201c[C]ourts must give [an unambiguous] statute its plain and definite meaning, and are without power to interpolate, or superimpose, provisions and limitations not contained therein.\u201d (internal quotations and citation omitted)). Accordingly, the fact that surety\u2019s investigation only revealed one prior bond forfeiture and one prior OFA is immaterial. As previously noted, defendant\u2019s shuck provided sufficient evidence that defendant had failed to appear on 11 May 2010 and 30 June 2010, and thus, the finding on defendant\u2019s release order was proper.\nSince defendant\u2019s release order included a finding, supported by the evidence from his shuck, which reflected that he had previously failed to appear on two or more occasions, the trial court properly found that surety had actual notice as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5(f). This finding, in turn, supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that surety was not entitled to relief from forfeiture. This argument is overruled.\nIV. Conclusion\nThe trial court\u2019s finding of fact that defendant had failed to appear on two prior occasions was supported by competent evidence, because defendant\u2019s shuck demonstrated that he had failed to appear on 11 May 2010 and 30 June 2010. Moreover, defendant\u2019s prior failures to appear were noted on his release order, and therefore supported the trial court\u2019s finding that surety had actual notice as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5(f). Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-544.5(f) barred surety from having the forfeiture set aside. The trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nJudges BRYANT and STROUD concur.", "author": "CALABRIA, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

As the oral findings of the trial court do not reflect the legal standard required by controlling caselaw, we remand to the trial court for a new trial.\nDefendant was indicted for robbery with a dangerous weapon. Defendant\u2019s case first came on for trial on 21 February 2011. However, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, and the trial court declared a mistrial on 23 February 2011.\nThe trial court proposed setting the retrial of defendant to begin the next day, 24 February 2011. Defendant objected, arguing in part that he wanted a transcript of the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses from the first trial before starting the retrial. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objections and set the retrial to begin the next day.\nThe next morning, defendant renewed his request for a transcript of the first trial, and that request was again denied. The jury for the second trial found defendant guilty. The trial court sentenced him to a presumptive-range term of 67 to 90 months imprisonment. Defendant timely appealed to this Court.\nDefendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for a transcript of the proceedings in his first trial prior to any retrial. Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion violated his constitutional right to present a complete defense and the constitutional requirement that the State provide him with the basic tools of an adequate defense. We agree.\nIt is well established that \u201cthe State must, as a matter of equal protection, provide indigent prisoners with the basic tools of an adequate defense or appeal, when those tools are available for a price to other prisoners.\u201d Britt v. North Carolina, 404 U.S. 226, 227, 30 L. Ed. 2d 400, 403, 92 S. Ct. 431, 433 (1971). These basic tools include \u201ca transcript of prior proceedings when that transcript is needed for an effective defense or appeal.\u201d Id.\nIn determining whether a transcript must be provided to an indigent defendant, the courts must apply a two-step test and decide: \u201c(1) whether a transcript is necessary for preparing an effective defense and (2) whether there are alternative devices available to the defendant which are substantially equivalent to a transcript.\u201d State v. Rankin, 306 N.C. 712, 716, 295 S.E.2d 416, 419 (1982). When a trial court denies a defendant\u2019s motion for a transcript of prior proceedings \u201cwithout evidence or findings that defendant had no need for a transcript or that there was available to defendant a substantially equivalent alternative\u201d and proceeds without defendant\u2019s having been furnished a transcript of the prior proceedings, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. State v. Reid, 312 N.C. 322, 323, 321 S.E.2d 880, 881 (1984).\nHere, at the close of the first trial, the trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection to his immediate retrial without a copy of the transcript, stating:\nI do not find that the anticipation or the speculation that a witness may get on the stand and alter their testimony to be sufficient basis to delay a trial so that a transcript can be produced. If in fact testimony is altered and there is some, prejudice that can be shown, or the need for a transcript \u2014 and obviously, this last trial was of record and we can take measures to ensure that the rights of all parties are adequately protected. So for those reasons, I\u2019m going to overrule the objections and start this trial at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow.\nAt the beginning of the retrial, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s renewed request for a transcript, stating:\nAnd again, if needing a transcript of a prior trial is based on speculation that a witness will take the stand and alter their testimony to be inconsistent from that which they gave at a prior trial, at this point that is just pure speculation. If that occurs, there are means that we can take to ensure that the defendant\u2019s due process rights are protected.\nWe hold that these findings are not sufficient under the Rankin two-part test. Defendant, in this case, argued he needed the transcript to effectively cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses, just as the defend ant in Reid argued. Id. The trial court\u2019s ruling in this case that defendant\u2019s asserted need constituted mere speculation that a witness might change his or her testimony would apply in almost every case. A defendant would rarely if ever be able to show that the State\u2019s witnesses would in fact change their testimony. The trial court\u2019s ruling makes no determination why, in this particular case, defendant had no need for a transcript, especially in light of the fact that the State\u2019s case rested entirely on the victim\u2019s identification of defendant as the perpetrator.\nFurther, the finding that the trial court could take \u201cmeasures\u201d or had \u201cmeans\u201d to protect defendant\u2019s rights, without any explanation of what those measures or means would be, is not sufficient to establish that there were alternative devices available to defendant that were substantially equivalent to a transcript. Accordingly, defendant is entitled to a new trial. See id. (\u201cUnder these circumstances, requiring defendant to be retried without providing him with a transcript of his first trial is error entitling defendant to a new trial.\u201d). Because of our disposition of this appeal, we need not address defendant\u2019s remaining argument.\nNew trial.\nJudges BRYANT and ROBERT N.

After careful consideration, we affirm the order of the superior court.\nPetitioner was employed as an instructional assistant/bus driver by the Lee County Schools. In November 2009, the Superintendent of the Lee County Schools dismissed petitioner from her employment after determining that she was medically unable to drive a school bus and thus could not fulfill all of the essential functions of her job. The Lee County Board of Education (respondent) ratified the superintendent\u2019s decision. Petitioner appealed to respondent, but respondent upheld the superintendent\u2019s decision, notifying petitioner of its decision by letter dated 13 January 2010.\nOn 1 October 2010, petitioner filed a complaint and petition for judicial review. In her complaint, petitioner alleged that respondent had breached its contract with her. In her petition for judicial review, petitioner alleged that respondent had acted unlawfully and upon unlawful procedure, and thus she was entitled to judicial review of its decision.\nRespondent moved to dismiss both the complaint and the petition for judicial review. The superior court granted respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for judicial review after finding it untimely and entered final judgment with respect to that claim pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 54(b). However, the superior court denied respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, and respondent has not appealed that decision. Accordingly, we consider only whether the superior court properly dismissed the petition for judicial review.\nPetitioner filed her petition for judicial review pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-45(c), which states that \u201c[a]n appeal shall lie to the local board of education from any final administrative decision\u201d when the petitioner has \u201calleged violation of a specified federal law, State law, State Board of Education policy, State rule, or local board policy[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C~45(c) (2011). Following an appeal of right to a local board of education, a petitioner may further appeal\nto the superior court of the State on the grounds that the local board\u2019s decision is in violation of constitutional provisions, is in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the board, is made upon unlawful procedure, is affected by other error of law, is unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted, or is arbitrary or capricious.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-45(c) (2011).\nHere, petitioner appealed to the superior court after the respondent local board of education affirmed the superintendent\u2019s decision to terminate her employment. In her appeal, petitioner alleged that respondent had acted unlawfully and upon unlawful procedure when it terminated her employment. Specifically, she alleged that respondent acted unlawfully by (1) violating N.C. Gen. Stat. Chapter 168A and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by discriminating against her on the basis of her disabling condition, (2) violating N.C. Gen. Stat. Chapter 168A and the ADA by failing to provide reasonable accommodations, and (3) misapplying Board Policy 7400.\nThe superior court dismissed the petition as untimely after first determining that petitions for judicial review brought under \u00a7 115C-45(c) are subject to the thirty-day time limit set out in \u00a7 150B-45(a). The superior court also found that petitioner had not shown good cause for the court to accept her untimely petition. Section 115C-45(c) does not contain a time limit, so the superior court looked to the time limit set out in Article 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Under the APA, a person seeking judicial review of a final decision under Article 4 of the APA \u201cmust file a petition within 30 days after the person is served with a written copy of the decision.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 150B-45(a) (2011). Although local boards of education are generally excluded from the requirements of the APA, see N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 115C-2, 150B-2(la) (2011), our appellate courts have consistently applied the standards for judicial review set out in \u00a7 150A-51 to appeals from school boards to the courts, e.g., Overton v. Board of Education, 304 N.C. 312, 316-17, 283 S.E.2d 495, 498 (1981). As the Supreme Court explained in Overton, because \u201cno other statute provides guidance for judicial review of school board decisions and in the interest of uniformity in reviewing administrative board decisions,\u201d the courts \u201capply the standards of review set forth in G.S. 150A-51 [.]\" Id.\nSimilarly, here, no other statute provides guidance for the judicial review of school board decisions, so the superior court, following Overton, properly looked to Article 4 of the APA to determine the correct time limit for appealing from school boards to the courts. That time limit is thirty days, and petitioner filed her petition nine months after respondent issued its decision, well outside the thirty-day limit. Accordingly, the superior court properly dismissed the petition as untimely.\nAffirmed.\nJudges BRYANT and ERVIN concur.\n. This is consistent with recent amendments to Chapter 115C, which apply the APA\u2019s judicial review standards to certain student appeals under \u00a7 115C-45 and specifically state that such appeals must be brought within thirty days of the local school board\u2019s decision.

Ewing of Ewing Law Firm, P.C., for defendant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "ELMORE, Judge.\nSheri McGaha Smalley (defendant) appeals from a judgment entered upon a jury conviction of one count of embezzlement. We find no error.\nIn 1997, Chris Manus started Manus Contracting, Inc. (the company). In 2004, Manus hired defendant to handle the company\u2019s finances. Manus gave defendant a signature stamp so that she could sign checks for the company, and defendant was responsible for taking the money that came into the company and distributing it as needed. She worked primarily from her home.\nIn October 2005, Manus informed defendant that the company no longer needed her services. Manus then requested that defendant return the company\u2019s materials to him. However, defendant did not return any of the materials until August 2006, and the materials she returned were incomplete. As a result, Manus contacted Deputy Lori Pierce of the Union County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Deputy Pierce investigated the company\u2019s bank records, and discovered that defendant had written numerous checks to herself. Deputy Pierce estimated that defendant had paid herself approximately $18,540.00 more than her agreed upon salary.\nIn July 2007, defendant was arrested for embezzling the company\u2019s funds. On 8 March 2011, her case came on for trial by jury. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s evidence, defendant moved to dismiss the charges against her for insufficiency of the evidence. The trial court denied her motion. Defendant did not present any evidence at trial, and at the conclusion of all evidence she renewed her motion. The trial court again denied the motion. Defendant was then convicted of one count of embezzlement. The trial court sentenced her to 6-8 months imprisonment, but suspended the sentence on condition that defendant serve a split sentence of 60 days imprisonment and be placed on 36 months supervised probation. Defendant now appeals.\n\u201cThis Court reviews the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss de novo\u201d State v. Smith, 186 N.C. App. 57, 62, 650 S.E.2d 29, 33 (2007). \u201cUpon defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal, the question for the Court is whether there is substantial evidence (1) of each essential element of the offense charged, or of a lesser offense included therein, and (2) of defendant\u2019s being the perpetrator of such offense. If so, the motion is properly denied.\u201d State v. Fritsch, 351 N.C. 373, 378, 526 S.E.2d 451, 455, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 890, 148 L. Ed. 2d 150 (2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d State v. Smith, 300 N.C. 71, 78, 265 S.E.2d 164, 169 (1980). \u201cIn making its determination, the trial court must consider all evidence admitted, whether competent or incompetent, in the light most favorable to the State, giving the State the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving any contradictions in its favor.\u201d State v. Rose, 339 N.C. 172, 192, 451 S.E.2d 211, 223 (1994), cert denied, 515 U.S. 1135, 132 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1995).\nDefendant first argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss because the State failed to prove that defendant was an agent of the company. Specifically, defendant argues that she was an independent contractor and was therefore not a servant or agent under the embezzlement statute. We disagree.\nAccording to our General Statutes, a person may be criminally liable for the embezzlement of property from a corporation if that person is an agent of the corporation. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-90 (2011). \u201cTwo essential elements of an agency relationship are: (1) the authority of the agent to act on behalf of the principal, and (2) the principal\u2019s control over the agent.\u201d State v. Weaver, 359 N.C. 246, 258, 607 S.E.2d 599, 606 (2005) (citation omitted).\nHere, the State\u2019s evidence showed the following: 1) defendant \u201chad full access to [the company\u2019s] checking accounts\u201d; 2) defendant \u201ccould write checks on her own\u201d; 3) defendant \u201cwould delegate the funds\u201d of the company. Thus, we conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence to show that defendant had the authority to act on behalf of the corporation. The State also presented sufficient evidence to prove that the company had control over defendant\u2019s performance. At trial, Manus expl\u00e1ined that defendant had several responsibilities he expected her to meet. Manus also testified that he spoke to defendant \u201c[i]n person probably once a week. By telephone, I probably talked to her three, four times a week, sometimes a lot more than that. If she had a question, she would call me.\u201d We conclude that when this evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State, it is sufficient to prove that the company had the ability to control defendant\u2019s performance.\nIn sum, the State\u2019s evidence shows that defendant was an agent of the company and not an independent contractor. As a result, we conclude that the trial court did not err with regards to this issue.\nDefendant next argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss because the State failed to prove that she received into her possession lawfully the personal property of the company. We disagree.\nTo be guilty of embezzlement, \u201c[t]he person accused must have . . . received into his possession lawfully the personal property of another])]\u201d Id. at 255, 607 S.E.2d at 604 (2005) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). This Court has held that \u201cthe possession required by [statute] to make out a prima facie case of embezzlement may be actual or constructive possession.\u201d State v. Jackson, 57 N.C. App. 71, 77, 291 S.E.2d 190, 194 (1982) (citation omitted). \u201cConstructive possession of goods exists without actual personal dominion over them, but with an intent and capability to maintain control and dominion over them.\u201d Id. at 76, 291 S.E.2d at 194 (quotations and citations omitted).\nIn Jackson, we held that the defendant had constructive possession of the corporation\u2019s goods when, while acting as an agent of the corporation and during the course of his employment there, he took deliveries of meat for the corporation, signed the invoices, and arranged for the diversion of the meat to various places. See Id. at 77, 291 S.E.2d at 194.\nHere, the State\u2019s evidence showed that defendant was given complete access to the corporation\u2019s accounts. She was also able to write checks on behalf of the corporation and to delegate where the corporation\u2019s money went. Thus, we conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence to prove that defendant had constructive posses sion of the corporation\u2019s money according to our holding in Jackson.\nIn sum, we conclude that defendant had lawful constructive possession of the company\u2019s funds, because she was able to maintain control and dominion of the funds. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err with reg\u00e1rds to this issue.\nNo error.\nJudges STEELMAN and STROUD concur.", "author": "ELMORE, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Watson, for defendant-appellant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "GEER, Judge.\nDefendant Michael Raus appeals the trial court\u2019s order requiring specific performance of the separation agreement he entered into with plaintiff Simone Praver. Mr. Raus contends on appeal that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are inadequate to support its order of specific performance in that the trial court made no finding that Ms. Praver\u2019s remedies at law were inadequate. Mr. Raus has failed to distinguish between the order\u2019s requirement that he pay arrearages due under the agreement and its requirement that he make future payments as they come due. Under controlling Supreme Court authority, the trial court was required to make a finding that Ms. Praver had no adequate remedy at law with respect to the arrearages but not as to the prospective payments. Because we find Mr. Raus\u2019 remaining arguments unpersuasive, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part for further findings as to the adequacy of Ms. Praver\u2019s remedies at law with respect to arrearages.\nFacts\nMs. Praver and Mr. Raus were married 14 December 1985 and had three children. They separated on 10 January 2004 and entered into a separation agreement on 5 March 2004. The agreement provided, inter alia, for Mr. Raus (1) to pay child support in the amount of $1,500.00 per month from March 2004 until certain specified terminating events or upon a showing of a substantial change in circumstances under North Carolina law, and (2) to pay alimony in the amount of $4,500.00 per month from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2014, as well as 30% of Mr. Raus1 gross income over $240,000.00, unless specified terminating events occurred.\nOn 22 August 2006, Ms. Praver filed a verified complaint alleging that Mr. Raus had, in violation of the separation agreement, failed (1) to pay alimony and child support with a total past-due amount of $130,470.00; (2) to pay the children\u2019s orthodontic expenses; (3) to maintain $500,000.00 in life insurance on himself for the benefit of the children\u2019s college education; and (4) to maintain life insurance equal to the remainder of his alimony obligation for Ms. Praver\u2019s benefit. Ms. Praver sought an order requiring specific performance of the separation agreement.\nMr. Raus filed an answer and counterclaim on 18 January 2007, asserting several affirmative defenses to enforcement of the separation agreement. Included among the affirmative defenses were Mr. Raus\u2019 claims that the separation agreement was the result of duress and undue influence and that throughout the lifetime of the agreement Mr. Raus had a continuous inability to perform his obligations under the agreement. In addition, Mr. Raus asserted a counterclaim seeking rescission of the agreement on the grounds that the agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable.\nThe trial court entered an order on 2 December 2010 concluding in pertinent part:\n2. The Defendant breached the parties\u2019 separation agreement by failing to pay the monthly amounts owed for alimony and child support, by the greater weight of evidence.\n3. The Defendant\u2019s [sic] was not under duress at the time he entered into this agreement. In addition, this agreement was neither procedurally or substantively unconscionable.\n4. The Defendant has the means and ability to perform the support terms of this agreement at the time the agreement was entered into and currently.\n5. The Defendant is voluntarily suppressing his income with the intent to deprive the Plaintiff of support.\n6. The Defendant has the means and ability to specifically perform the terms and conditions of this agreement.\nBased upon its conclusions of law, the trial court ordered Mr. Raus to pay $500.00 per month towards his alimony arrearages of $311,840.00 and his child support arrearages of $96,000.00. It further ordered Mr. Raus to pay $1,500.00 in child support and $4,500.00 in alimony by the first of each month, to pay $10,000.00 in Ms. Praver\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, and to inform Ms. Praver and her counsel when he became employed so that his obligations could be satisfied by withholding. Mr. Raus timely appealed to this Court.\nI\nMr. Raus first contends that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact do not support its conclusion that Mr. Raus was not acting under duress when he signed the separation agreement. See Fletcher v. Fletcher, 23 N.C. App. 207, 210, 208 S.E.2d 524, 527 (1974) (\u201cDuress may take the form of unlawfully inducing one to make a contract or to perform some other act against his own.free will. It may be manifested by threats or by the exhibition of force which apparently cannot be resisted.\u201d).\nWhen a trial court sits without a jury, we review \u201cthe trial court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Shipman v. Shipman, 357 N.C. 471, 474, 586 S.E.2d 250, 253 (2003). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting State v. Smith, 300 N.C. 71, 78-79, 265 S.E.2d 164, 169 (1980)). If the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, then those findings \u201c \u2018are conclusive on appeal if there is evidence to support them, even though the evidence might sustain findings to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d Pulliam v. Smith, 348 N.C. 616, 625, 501 S.E.2d 898, 903 (1998) (quoting Williams v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 288 N.C. 338, 342, 218 S.E.2d 368, 371 (1975)).\nIn support of its conclusion that Mr. Raus was not under duress at the time he entered into the separation agreement, the trial court made the following relevant findings of fact:\n4. As a threshold matter, the Court heard testimony regarding the Defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses. The Defendant\u2019s arguments revolved mainly about the fact that tbe Plaintiff was represented and the Defendant were [sic] pro-se. The Defendant testified that he did not have the ability to contract because he was [] depressed and took Effexor, Zoloft, Ambien and used a C-pap machine for sleep apnea. He also testified he was under duress, but \u201cthe Plaintiff did not put a gun to my head\u201d in signing the Contract. The Court notes that it would be unusual for him not to be depressed at the end of a marriage and if she voided the agreement of every depressed litigant, then almost every agreement which cam[e] before the Court would have to be voided.\n5. The Defendant failed to offer any evidence that any of the defenses were related to anything, which the Plaintiff had done to the Defendant. His issues were attributed to certain outside forces, which prevented him from knowing what he was doing when he signed the agreement.\n6. However the Defendant testified that the $1,500 amount for child support was fair and 30% of his income for alimony was also reasonable. He readily admitted that he understood the terms of the agreement and knew what he was signing.\n8. He also testified that he voluntarily got out of bed, put on his close [sic], got in his vehicle alone and drove to the bank to sign the separation agreement at a bank.\nThe trial court also found, in finding of fact 9, that Mr. Raus was a businessman who at various times had owned three businesses and had sufficient funds to live in a $1.5 million home and send his two children to private school. Additionally, the trial court found in finding of fact 10: \u201c[Mr. Raus] freely and voluntarily knew what he was signing; he was not under any duress when he signed the agreement and the agreement was not unconscionable given [sic] procedurally or substantively when looking at the agreement in its totality.\u201d\nMr. Raus argues that to the extent findings of fact 4, 6, and 8 summarize defendant\u2019s testimony, they are not proper findings of fact because they are mere recitations of testimony, citing Long v. Long, 160 N.C. App. 664, 588 S.E.2d 1 (2003), and Chloride, Inc. v. Honeycutt, 71 N.C. App. 805, 323 S.E.2d 368 (1984). In those cases, the findings were inadequate because the trial court did not, with a mere recitation of testimony, resolve the conflicts in the evidence and actually find facts. Id. at 805, 323 S.E.2d at 368-69. That is not, however, the case here.\nFindings of fact 4, 6, and 8 summarize admissions by Mr. Raus relating to the voluntary nature of his actions, including his admission that the separation agreement was fair, that he understood the agreement, that he voluntarily went to sign the agreement and that he was not acting under duress when signing it. With respect to Mr. Raus\u2019 testimony about his depression and medications, the court did \u2014 after reciting that testimony \u2014 resolve the dispute it raised by determining that it was not entitled to much weight. In short, the court did not err in setting out those portions of Mr. Raus\u2019 testimony that defeated his affirmative defense of duress and in explaining why it found his evidence in support of duress inadequate.\nMr. Raus also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support finding of fact 9 and finding of fact 10, regarding his financial status at the time he entered into the separation agreement and the lack of duress and unconscionability. These findings are supported by Mr. Raus\u2019 own testimony as well as representations in the separation agreement that Mr. Raus has not specifically challenged. Although Mr. Raus points to testimony that supports his contentions and argues that his evidence is entitled to greater weight, we may not accept his invitation to substitute our own judgment for that of the trial court. Since the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by evidence, they are binding.\nMr. Raus makes no further argument regarding his affirmative defense of duress. We, therefore, hold that the trial court did not err in declining to set aside the separation agreement based on duress.\nII\nMr. Raus next contends that the trial court should not have concluded that he was in breach of the separation agreement. Mr. Raus argues that the evidence shows he lacked the ability to perform under the agreement.\nThe trial court determined, in finding of fact 13, that Mr. Raus owed Ms. Praver $96,000.00 in child support and $311,840.00 in alimony. With respect to Mr. Raus\u2019 ability to pay the amounts due under the agreement, the trial court found:\n14. Soon after the parties [sic] into the separation agreement, the Defendant\u2019s family\u2019s business shut down for some inexplicable reason; this was the business in which the Defendant earned an income of at least $240,000 per year. As a result the Defendant indicated that he did not have the financial ability to comply with the ongoing support obligations of the agreement.\n15. However, since the time that his business shut down, he has had at least 4 well paying jobs. In addition, he has lived rent free in a town-home owned by his brother. He has also continually had an American Express card in his name but paid by his mother, which [sic] he charges his living expenses.\n16. Up through 2007, he sent of [sic] his children to private secondary school and purchased for them whatever they wanted and/or needed. He did this all at the same time that he paid less then [sic] 10% of his total support obligation to the Plaintiff.\n17. The Defendant moved to Kentucky to live with his girlfriend and her three children several months ago. The Defendant had a job working for Jewish Hospital in Kentucky up through one month prior to trial. He was earning at least $60,000 a year at this job plus an unknown amount of potential bonus and/or commission. While working in Kentucky, he is living in his girlfriend\u2019s residence and her children\u2019s residence, rent-free. He pays a portion of the utilities, has a car payment of $437 per month and pays 20-30 per week in fuel costs. The Defendant still has the American express credit card to pay his expenses and which his mother pays for. He also pays his child\u2019s college expense and living expenses of $1,000-$1,500 per month which he has consistently done for over one year.\nMr. Raus argues that these findings of fact, as well as finding of fact 13, are not supported by the evidence. Based on our review of the record, we hold that each finding is. supported by the terms of the separation agreement itself, Mr. Raus\u2019s answer, or his own testimony. The findings are, therefore, binding on appeal notwithstanding the existence of conflicting evidence.\nIndeed, Mr. Raus does not actually contest that he failed to pay the amounts owed, but rather argues only that his performance was excused because of an inability to pay. In support of this position, he points to his actual income and argues that under Cavenaugh v. Cavenaugh, 317 N.C. 652, 347 S.E.2d 19 (1986), the trial court should not have found him in breach of the agreement. In Cavenaugh, this Court reviewed a trial court\u2019s order requiring defendant to pay all arrearages due under a separation agreement and to make periodic payments in the future as provided under the agreement. Id. at 656-58, 347 S.E.2d at 22-24. Although in that particular case, the Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s order did not adequately address the defendant\u2019s evidence that, based on his actual income, he was unable to fulfill his obligations under the agreement, id. at 657-58, 347 S.E.2d at 23, the Court also noted that when the supporting spouse deliberately suppresses income or dissipates resources, then the trial court may rely upon the spouse\u2019s capacity to earn rather than his or her actual income. Id. at 657, 347 S.E.2d at 23 (citing Quick v. Quick, 305 N.C. 446, 290 S.E.2d 653 (1982)).\nThis Court applied that principle in Condellone v. Condellone, 129 N.C. App. 675, 682, 501 S.E.2d 690, 695-96 (1998) (quoting Cavenaugh, 317 N.C. at 658, 347 S.E.2d at 23), explaining that \u201c[i]n the absence of a finding that the defendant is able to perform a separation agreement, the trial court may nonetheless order specific performance if it can find that the defendant \u2018has deliberately depressed his income or dissipated his resources.\u2019 \u201d The Court further clarified that \u201c[i]n finding that the defendant is able to perform a separation agreement, the trial court is not required to make a specific finding of the defendant\u2019s present ability to comply as that phrase is used in the context of civil contempt.\u201d Id. at 683, 501 S.E.2d at 696 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court then held that despite there being no evidence of the defendant\u2019s current income, the trial court\u2019s finding of a pattern of conduct to depress his income was sufficient to support its order of specific performance as to future payments and arrearages owed under the separation agreement. Id. at 683-84, 501 S.E.2d at 696.\nHere, while Mr. Raus presented evidence of an inability to pay, the trial court found, based on other evidence, \u201cthat the Defendant is voluntarily unemployed with the intent of depriving the Plaintiff of support.\u201d It was up to the trial court to decide the credibility of Mr. Raus\u2019 claim of an inability to pay. Since the court made the findings required by Gavenaugh based on the evidence presented, it was not required to make findings regarding Mr. Raus\u2019 present ability to comply with the separation agreement. The trial court, therefore, did not err in concluding that Mr. Raus had breached the separation agreement.\nIll\nMr. Raus next challenges the trial court\u2019s order of specific performance on the grounds that the order contains (1) no findings of fact regarding whether Ms. Praver fully complied with her obligations under the separation agreement, and (2) no determination whether Ms. Praver\u2019s remedy at law was inadequate. Mr. Raus contends that in the absence of these findings, the court was prohibited from ordering specific performance of the separation agreement.\nWith respect to whether Ms. Praver was required to prove and the trial court to find, as a prerequisite to specific performance by Mr. Raus, that Ms. Praver had performed all of her obligations under the separation agreement, our Supreme Court in Gavenaugh observed in dicta that \u201c[s]pecific performance is available to a party only if that party has alleged and proven that he has performed his obligations under the contract. . . .\u201d Cavenaugh, 317 N.C. at 656-57, 347 S.E.2d at 22. Although no evidence was presented at trial that Ms. Praver had violated any term of the separation agreement, Mr. Raus asserts on appeal that Ms. Praver had an affirmative burden to prove her compliance under the agreement to warrant an order for specific performance.\nMr. Raus complains that \u201c[t]here are no allegations in Ms. Praver\u2019s Verified Complaint for Specific Performance addressing her performance under the Agreement.\u201d In the trial court, however, Mr. Raus never moved to dismiss Ms. Praver\u2019s claim for specific performance on that basis. Mr. Raus did allege in his answer, as his seventh affirmative defense, that \u201cPlaintiffs claims should be barred on the basis that she has breached material terms and conditions provided therein.\u201d He did not, however, present any evidence or make any argument to the trial court seeking a ruling on this contention. Further, when the trial court specifically asked Mr. Raus, who was appearing pro se, about that defense, Mr. Raus denied knowing to what the answer referred. Mr. Raus effectively abandoned any claim that Ms. Praver breached the agreement.\nMr. Raus has, therefore, failed to preserve this issue for appeal. See N.C.R. App. P. 10(a)(1) (\u201cIn order to preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection, or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context. It is also necessary for the complaining party to obtain a ruling upon the party\u2019s request, objection, or motion.\u201d). Accordingly, we decline to address this issue.\nMr. Raus also asserts that the trial court erred in making no determination that Ms. Praver\u2019s remedy at law was inadequate before ordering specific performance of the separation agreement. The specific performance order required both that Mr. Raus pay the arrearages due under the agreement and that he make prospective payments as they came due. Our courts have treated an order of specific performance to pay arrearages differently from an order of specific performance of prospective payments.\nOur Supreme Court held in Moore v. Moore, 297 N.C. 14, 252 S.E.2d 735 (1979), overruled on other grounds by Marks v. Marks, 316 N.C. 447, 342 S.E.2d 859 (1986), that because of the absence of an adequate remedy at law, specific performance was appropriate both as to arrearages and as to prospective payments. However, in Cavenaugh, 317 N.C. at 656-57, 347 S.E.2d at 22-23, the Supreme Court appeared to alter the rule as to arrearages and held that there had to be an evidentiary basis supporting a trial court\u2019s conclusion of law that no adequate remedy at law existed.\nIn Moore, our Supreme Court examined whether the trial court had properly denied the plaintiff an order of specific performance for enforcement of future payments and arrearages under a separation agreement that had not been incorporated into a judicial decree. 297 N.C. at 16, 252 S.E.2d at 737. The Court asked: \u201cWhat remedy at law is available to the plaintiff who seeks to compel compliance with a provision for periodic alimony payments in a separation agreement that has not been made part of a divorce judgment?\u201d Id. at 17, 252 S.E.2d at 738. The Court answered its question, observing that a plaintiff would have to wait until payments became due and the spouse did not pay them and then he or she would have to file suit, reduce the claim to judgment, and, if unpaid, proceed with execution on the judgment. Id. If the defendant persisted in not complying, the plaintiff would have to resort to the remedy repeatedly. Given the expense and delay in obtaining recovery of sums \u201cproviding for the plaintiffs basic subsistence,\u201d the Court held \u201cthat the remedy available at law involves unusual and extreme hardship.\u201d Id.\nWhile this analysis seemed to address primarily the requirement that the defendant make prospective payments, the Court then held that the trial court had erred in excluding evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s income, assets, and liabilities. Id. at 18, 252 S.E.2d at 738. Based on the excluded evidence, the Court also held that no adequate remedy at law existed as to the arrearages: \u201cThat evidence shows a deliberate pattern of conduct by defendant to defeat plaintiff\u2019s rights under their separation agreement. Execution upon plaintiff\u2019s judgments for arrearages cannot be enforced upon the property of defendant\u2019s second wife. Defendant deliberately, each payday, places his income out of reach of plaintiff\u2019s remedies at law.\u201d Id., 252 S.E.2d at 738-39. Consequently, the Court remanded \u201cfor entry of a decree ordering defendant to specifically perform his support obligations under the separation agreement, both as to the arrearages and future payments.\u201d Id. at 19, 252 S.E.2d at 739.\nIn Cavenaugh, our Supreme Court, as an initial matter, held that the trial court\u2019s order of specific performance of a separation agreement had to be remanded because of the trial court\u2019s failure to make \u201cfindings of fact on defendant\u2019s ability to pay the arrearages [due under the agreement] and to comply with the terms of the separation agreement in the future.\u201d 317 N.C. at 658, 347 S.E.2d at 23. The Court pointed out that if the trial court determined that the defendant lacked the ability to fulfill his obligations under the agreement, \u201cspecific performance of the entire agreement [could] not be ordered absent evidence that defendant ha[d] deliberately depressed his income or dissipated his resources.\u201d Id. On the other hand, the Court explained, if the court found that \u201cthe state of defendant\u2019s finances warranted] it, the trial judge [could] order specific performance of all or any part of the separation agreement unless plaintiff otherwise ha[d] an adequate remedy at law.\u201d Id.\nThe Court then examined the trial court\u2019s \u201cconclusion that plaintiff did not have an adequate remedy at law to collect the arrearages owed by defendant,\u201d which was based on a finding of fact that \u201cit would require \u2018a multiplicity of actions and legal processes . . .\u2019to effect collection of the judgment through execution.\u201d Id. The Court determined that there was no evidence to support that finding, and, therefore, the finding could not \u201cbe used to support a conclusion of law that the plaintiff does not have an adequate remedy at law . . . .\u201d Id. As a result, the trial court\u2019s \u201cdecree of specific performance for the arrearages\u201d failed for that reason as well as the failure to address the defendant\u2019s ability to comply with the agreement. Id., 347 S.E.2d at 23-24.\nThe leading North Carolina family law treatise has explained, citing Moore, that \u201c[b]ecause separation agreements often involve periodic payments, . . . the law recognizes that legal relief is usually inadequate, and the moving party has little difficulty with this element, especially for an order involving future payments.\" See 3 Suzanne Reynolds, Lee\u2019s North Carolina Family Law \u00a7 14.35b(ii), at 14-99 (5th ed. 2002) (emphasis added). With respect to arrearages, however, the treatise summarizes the law as follows: \u201cUnder appropriate facts, . . . the court has the power to order specific performance of arrearages as well as of future payments. Certainly, evidence of a pattern of defaults, of unsatisfied judgments, and of conduct to keep assets from execution on a judgment support the conclusion that the plaintiff has an inadequate remedy at law for both arrearages and future payments. If the order of specific performance involves only arrearages, there must be some evidence in the record to support the conclusion that collection would involve a multiplicity of suits.\" Id. (emphasis added).\nTherefore, under our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Cavenaugh, this case must be returned to the trial court for findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding whether Ms. Praver\u2019s remedy at law was inadequate with regard to the arrearages owed by Mr. Raus under the separation agreement. See Condellone, 129 N.C. App. at 684, 501 S.E.2d at 696 (holding that trial court has authority to order specific performance of arrearages in \u201cproper case\u201d). Under Moore, however, no findings of fact were necessary as to the adequacy of Ms. Praver\u2019s remedy at law for future payments. Any error in failing to include a conclusion of law can be remedied on remand. We, therefore, affirm the order of specific performance in part and reverse and remand it in part for further findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nIV\nDefendant\u2019s final contention is that the trial court failed to find sufficient facts to justify its award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Ms. Praver concedes that the findings are inadequate. We, therefore, reverse the attorneys\u2019 fees award and remand for further findings of fact and conclusions of law as to Ms. Praver\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. See Upchurch v. Upchurch, 34 N.C. App. 658, 665, 239 S.E.2d 701, 705 (1977) (\u201cIn order to award attorney fees in alimony cases the trial court must make findings of fact showing that fees are allowable and that the amount awarded is reasonable.\u201d).\nAffirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.\nChief Judge MARTIN and Judge STROUD concur.\n. We note that the separation agreement contained a provision stating that the parties agreed that \u201cneither party has a plain, speedy or adequate legal remedy to compel compliance with the provisions of this Agreement\u201d and \u201cthat an order for specific performance enforceable by contempt is an appropriate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party.\u201d Neither party has discussed the impact of this provision on the ability of the trial court to order specific performance and, therefore, we do not address it or express any opinion on its effect.", "author": "GEER, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["SIMONE PRAVER, Plaintiff v.

Defendant contends the State failed to prove that he was actually driving his car, an essential element of both crimes. Furthermore, he argues the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on the standard of reasonable doubt. For the following reasons, we disagree and find no error on behalf of the trial court.\nI. Background\nOn 24 October 2009, at around 5:00 a.m., Officer William Grosclose, who at the time had been a traffic officer with the Kinston Department of Public Safety for almost two years, was parked at Grainger Stadium in Kinston, North Carolina, approaching the end of his shift when he heard a loud boom. He was unsure of the cause of the noise and could not locate its origin. A few minutes later he received a call from dispatch alerting him to a wreck on Liberty Hall Road, about one to one-and-one-half miles away.\nOfficer Grosclose arrived at the scene of the accident to find a damaged 1989 Buick sedan in a ditch on the side of the road. Liberty Hall Road is a two-lane residential road and the vehicle was located near a curve and an intersection. Officer Grosclose noticed blood between the driver\u2019s seat and passenger seat, on the steering wheel, and on the back of the passenger seat. No one was in the car and there were not any keys in the ignition. The driver\u2019s side door was jammed closed, but the passenger door was wide open. Officer Grosclose looked up the registration for the vehicle, determined that it belonged to defendant, and obtained his address. He requested that other officers check defendant\u2019s residence, but they reported that no one was home. As the other officers tracked back from defendant\u2019s home to the scene of the accident, they located defendant on East Bright Street at approximately 5:30 a.m.\nOfficer Grosclose joined the other officers on East Bright Street and found defendant leaning against a patrol car. Defendant had an injury to the left side of his cheek, consistent with the impact of a steering wheel or seatbelt, and blood on his hands. Defendant\u2019s breath emanated a strong odor of alcohol. Additionally, according to Officer Grosclose, defendant appeared unsteady on his feet, slurred his speech, and refused to cooperate with the officers\u2019 investigation. Officer Grosclose proceeded to question defendant about the accident, to which he responded with a variety of stories. Defendant initially told Officer Grosclose that he had been at the Ponderosa Club when a fight broke out and his car had been stolen. He then changed his story to his friends having driven the car while he was a passenger. However, officers were unable to obtain any evidence that other people had been at the scene of the accident and the nearby hospitals did not have any reports of patients with injuries matching those possibly caused by the accident. Defendant finally admitted that he had driven the car because he had been jumped at the Ponderosa Club and he thought his life had been threatened. Officer Grosclose testified at trial that defendant\u2019s statements \u201cdidn\u2019t make sense\u201d and \u201cwouldn\u2019t piece together.\u201d Furthermore, they had \u201c[n]o logical order.\u201d\nOfficer Grosclose attempted to have defendant perform field sobriety tests, but he refused. Officer Grosclose testified that in his opinion defendant consumed a sufficient amount of alcohol such that his mental and physical faculties were impaired. As a result, he arrested defendant for DWI and DWLR. Following his arrest, defendant also refused a breathalyzer test. Officer Grosclose obtained a search warrant to test defendant\u2019s blood. At approximately 7:20 a.m., a paramedic withdrew defendant\u2019s blood. Melanie Thornton, a forensic chemist at the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab, testified that she analyzed defendant\u2019s blood and determined that it had a blood alcohol concentration of .18, over twice the legal limit in North Carolina. Defendant was eventually cited for DWI, DWLR, and misdemeanor hit and run.\nOn 4 October 2010, in Lenoir County District Court before Judge Lonnie Carraway, defendant was found guilty of DWI and DWLR, but acquitted of misdemeanor hit and run. Judge Carraway sentenced defendant as a Level 1 offender to consecutive sentences of twelve months for DWI and forty-five days for DWLR. Defendant appealed to the superior court. On 7 February 2011, Judge Paul L. Jones conducted a trial of defendant\u2019s case in Lenoir County Superior Court. The next day Judge Jones dismissed defendant\u2019s hit-and-run charge and ordered a mistrial for the DWI and DWLR charges due to a hung jury.\nOn 9 May 2011, defendant had his retrial before Judge Jones. At the end of all evidence defendant\u2019s counsel made a motion to dismiss asserting that there was \u201cnothing to link defendant to driving the car\u201d and that there was \u201cno evidence that anyone observed him driving the car.\u201d Judge Jones responded, \u201cWell, there was testimony by the officer that defendant] said he was driving.\u201d Consequently, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. On 12 May 2011, the jury returned guilty verdicts against defendant on the charges of DWI and DWLR. The trial court entered a consolidated sentence of twelve months for both charges. Defendant gave oral notice of appeal.\nII. Analysis\nA. Motion to Dismiss\nDefendant\u2019s first issue on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because the State failed to establish the corpus delicti of his DWI and DWLR charges. We disagree.\nOur Court reviews the denial of a motion to dismiss de novo. State v. Adams,_N.C. App._,_, 721 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2012). Under de novo review we consider the matter anew and freely substitute our own judgment for that of the lower court. Sutton v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 132 N.C. App. 387, 389, 511 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1999). To survive a motion to dismiss the State must provide substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense. State v. Davis, 74 N.C. App. 208, 212, 328 S.E.2d 11, 14 (1985). Our review of the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cis the same whether the evidence is circumstantial or direct, or both.\u201d State v. Garcia, 358 N.C. 382, 413, 597 S.E.2d 724, 746 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The evidence is to be viewed in the light most favorable to the State with the State receiving any reasonable inferences therefrom. Id. at 412-13, 597 S.E.2d at 746. Furthermore, when the evidence only raises a suspicion of guilt, a motion to dismiss must be granted. State v. Daniels, 300 N.C. 105, 114, 265 S.E.2d 217, 222 (1980), superseded, by statute on other grounds in State v. Wortham, 318 N.C. 669, 351 S.E.2d 294 (1987). However, \u201c[i]f there is more than a scintilla of competent evidence to support allegations in the warrant or indictment, it is the court\u2019s duty to submit the case to the jury.\u201d State v. Everhardt, 96 N.C. App. 1, 11, 384 S.E.2d 562, 568 (1989) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), aff\u2019d, 326 N.C. 777, 392 S.E.2d 391 (1990).\nDefendant argues the State failed to present substantial independent evidence that he drove his car on the morning of 24 October 2009. In making his argument, defendant contends the State may not solely rely on a naked, extrajudicial confession to support a criminal conviction. See State v. Cope, 240 N.C. 244, 247, 81 S.E.2d 773, 776 (1954). However, defendant argues the State must provide other corroborating evidence and in the case at hand the other evidence offered by the State does not substantiate defendant\u2019s single comment that he drove his car after being jumped at the Ponderosa Club. Id.\nUnder the corpus delicti rule, a conviction cannot be based solely on a defendant\u2019s confession. State v. Smith, 362 N.C. 583, 592, 669 S.E.2d 299, 305 (2008). Rather, \u201cother corroborating evidence is needed to convict for a criminal offense.\u201d Id. Moreover, in noncapital cases, a defendant\u2019s conviction will be upheld by the defendant\u2019s confession where the confession is supported by substantial independent evidence tending to establish its trustworthiness, including facts that the defendant had the opportunity to commit the crime. See State v. Trexler, 316 N.C. 528, 533, 342 S.E.2d 878, 881 (1986) (DWI conviction upheld where sufficient independent evidence existed to show that defendant appeared impaired, was actually impaired, and otherwise the wreck was unexplained).\nDefendant argues that his lone confession in the middle of his sequence of rambling excuses was not sufficient to meet the State\u2019s burden of proving that defendant actually drove his car.\nA person commits the offense of impaired driving if he drives any vehicle upon any highway, any street, or any public vehicular area within this State:\n(1) While under the influence of an impairing substance; or\n(2) After having consumed sufficient alcohol that he has, at any relevant time after the driving, an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more. The results of a chemical analysis shall be deemed sufficient evidence to prove a person\u2019s alcohol concentration; or\n(3) With any amount of a Schedule I controlled substance, as listed in G.S. 90 89, or its metabolites in his blood or urine.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-138.1(a) (2011). Additionally, any person is guilty of the crime of DWLR \u201cwhose drivers license has been revoked who drives any motor vehicle upon the highways of the State while the license is revoked[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-28(a) (2011). Defendant contends the State did not present sufficient evidence to corroborate his alleged confession and prove that it was trustworthy. In arguing so, defendant notes that his confession contradicted his previous statements; there were no eyewitnesses to him having driven the car or getting out of the driver\u2019s seat; he was not found with the keys to the vehicle in his possession, which can be a factor in determining if he drove, see State v. Sawyer, 230 N.C. 713, 715, 55 S.E.2d 464, 466 (1949); and his injuries did not establish that he was driving the car because the blood on the back of the passenger seat could have been from him sitting in the backseat. Defendant contends these discrepancies are merely suspicion and are not sufficient to meet the level of substantial evidence. State v. Hamilton, 145 N.C. App. 152, 158, 549 S.E.2d 233, 237 (2001).\nAlternatively, the State argues that it presented sufficient independent evidence tending to establish the corpus delicti of the crime charged. The State notes that\n\u201c[independent evidence of the corpus delicti ... does not equate with independent evidence as to each essential element of the offense charged. Applying the more traditional definition of corpus delicti, the requirement of corroborative evidence would be met if that evidence tended to establish the essential harm, and it would not be fatal to the State\u2019s case if some elements of the crime were proved solely by defendant\u2019s confession.\u201d\nState v. Highsmith, 173 N.C. App. 600, 604, 619 S.E.2d 586, 590 (2005) (quoting State v. Parker, 315 N.C. 222, 229 S.E.2d 487, 491 (1985)). The State contends it presented substantial evidence regarding the trustworthiness of defendant\u2019s statement and his opportunity to commit the crime. In particular, the State noted that the vehicle was registered to defendant; defendant was found walking on a road near the scene; defendant had injuries consistent with someone that had been in a wreck; and defendant concedes he was impaired based on the blood test. In regard to the injuries, defendant had a cut on his cheek consistent with blood on the steering wheel; there was blood between the driver\u2019s and passenger seat, as well as on the back of the passenger seat, consistent with defendant having to crawl out the passenger door due to the driver\u2019s side door being stuck closed. While this is merely a scenario that could have happened, it is sufficient, in consideration with the other evidence,\nfor a reasonable jury to infer that defendant was under the influence of an impairing substance when he drove the vehicle.\nThere are numerous possible other scenarios, .... But,\nto hold that the trial court must grant a motion to dismiss unless, in the opinion of the court, the evidence excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence would in effect constitute the presiding judge the trier of facts.. .. Proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is required before the jury can convict. . . . What the evidence proves or fails to prove is a question of fact for the jury.\nState v. Mack, 81 N.C. App. 578, 583, 345 S.E.2d 223, 226 (1986) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Consequently, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the State presented sufficient evidence to survive the motion to dismiss; and as a result, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of all evidence.\nB. Jury Instruction on Reasonable Doubt\nDefendant\u2019s next argument is that the trial court committed plain error by giving an erroneous instruction to the jury on reasonable doubt, which improperly lowered the State\u2019s burden of proof. We disagree.\nOur Court generally reviews jury instructions de novo. State v. Jenkins, 202 N.C. App. 291, 296, 688 S.E.2d 101, 105 disc. review denied, 364 N.C. 245, 698 S.E.2d 665 (2010). However, jury instructions which are not objected to are reviewed for plain error. State v. Mohamud, 199 N.C. App. 610, 612, 681 S.E.2d 541, 543 (2009). Plain error exists where the error is \u201c \u2018so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been done[.]\u2019 \u201d State v. Odom, 307 N.C. 655, 660, 300 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1983) (quoting United States v. McCaskill, 676 F.2d 995, 1002 (4th Cir. 1982)). \u201cUnder the plain error rule, defendant must convince this Court not only that there was error, but that absent the error, the jury probably would have reached a different result.\u201d State v. Jordan, 333 N.C. 431, 440, 426 S.E.2d 692, 697 (1993).\nIn the case at bar, the trial court initially gave pattern jury instruction, N.C.P.I., Crim. 101.10 (2011), regarding the State\u2019s burden of proof and reasonable doubt. Twenty-six minutes later the jury indicated that it was deadlocked and was set to reenter the courtroom when it decided to rediscuss. Nine minutes later the jury returned to the courtroom and the foreperson asked \u201cto be reminded of the definition of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and we wanted to also look at some of the photographic evidence that was submitted.\u201d The trial court asked if either side had an objection to a reinstruction, which they did not, and the trial court proceeded to again give the pattern jury instruction, adding \u201c[r]emember, nothing can be proved 100 percent basically, but beyond a reasonable doubt. So you have to decide for yourself what is reasonable, what makes sense.\u201d The jury returned to deliberations and six minutes later found defendant guilty on both charges.\nIn adding its own words to the pattern jury instruction, defendant contends the trial court diluted the State\u2019s burden of proof. Defendant notes that the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a well-established principle in our legal system. In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 363-64, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368, 375 (1970). The additional language allegedly undermined the principle by defining doubt in a way that allowed the jury to convict defendant without being fully satisfied or entirely convinced of his guilt. Furthermore, defendant argues the trial court failed to inform defense counsel of the proposed additional language, which was in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1234(c) (2011), and any \u201cfailure to comply with the statutory mandate is reversible error.\u201d In re Eades, 143 N.C. App. 712, 713, 547 S.E.2d 146, 147 (2001).\nOn the other hand, the State contends the instructions to the jury, as a whole,- were conceptually correct. \u201c \u2018[A]s a whole, the instructions [must] correctly conve [y] the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.\u2019 \u201d State v. Hooks, 353 N.C. 629, 633, 548 S.E.2d 501, 505 (2001) (quoting Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140, 99 L. Ed. 150, 167 (1954)). Moreover,\n\u201c \u2018[t]he charge of the court must be read as a whole ... , in the same connected way that the judge is supposed to have intended it and the jury to have considered it. . . .\u2019 It will be construed contextually, and isolated portions will not be held prejudicial when the charge as [a] whole is correct. If the charge presents the law fairly and clearly to the jury, the fact that some expressions, standing alone, might be considered erroneous will afford no grounds for reversal.\u201d\nId. at 634, 548 S.E.2d at 505 (quoting State v. Rich, 351 N.C. 386, 393-94, 527 S.E.2d 299, 303 (2000)).\nIf, when so construed, it is sufficiently clear that no reasonable cause exists to believe that the jury was misled or misinformed, any exception to it will not be sustained even though the instruction could have been more aptly worded.\nState v. Maniego, 163 N.C. App. 676, 685, 594 S.E.2d 242, 248 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The State notes the first two paragraphs of the instruction given to the jury were from the pattern jury instruction on reasonable doubt and the additional statement of \u201cnothing can be proved 100 percent basically, but beyond a reasonable doubt, so you have to decide for yourself what is reasonable, what makes sense[,]\u201d is more or less a correct statement of the law. Furthermore, defendant conveniently neglects to discuss the trial court\u2019s final sentences in which it stated, \u201cAny questions about the definition of reasonable doubt? The State has the burden and the defendant has no burden. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t have to testify.\u201d Evidently, the trial court attempted to rephrase the definition of reasonable doubt in a manner in which the jury could understand, but at the same time maintain that the entire burden was on the State and not defendant.\nOur Supreme Court has addressed this issue on a few occasions where the trial court, in explaining reasonable doubt, used the descriptions \u201c \u2018\u201cnot satisfied beyond any doubt, or all doubt; or a vain or fanciful doubt, but rather what the term implies, a reasonable doubt, one based on common sense and reason, generated by insufficiency and proof[,]\u201d \u2019 \u201d State v. Flippin, 280 N.C. 682, 687, 186 S.E.2d 917, 921 (1972) (quoting State v. Brackett, 218 N.C. 369, 372, 11 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1940)), and \u201c[t]his does not mean satisfied beyond all doubt. Neither does it mean satisfied beyond some shadow of a doubt or a vain, imaginary, or fanciful doubt.\u201d State v. Miller, 344 N.C. 658, 671, 477 S.E.2d 915, 923 (1996). Even more, one trial court described reasonable doubt as meaning \u201cjust that, a reasonable doubt. It is not a mere possible, fanciful or academic doubt, nor is it proof beyond a shadow of a doubt nor proof beyond all doubts, for there are few things in human existence that are beyond all doubts.\u201d State v. Adams, 335 N.C. 401, 420, 439 S.E.2d 760, 770 (1994). To be upheld, the instruction must not have \u201cindicate[d] that the burden of proof is less than \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d Miller, 344 N.C. at 671-72, 477 S.E.2d at 923. Based on the cases cited and the trial court\u2019s final statements, we cannot see how the additional language that \u201cnothing can be proved 100 percent basically,\u201d when viewed together with the correct pattern jury instruction, lowered the burden to less than reasonable doubt or otherwise prejudiced defendant.\nDefendant further argues the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury amounted to structural error.\nStructural error is a rare form of constitutional error resulting from \u201cstructural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism\u201d which are so serious that \u201c \u2018a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d \u201cSuch errors \u2018infect the entire trial process,\u2019 and \u2018necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair[.]\u2019 \u201d\n... In fact, the United States Supreme Court emphasizes a strong presumption against structural error[.]\nState v. Garcia, 358 N.C. 382, 409-10, 597 S.E.2d 724, 744 (2004) (citations omitted). However, as discussed above, we do not believe the trial court\u2019s additional language amounted to a structural error which infected defendant\u2019s entire trial process. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s jury instruction, when viewed as a whole, does not amount to structural or plain error. \u25a0\nC. Duty of Impartiality Owed to the Jury\nDefendant\u2019s third argument is similar to his second argument in that it relates to the trial court\u2019s added language to the jury instruc tion, but defendant is now arguing that the trial court violated its duty of impartiality by lowering the State\u2019s burden of proof while the jury was deadlocked. As noted above, we do not believe the trial court\u2019s additional language was a violation, and consequently we disagree with defendant\u2019s current argument.\nDefendant failed to raise its issue regarding the trial court\u2019s impartiality in the lower court; nonetheless, a question of whether the trial court violated its duty of impartiality is preserved as a matter of law notwithstanding defendant\u2019s failure to raise the issue. State v. Young, 324 N.C. 489, 494, 380 S.E.2d 94, 97 (1989). In determining whether the trial court violated its duty of impartiality we apply a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. State v. Davis, 353 N.C. 1, 41, 539 S.E.2d 243, 269 (2000). \u201cWhether the judge's language amounts to an expression of opinion is determined by its probable meaning to the jury, not by the judge\u2019s motive.\u201d State v. McEachern, 283 N.C 57, 59-60, 194 S.E.2d 787, 789 (1973). Additionally, the timing of the remarks must be considered. See State v. Jenkins, 115 N.C. App. 520, 525, 445 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1994).\nAt issue is whether the trial court abandoned its neutrality in regard to the question of defendant\u2019s guilt. Defendant contends the trial court improperly conveyed its opinion of the case to the jury through its additional language in the instruction, which effectively told the jury that convicting defendant would be proper even if the State had not proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is well settled that \u201c[j]urors respect the judge and are easily influenced by suggestions, whether intentional or otherwise, emanating from the bench.\u201d State v. Holden, 280 N.C. 426, 429, 185 S.E.2d 889, 892 (1972). \u201cThe slightest intimation from the trial judge as to the weight or credibility to be given evidentiary matters will always have great weight with the jury, . . .\u201d State v. Grogan, 40 N.C. App. 371, 374, 253 S.E.2d 20, 22 (1979). N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 15A-1222-32 (2011), bar the trial court from expressing any opinion in front of the jury regarding a question of fact. Thus, defendant claims the trial court\u2019s instruction indicates that guilty verdicts would be proper, in the case at hand, because the State could not be expected to fully establish or entirely convince the jury that defendant was guilty.\nHowever, the State argues the trial court properly instructed the jury on the standard of reasonable doubt and therefore did not violate its duty to remain impartial. \u201cA remark by the court is not grounds for a new trial if, when considered in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, it could not have prejudiced defendant\u2019s case. The burden rests on the defendant to show that the trial court\u2019s remarks were prejudicial.\u201d State v. Anderson, 350 N.C. 152, 179, 513 S.E.2d 296, 312 (1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Sometime prior to the trial court\u2019s questionable instruction it had informed the jury that\n[t]he law requires the presiding judge to be impartial and express no opinions as to the facts. You are not to draw any inference from any ruling that I have made. You must not let any inflection in my voice or expression on my face, or any question I\u2019ve asked a witness or anything else that I have done during this trial influence your findings. It is your duty to find the facts of the case from the evidence as presented.\nFurthermore, the colloquy between the trial court and defense counsel indicates that the jury may not have been deadlocked at the time of the trial court\u2019s additional language.\nThe Court: In the matter of State versus Robin Fove. there\u2019s some indication that the jury is deadlocked.\nMr. Corrigan: I thought the issue was that they messed up the verdict sheet?\nThe Court: Well, that\u2019s the earlier version.\nMr. Corrigan: We didn\u2019t hear the second version.\nThe Court: Bring them back in.\nBailiff: Now they\u2019re rediscussing it again.\nMr. Corrigan: I guess they are not hopelessly deadlocked, huh, Judge?\nThe Court: Deadlocked, but maybe not hopeless. What did they do with the verdict sheet they messed up?\nThe jury then discussed the case for nine minutes and returned, asking for the reinstruction on reasonable doubt and to view all the photographic evidence. Neither defense counsel, nor the trial court, appears to have known what the jury was thinking and consequently we cannot tell either. The State presented substantial evidence of the crimes and the trial court attempted to insulate itself from any views of impartiality by instructing the jury to not draw any inferences from its comments. Thus, the trial court did not err in giving its additional instruction on reasonable doubt because it did not violate its duty of impartiality.\nD. Coercion of the Jury\nDefendant\u2019s final argument again revolves around the trial court\u2019s added language to the pattern jury instruction on reasonable doubt. This time defendant contends the trial court coerced the jury into returning guilty verdicts by defining reasonable doubt in a way that facilitated findings of guilt on both charges. We again disagree.\nAs stated above, defendant failed to object to the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury; and as a result, we review defendant\u2019s argument for plain error. State v. Hunt, 192 N.C. App. 268, 270, 664 S.E.2d 662, 663 (2008). In reviewing the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must look at the totality of the circumstances. State v. Dexter, 151 N.C. App. 430, 433, 566 S.E.2d 493, 496 (2002). Moreover, we must look for any indications of a deadlock, State v. Adams, 85 N.C. App. 200, 210, 354 S.E.2d 338, 344 (1987), and determine whether the particular instruction altered the burden of proof. State v. Dial, 38 N.C. App. 529, 533, 248 S.E.2d 366, 368 (1978).\nDefendant argues the trial court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt improperly influenced the jury\u2019s deliberations and caused the jury to return guilty verdicts where it is likely that it would not have. It is well established that a trial court may not coerce a jury into returning a particular verdict. Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445, 446, 13 L. Ed. 2d 957, 958 (1965). There is no indication that the jury was definitely deadlocked or that the trial court\u2019s instruction improperly coerced the jury into returning guilty verdicts.\nAt the same time the jury asked for a reinstruction on reasonable doubt, it asked for all photographic evidence, which included pho-. tographs of the bloodstains within the vehicle, as well as pictures of defendant\u2019s various injuries. The photographs could have easily influenced the jury to return guilty verdicts. Furthermore, as previously discussed, the trial court\u2019s instruction did not unduly influence the jury to amount to plain error. The trial court even qualified its additional comments by finishing the instruction with the statements, \u201cAny questions about the definition of reasonable doubt? The State has the burden and the defendant has no burden. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t have to testify.\u201d Clearly, the trial court left for the jury to decide what was reasonable and the evidence does not prove it likely that the jury would have returned any other verdicts than those of guilty. Consequently, the trial court did not coerce the jury into returning guilty verdicts and its additional instruction on reasonable doubt did not amount to plain error.\nIII. Conclusion\nBased on the foregoing, we find no error on behalf of the trial court. The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as the evidence at trial was sufficient to submit the issue to the jury. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s additional instruction regarding reasonable doubt did not lower the State\u2019s burden of proof, violate the trial court\u2019s duty of impartiality, or unduly coerce the jury into returning verdicts of guilty.\nNo error.\nJudges McGEE and GEER concur.", "author": "McCullough, judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Jurisdiction \u2014 personal\u2014insufficient minimum contacts\u2014 defendant properly dismissed\nThe trial court did not commit reversible error in a negligence, breach of contract, fraud, fraud upon the public, and unfair and deceptive trade practices case when it dismissed defendant SCI from the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs failed to allege facts that permitted the inference of jurisdiction under the long-arm statute.\n2. Statutes of Limitation and Repose \u2014 continuing wrong doctrine \u2014 discovery rule \u2014 duty to support negligence claim not established\nThe trial court did not err by granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss claims of negligence, fraud, and breach of contract. As neither the continuing wrong doctrine nor the discovery rule were applicable to plaintiffs\u2019 claims, a majority of the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 argu merit that N.C.G.S. \u00a7 65-60 established the duty supporting both their common law negligence and negligence per se claims was rejected.\n3. Contracts \u2014 breach of contract \u2014 filed outside statute of limitations \u2014 improper basis \u2014 insufficient allegations\u2014 third-party beneficiary claims\nThe trial court did not err when it dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of contract. The claims were filed outside the statute of limitations, violation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 65-60 was not the proper basis for plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claims, and the allegations failed to provide even general terms of the contract which were necessary to determine whether a breach occurred. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of contract based on a theory of third-party beneficiary were properly dismissed for the same reasons.\n4. Fraud \u2014 upon the public \u2014 not recognized theory \u2014 properly dismissed\nThe trial court did not err by dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim of fraud upon the public for failure to state a claim. Fraud upon the public is not a recognized theory of recovery under North Carolina law.\n5. Fraud \u2014 common law \u2014 failure to allege claim with particularity \u2014 properly dismissed\nThe trial court did not err by dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim for common law fraud because plaintiffs failed to properly allege the fraud claim with particularity.\n6. Unfair Trade Practices \u2014 breach of contract not sufficient to establish claim \u2014 failure to allege aggravating circumstances\nThe trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices. A mere breach of contract, even if intentional, was not sufficiently unfair or deceptive to sustain an action under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 75-1.1 and plaintiffs failed to allege substantial aggravating circumstances.\nAppeal by Plaintiffs from order entered 29 July 2010 by Judge Timothy L.

Lathrop and Alton L. Gwaltney, III, for Defendant-Appellee.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "BEASLEY, Judge.\nPatricia Colyer Birtha, James West Lindsay, and Montez Nelson (Plaintiffs) appeal an order of dismissal of their claims of negligence, breach of contract, fraud, fraud upon the public, and unfair and deceptive trade practices against Stonemor, North Carolina, LLC, Stonemor, North Carolina Funeral Services, Inc., Stonemor North Carolina Subsidiary, LLC, Alderwoods Group, Inc., and Service Corporation International aka SCI doing business as York Memorial Cemetery (Defendants). For the following reasons, we affirm.\nPlaintiffs assert similar injuries stemming from Defendants\u2019 alleged failure to properly maintain grave sites. Plaintiff Birtha\u2019s mother was buried at York Cemetery in 1968 and in February 2007, after several inquiries, Birtha became aware that her mother\u2019s headstone was placed at the wrong burial plot. Plaintiff Lindsay\u2019s mother\u2019s and father\u2019s remains were interred at York Cemetery in August 1986. In February 2007, Lindsey discovered that Defendants removed his parents\u2019 headstones, and Defendants informed him that his parents\u2019 headstones and gravesites could not be located. Plaintiff Nelson\u2019s mother\u2019s remains were buried at York Cemetery in February 2003 and her father\u2019s remains were buried November of 2006. When Nelson\u2019s father\u2019s remains were buried, she was informed that Defendants could not locate her mother\u2019s grave site.\nPlaintiffs commenced this action on 18 June 2007, in their capacities as estate administrators, against Defendants. Defendant SCI moved to dismiss the original complaint pursuant to N.C.R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) (Rule 12(b)(2)) and Defendants Alderwoods Group, Inc. and SCI moved to dismiss pursuant to N.C.R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (Rule 12(b)(6)). At the 17 April 2009 hearing, Plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint. On 9 July 2010, the trial court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) and dismissed all claims against all Defendants. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial on 12 August 2010 and notice of appeal on 27 August 2010.\nIn their first argument, Plaintiffs assert that the trial court committed reversible error when it dismissed SCI from the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction. We disagree.\nOur Court has previously held that when reviewing the grant or denial of a Rule 12(b)(2) motion\n[t]he standard of review to be applied by a trial court . . . depends upon the procedural context confronting the court.\nIf the defendant supplements his motion to dismiss with an affidavit or other supporting evidence, the allegations in the complaint can no longer be taken as true or controlling and plaintiff cannot rest on the allegations of the complaint. In order to determine whether there is evidence to support an exercise of personal jurisdiction, the court then considers (1) any allegations in the complaint that are not controverted by the defendant\u2019s affidavit and (2) all facts in the affidavit (which are uncontroverted because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to offer evidence).\nWhen this Court reviews a decision as to personal jurisdiction, it considers only whether the findings of fact by the trial court are supported by competent evidence in the record; if so, this Court must affirm the order of the trial court. Under Rule 52(a)(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, however, the trial court is not required to make specific findings of fact unless requested by a party. When the record contains no findings of fact, it is presumed that the court on proper evidence found facts to support its judgment.\nBanc of Am. Secs. LLC v. Evergreen Int\u2019l Aviation, Inc., 169 N.C. App. 690, 693-94, 611 S.E.2d 179, 182-83 (2005) (internal citations, internal quotation marks, ellipses, and brackets omitted).\nIn order to determine whether our courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, we apply a two part test: \u201c(1) Does a statutory basis for personal jurisdiction exist, and (2) If so, does the exercise of this jurisdiction violate constitutional due process?\u201d Golds v. Central Express, Inc., 142 N.C. App. 664, 665, 544 S.E.2d 23, 25 (2001). \u201cThe assertion of personal jurisdiction over a defendant comports with due process if defendant is found to have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state to confer jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 665-66, 544 S.E.2d at 25. The long-arm statute is \u201cliberally construed to find personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to the full extent allowed by due process.\u201d Id. at 666, 544 S.E.2d at 26 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe burden is on [the] plaintiff to establish itself within some ground for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendant.\u201d Public Relations, Inc. v. Enterprises, Inc., 36 N.C. App. 673, 677, 245 S.E.2d 782, 784 (1978).\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs contend that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-75.4(1) confers jurisdiction because SCI acquired and retains all shares in Alderwoods, a co-defendant. Defendant SCI submitted an affidavit in support of its Rule 12(b)(2) motion. Plaintiffs did not present any affidavits, but instead relied on verified responses by Defendants. Defendants\u2019 responses merely re-state an issue that is uncontroverted; SCI acquired and retains all shares of Alderwoods. However, \u201cwhen a subsidiary of a foreign corporation is carrying on business in a particular jurisdiction, the parent is not automatically subject to jurisdiction in the state\u201d. Ash v Burnham, Corp, 80 N.C. App. 459, 462, 343 S.E.2d 2, 4 (1986) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Rather, the issue is whether or not SCI, by virtue of its position as sole shareholder in Alderwoods, falls within the purview of the long-arm statute.\nIn Golds, our Court found that the plaintiff did not meet its burden of presenting a, prima facie statutory basis for personal jurisdiction where \u201cthe complaint [did] not state the section of this statute under which jurisdiction [was] obtained nor [did] it allege any facts as to activity being conducted in this State].]\u201d Golds, 142 N.C. App. at 667, 544 S.E.2d at 26. Similarly, Plaintiffs assert the section of the long-arm statute in their brief, but failed to state any grounds for personal jurisdiction in their complaint. Further, the complaint did not allege facts as to activity being conducted within the state by SCI.\n[W]e stressed that while application of the minimum contacts standard will vary with the quality and nature of defendant\u2019s activity, ... it is essential in each case that there be some act by which defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protection of its laws. Absent such purposeful activity by defendant in the forum State, there can be no contact with the forum State sufficient to justify personal jurisdiction over defendant.\nBuying Group, Inc. v. Coleman, 296 N.C. 510, 515, 251 S.E.2d 610, 614 (1979) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nAn affidavit provided by Janet Key of SCI supports the trial court\u2019s decision in that SCI had no employees, it has corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas, SCI had no business dealings in North Carolina, nor does it maintain accounts in North Carolina, SCI does not own real property in North Carolina, nor pay taxes to the State of North Carolina. Based on the foregoing, we hold that Plaintiffs failed to allege facts that permitted the inference of jurisdiction under the long-arm statute. Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is overruled.\nNext, Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred by granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims of negligence, fraud, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs assert that they filed their claims within the required statute of limitations, and that North Carolina recognizes the continuing wrong doctrine as a tolling mechanism for negligence claims. We disagree.\nThis Court reviews the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to determine\nwhether the complaint states a claim for which relief can be granted under some legal theory when the complaint is liberally construed and all the allegations included therein are taken as true. On a motion to dismiss, the complaint\u2019s material factual allegations are taken as true. Dismissal is proper when one of the following three conditions is satisfied: (1) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff\u2019s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiffs claim. On appeal of a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, this Court conducts a de novo review of the pleadings to determine their legal sufficiency and to determine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to dismiss was correct.\nBurgin v. Owen, 181 N.C. App. 511, 512, 640 S.E.2d 427, 428-29 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nThe trial court dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim on two grounds, that it (1) was barred by the statute of limitations and (2) failed to state a claim for relief. (R. 48)\nTo successfully allege a negligence claim, plaintiffs must show \u201c(1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, (2) the defendant breached that duty, (3) the defendant\u2019s breach was an actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, and (4) the plaintiff suffered damages as the result of the defendant\u2019s breach.\u201d Gibson v. Ussery, 196 N.C. App. 140, 143, 675 S.E.2d 666, 668 (2009) (citation omitted). \u201cA statute of limitations defense may properly be asserted in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss if it appears on the face of the complaint that such a statute bars the claim. Once the defendant raises a statute of limitations defense, the burden of showing that the action was instituted within the prescribed period is on the plaintiff.\u201d Horton v. Carolina Medicorp, 344 N.C. 133, 136, 472 S.E.2d 778, 780 (1996) (citation omitted). Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat \u00a7 1-52 (2011), the statute of limitations for negligence is three years. \u201cA cause of action based on negligence accrues when the wrong giving rise to the right to bring suit is committed, even though the damages at that time be nominal and the injuries cannot be discovered until a later date.\u201d Harrold v. Dowd, 149 N.C. App. 777, 781, 561 S.E.2d 914, 918 (2002).\nPlaintiffs assert that the continuing wrong doctrine applies to the negligence claims and thereby tolls the statute of limitations until the violative act ceases. Our Supreme Court has recognized the continuing wrong doctrine as \u201can exception to the general rule that a claim accrues when the right to maintain a suit arises.\u201d Babb v. Graham, 190 N.C. App. 463, 481, 660 S.E.2d 626, 637 (2008). \u201cFor the continuing wrong doctrine to apply, the plaintiff must show a continuing violation by the defendant that is occasioned by continual unlawful acts, not by continual ill effects from an original violation.\u201d Marzec v. Nye, 203 N.C. App. 88, 94, 690 S.E.2d 537, 542 (2010) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201cCourts view continuing violations as falling into two narrow categories. One category arises when there has been a long-standing policy of discrimination. ... In the second continuing violation category, there is a continually recurring violation.\u201d Faulkenbury v. Teachers\u2019 & State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, 108 N.C. App. 357, 368, 424 S.E.2d 420, 425 (1993). The first category is not applicable in this case because Plaintiffs do not allege discrimination. As for the second category, our courts have used this exception narrowly. We could find no case law, and Plaintiffs have presented no case law to suggest that the allegations here would amount to a continually recurring violation as opposed to the continual ill effects from an original violation.\nWe also reject Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the discovery rule tolls the statute of limitations in this case. \u201cN.C.G.S. \u00a7 1-52(16) establishes what is commonly referred to as the discovery rule, which tolls the running of the statute of limitations for torts resulting in certain latent injuries.\u201d Misenheimer v. Burris, 360 N.C. 620, 622, 637 S.E.2d 173, 175 (2006). The discovery rule provides,\n[u]nless otherwise provided by statute, for personal injury or physical damage to claimant\u2019s property, the cause of action, except in causes of actions referred to in G.S. l-15(c), shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant or physical damage to his property becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant, whichever event first occurs. Provided that no cause of action shall accrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action.\nN.C. Gen. Stat \u00a7 1-52(16) (2011) (emphasis added). In this case, Plaintiffs do not allege bodily harm or physical damage to Plaintiffs\u2019 property; therefore, the discovery rule is not applicable. Accordingly, the trial court properly determined that the doctrine of continuing wrong was inapplicable and all but one of Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims was properly dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations. Because Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the statute of limitations, with the exception of James Grier\u2019s (Mr. Grier) claim which Defendants concede is not barred by the statute of limitations, we now address Grier\u2019s remaining negligence claim.\nAll Plaintiffs, including Mr. Grier, rely on N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 65-60 to establish a duty of care owed by Defendants. The statute states,\n[a] record shall be kept of every burial in the cemetery of a cemetery company, showing the date of burial, name of the person buried, together with lot, plot, and space in which such burial was made therein... and shall be readily available at all reasonable times for examination by an authorized representative of the [North Carolina Cemetery] Commission.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 65-60 (2011). Plaintiffs contend that Section 65-60 establishes both the duty supporting their common law negligence claims and also their negligence per se claims. In order to prevail on a claim of negligence per se, plaintiff must show,\n(1) a duty created by a statute or ordinance; (2) that the statute or ordinance was enacted to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff; (3) a breach of the statutory duty; (4) that the injury sustained was suffered by an interest which the statute protected; (5) that the injury was of the nature con templated in the statute; and, (6) that the violation of the statute proximately caused the injury.\nRudd v. Electrolux Corp., 982 F. Supp. 355, 365 (1997) (citing Baldwin v. GTE South, Inc., 335 N.C. 544, 439 S.E.2d 108 (1994)).\nA plain reading of the Section 65-60 shows that the statute was designed to ensure that cemeteries keep proper records and to give the North Carolina Cemetery Commission authority to enforce the record keeping requirement. Plaintiffs argue that Section 65-60 is designed to protect them, but they fail to argue, and we fail to see, how Plaintiffs are included in the class that the statute was designed to protect. Moreover, Plaintiffs also fail to allege that Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries were suffered by an interest which the statute protected, and that the injuries were of the nature contemplated in the statute. Based on the foregoing, the trial court properly dismissed all of the negligence claims, including Mr. Grier\u2019s claim.\nNext, Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred when it dismissed their claims for breach of contract. We disagree.\nPlaintiffs argue that they properly alleged a breach of the burial contract entered into by decedents. Plaintiffs advance breach of contract arguments on two bases: (i) failing to inter decedents in the agreed upon sites and (ii) failing to maintain records.\nPursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-52 (2011), the applicable statute of limitations for a breach of contract claim is three years. This action was not commenced until 2007. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to specifically allege the dates of the breach of each respective contract. The complaint does give the following dates of interment:\n7. The deceased, Sarah Lenon Colyer, mother of Plaintiff, Patricia Colyer Birtha, was interred at Defendant cemetery on or about July 28, 1968.\n8. The deceased, Lottie Mae Lindsay, mother of Plaintiff, James West Lindsay was interred at Defendant cemetery immediately after becoming deceased on or about August 16, 1968.9. The deceased, William Lindsay, father of Plaintiff, James West Lindsay, was interred at Defendant cemetery immediately after becoming deceased on or about August 20, 1986.\n10. The deceased, Rebecca Grier, mother of Plaintiff, Montez Nelson, was interred at Defendant cemetery immediately after becoming deceased on or about February 19, 2003.\n11. The deceased, James Grier, father of Plaintiff, Montez Nelson, was interred at Defendant cemetery immediately after becoming deceased on or about November 8, 2006.\nPlaintiffs further allege that\nDefendants have failed to maintain proper burial records from at least on or about July 28, 1968, to the present time, thereby causing the Plaintiffs^] decedents and numerous decedents of all other persons similarly situated as the Plaintiffs[\u2019] decedents to be buried at the wrong burial sites and causing grave markers to be placed at the wrong burial sites. Additionally, from at least July 28, 1968 to the present time, these Defendants have sold the same burial plot contracted for by one party to other parties ... thereby causing the same burial plot to be sold to multiple persons, in violation of the laws of the State of North Carolina, as well as the terms of each parties respective contract, (emphasis added).\nHere, the complaint generally alleges that the breach of contract occurred on the dates of interment, respectively. These dates are well outside of the three year statute of limitations for breach of contract claims. Even if we assume that the date of interment for each decedent controls as the date of breach of contract, as Defendants acknowledge, the statute of limitations would have expired as to all claims, except Mr. Grier. Because the trial court found that the breach of contract claim was barred by the statute of limitations, and Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is unsupported by authority, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the breach of contract claim, except as to Mr. Grier, is barred by the statute of limitations.\nAdditionally, the trial court also properly dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claims for failure to state a claim. It is well-settled that a \u201cviolation of a statute designed to protect persons or property is a negligent act, and if such negligence proximately causes injury, the violator is liable. This is an appropriate allegation on the first cause of action based on negligence and not on the second based on breach of contract.\u201d Murray v. Aircraft Corporation, 259 N.C. 638, 642, 131 S.E.2d 367, 370 (1963) (internal citations omitted). Here, Plaintiffs allege that violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 65-60 is the basis for their breach of contract claims. Because a violation of the statute is not the proper basis for a breach of contract claim, all Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claims for failure to maintain records, including Mr. Grier, were properly dismissed.\nFinally, the breach of contract claims were properly dismissed because the allegations failed to provide even general terms of the contract which were necessary to determine whether a breach occurred. See Claggett v. Wake Forest University, 126 N.C. App. 602, 608, 486 S.E.2d 443, 446 (1997) (\u201cTo state a claim for breach of contract, the complaint must allege that a valid contract existed between the parties, that defendant breached the terms thereof, the facts constituting the breach, and that damages resulted from such breach.\u201d) Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claims.\nPlaintiffs also contend that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim for breach of contract based on third-party beneficiary. For the same reasons stated above, we overrule Plaintiffs\u2019 third party beneficiary claim.\nNext, Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred by dismissing their claim of fraud upon the public for failure to state a claim. We disagree. As the trial court stated, fraud upon the public is not a recognized theory of recovery under North Carolina law. See Gilmore v. Smathers, 167 N.C. 440, 83 S.E. 823 (1914). Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is meritless.\nPlaintiffs also argue that the trial court committed reversible error when it determined that Plaintiffs did not allege a valid claim for relief for common law fraud. We disagree.\nPlaintiffs argue that they pled common law fraud with particularity in their complaint and that their claim for fraud was not time-barred by the statute of limitations because accrual of time starts at the time of discovery of the fraudulent conduct by the aggrieved party.\nTo allege a claim for fraud, a plaintiff must plead: \u201c(1) [a] [f]alse representation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage to the injured party.\u201d Isbey v. Cooper Companies, Inc., 103 N.C. App. 774, 776, 407 S.E.2d 254, 256 (1991). \u201cIn all averments of fraud . . . the circumstances constituting fraud... shall be stated with particularity.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 9(b) (2011). Our Supreme Court has held that the particularity requirement is satisfied \u201cby alleging time, place and content of the fraudulent representation, identity of the person making the representation and what was obtained as a result of the fraudulent acts or representations.\u201d Terry v. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 85, 273 S.E.2d 674, 678 (1981). Our Supreme Court has construed N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-52(9) \u201cto set accrual at the time of discovery regardless of the length of time between the fraudulent act or mistake and plaintiffs discovery of it.\u201d Feibus & Co. v. Godley Construction Co. 301 N.C. 294, 304, 271 S.E.2d 385, 392 (1980). \u201cUnder this provision, \u2018discovery\u2019 means either actual discovery or when the fraud should have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Darsie, 161 N.C. App. 542, 547, 589 S.E.2d 391, 396 (2003) (citation omitted).\nIn the case sub judice, Plaintiffs made the following allegations in their amended complaint:\n44. That the acts of the Defendants in providing incorrect [] burial maps to the plaintiffs . . . have been and continue to be intentional, willful and with malice aforethought to cause the Plaintiffs to rely to their detriment.\n45. The Plaintiffs . . . have been damaged based upon these false representations because the Defendants have buried the decedents of Plaintiffs ... in plots other than the burial sites which were purchased by the decedents of Plaintiffs[.]\n49. That these Defendants made these false statements and misrepresentations with the intent to cause all persons who purchased the burial plots to enter into said contract. . . from the Defendants based upon the false statements and material misrepresentations.\n50. That the persons who purchased said burial plots from Defendants and all other similarly situated person did in fact rely upon the false statements and material misrepresentations of the Defendants.\nThese allegations are very general and are not alleged with the required particularity where Plaintiffs failed to state (1) the time, place, or content of the misrepresentations; (2) the particular person making the misrepresentation; and (3) whether Plaintiffs relied on these misrepresentations. Plaintiffs failed to properly allege the fraud claim with particularity, and this assignment is overruled.\nPlaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices where Defendants (1) failed to place stakes at gravesites to establish proper boundaries, (2) failed to keep proper records to determine where decedents were buried, (3) lost headstones from graves, (4) could not establish where dece dents were buried, and (5) \u201chave engaged in conduct . . . forbidden under [N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1].\u201d\n\u201cTo state a claim for unfair and/or deceptive trade practices, the plaintiffs must allege that (1) the defendants committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice, or an unfair method of competition, (2) in or affecting commerce, (3) which proximately caused actual injury to the plaintiffs or to the plaintiffs\u2019 business.\u201d Walker v. Sloan, 137 N.C. App. 387, 395 529 S.E.2d 236, 243 (2000) (citation omitted). [I]t is well recognized that actions for unfair or deceptive trade practices are distinct from actions for breach of contract, and that a mere breach of contract, even if intentional, is not sufficiently unfair or deceptive to sustain an action under [N.C. Gen. Stat.] \u00a7 75-1.1.\u201d Eastover Ridge, L.L.C. v. Metric Constructors, Inc., 139 N.C. App. 360, 367-68, 533 S.E.2d 827, 832-33 (2000). \u201cNorth Carolina courts are extremely hesitant to allow plaintiffs to attempt to manufacture a tort action and alleged UDTP out of facts that are properly alleged as breach of contract claim.\u201d Jones v. Harrelson & Smith Contr\u2019rs, LLC, 194 N.C. App. 203, 229, 670 S.E.2d 242, 259 (2008) (citation omitted).\nHere, Plaintiffs failed to establish the existence of contracts between the Plaintiffs and Defendants and, have thus failed to show a breach of contract. Even assuming arguendo that Defendants breached these contracts, \u201ca mere breach of contract, even if intentional, is not sufficiently unfair or deceptive to sustain an action under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 75-1.1.\u201d Watson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., 160 N.C. App. 647, 657, 587 S.E.2d 87, 95 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[P]laintiff[s] must show substantial aggravating circumstances attending the breach to recover under the Act.\u201d Id. As Plaintiffs do not allege substantial aggravating circumstances, the trial, court properly dismissed Plaintiffs unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the claims of negligence breach of contract, fraud, fraud upon the public, and unfair and deceptive trade practices.\n' Affirmed.\nJudges BRYANT and GEER concur.", "author": "BEASLEY, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["PATRICIA COLYER BIRTHA, as administratrix of the Estate of SARAH LENON COLYER; deceased, JAMES WEST LINDSAY, as administrator of the Estate of LOTTIE MAE LINDSAY and WILLIAM LINDSAY, deceased, MONTEZZ NELSON, next of kin of REBECCA GRIER and JAMES GRIER, deceased on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated, Plaintiffs v.

Parish for defendant-appellant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STEELMAN, Judge.\nThe State presented sufficient evidence to survive a motion to dismiss on one count of statutory sex offense. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of other sexual conduct by defendant with another girl of similar age as the victim during the same time period, pursuant to N.C.R. Evid. 404(b). The trial court did not commit plain error in failing to intervene ex mero mo tu to exclude testimony concerning defendant\u2019s conduct with another girl.\nI. Factual and Procedural History\nA grand jury indicted defendant for one count of first-degree rape of a child, one count of first-degree sex offense of a child, two counts of statutory sex offense, and seven counts of statutory rape.\nThe victim named in the indictments (B.F.) testified at trial. Two other girls, C.J. and E.S., also testified concerning defendant\u2019s sexual conduct with them. Defendant was found guilty of first-degree rape, first-degree sexual offense, two counts of statutory sex offense, and six counts of statutory rape. Defendant was found not guilty of one count of statutory rape. The trial court consolidated the convictions into two judgments and imposed two consecutive sentences of 192 to 240 months imprisonment, from the presumptive range.\nDefendant appeals.\nII. Sufficiency of the Evidence\nIn his first argument, defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss one count of statutory sex offense for insufficient evidence. We disagree.\nWe review the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss de novo. State v. Smith, 186 N.C. App. 57, 62, 650 S.E.2d 29, 33 (2007). The trial court must determine whether there is substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense charged and that the defendant is the perpetrator of the offense. Id. \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d State v. Bates, 313 N.C. 580, 581, 330 S.E.2d 200, 201 (1985).\n\u201cIn considering a motion to dismiss, the trial court must analyze the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and give the State the benefit of every reasonable inference from the evidence.\u201d State v. Robinson, 355 N.C. 320, 336, 561 S.E.2d 245, 256 (2002).\nDefendant argues that there was no evidence that a sex offense occurred within the timeframe alleged at the Rosemont Avenue address. Defendant contends that as to this offense, B.F. testified that they had sexual intercourse, but did not specifically testify as to an act that would constitute a sex offense. However, B.F. testified that preceding each incident of sexual intercourse, defendant digitally penetrated her. This testimony was broad enough to encompass the incident that is the subject of defendant\u2019s argument. Taken in the light most favorable to the State, sufficient evidence was presented that defendant committed a sex offense upon B.F. at the Rosemont Avenue address.\nThis argument is without merit.\nIII. Evidence of Uncharged Sexual Conduct\nIn his second argument, defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of another young girl, E.S., pursuant to N.C.R. Evid. 404(b). We disagree.\nA. N.C.R. Evid. 404(4)1\n\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or,acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d N.C.R. Evid. 404(b) (2011). \u201cIt may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake, entrapment or accident.\u201d Id. Cases decided under N.C.R. Evid. 404(b) state a general rule of inclusion of relevant evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts by a defendant, \u201csubject to but one exception requiring its exclusion if its only probative value is to show that the defendant has the propensity or disposition to commit an offense of the nature of the crime charged.\u201d State v. Coffey, 326 N.C. 268, 278-79, 389 S.E.2d 48, 54 (1990) (emphasis in original).\nRelevant evidence is evidence \u201chaving any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.C.R. Evid. 401 (2011). \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s appellate courts have been \u2018markedly liberal in admitting evidence of similar sex offenses to show one of the purposes enumerated in Rule 404(b).\u2019 \u201d State v. Thaggard, 168 N.C. App. 263, 270, 608 S.E.2d 774, 780 (2005) (quoting State v. Scott, 318 N.C. 237, 247, 347 S.E.2d 414, 419 (1986)).\n\u201cThe admissibility of 404(b) evidence is subject to the weighing of probative value versus unfair prejudice mandated by Rule 403.\u201d Thaggard, 168 N.C. App. at 269, 608 S.E.2d at 779 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nB. N.C.R. Evid. 403\nWhen the features of the earlier act are dissimilar from those of the offense with which the defendant is currently charged, such evidence lacks probative value. Similarly, [w]hen otherwise similar offenses are distanced by significant stretches of time, commonalities become less striking, and the probative value of the analogy attaches less to the acts than to the character of the actor.\nState v. Badgett, 361 N.C. 234, 243, 644 S.E.2d 206, 212 (2007) (alteration in original) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\nN.C.R. Evid. 403 provides that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. N.C.R. Evid. 403 (2011). \u201cEvidence which is probative of the State\u2019s case necessarily will have a prejudicial effect upon the defendant; the question is one of degree.\u201d Coffey, 326 N.C. at 281, 389 S.E.2d at 56. Unfair prejudice is \u201can undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis[.]\u201d State v. Summers, 177 N.C. App. 691, 697, 629 S.E.2d 902, 907 (2006) (alteration in original).\nC. Standard of Review\nThis Court has previously stated that a ruling based on N.C.R. Evid. 404(b) is reviewed simply for abuse of discretion. Summers, 177 N.C. App. at 697, 629 S.E.2d at 907 (\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s determination to admit evidence under N.C. R. Evid. 404(b) and 403, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d). A closer examination of the Rule and its application leads us to conclude that while abuse of discretion is an integral part of a N.C.R. Evid. 404(b) analysis, the determination of whether evidence was properly admitted under N.C.R. Evid. 404(b) and 403 actually involves a three-step test.\nFirst, is the evidence relevant for some purpose other than to show that defendant has the propensity to commit the type of offense for which he is being tried? Coffey, 326 N.C. at 278, 389 S.E.2d at 54. Second, is that purpose relevant to an issue material to the pending case? State v. Anderson, 350 N.C. 152, 174, 513 S.E.2d 296, 310 (1999). Third, is the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice pursuant to N.C.R. Evid. 403? Summers, 177 N.C. App. at 697, 629 S.E.2d at 907.\nThe first two steps involve questions of relevance as defined by N.C.R. Evid. 401. Coffey, 326 N.C. at 278, 389 S.E.2d at 54. In State v. Wallace, 104 N.C. App. 498, 410 S.E.2d 226 (1991), this Court held that \u201ceven though a trial court\u2019s rulings on relevancy technically are not discretionary and therefore are not reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard . . . such rulings are given great deference on appeal.\u201d Wallace, 104 N.C. App. at 502, 410 S.E.2d at 228. Our Supreme Court recently adopted the language set forth in Wallace, stating that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s rulings on relevancy are technically not discretionary, though we accord them great deference on appeal.\u201d State v. Lane,_N.C._,__, 707 S.E.2d 210, 223 (2011).\nThis Court has consistently acknowledged the deferential standard since Wallace, but there have been instances where this Court has applied a type of de novo review. See, e.g., State v. Edmonds,_ N.C. App. _, _, 713 S.E.2d 111, 117 (2011) (\u201cThough review of relevancy determinations is de novo, [a] trial court\u2019s ruling on an evidentiary point will be presumed to be correct unless the complaining party can demonstrate that the particular ruling was in fact incorrect.\u201d (alteration in original) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)); State v. Capers,_N.C. App._,_, 704 S.E.2d 39, 45 (2010) (\u201cAlthough we review a trial court\u2019s ruling on the relevance of evidence de novo, we give a trial court\u2019s relevancy rulings great deference on appeal.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), appeal dismissed and disc. review denied,_N.C._, 707 S.E.2d 236 (2011).\nWhile we are-bound by Wallace, and now Lane, to give deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling, we hold that questions of relevance are, in fact, reviewed de novo. This Court reviews the trial court\u2019s determination anew, but accords deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling.\nThe third step of the N.C.R. Evid. 404(b) analysis consists of the N.C.R. Evid. 403 balancing test. This test is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Summers, 177 N.C. App. at 697, 629 S.E.2d at 907.\nD. Analysis\nIn the first step of our analysis, we review whether the evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct with E.S. was relevant for some purpose other than to show that defendant had the propensity for the type of conduct for which he was being tried. The trial court concluded that the evidence was relevant and admissible for the purpose of showing plan and intent.\nPrior to ruling that the evidence was admissible, the trial court heard testimony on voir dire from E.S. During that hearing, E.S. testified that defendant engaged in sexual conduct with her when she was 13 or 14 years old. E.S. was 20 years old at the time of the hearing, and B.F. was 21 at the time of the trial. The indictments allege that defendant engaged in sexual activity with B.F. over a period of years when she was 13 to 15 years old. Defendant\u2019s conduct with E.S. took place within the same time period as the offenses alleged in the indictments, and with a young girl of similar age.\nE.S.\u2019s testimony as to her sexual encounter with defendant tends to make the existence of a plan or intent to engage in sexual activity with young girls more probable. We hold that the trial court correctly determined that the evidence of'defendant\u2019s sexual conduct with E.S. was admissible for the purpose of showing defendant\u2019s plan or intent to engage in sexual activity with young girls.\nIn the second step of our analysis, we review whether the purpose is relevant to an issue material to the pending case. The trial court made no explicit conclusions regarding the relevance of defendant\u2019s plan to a specific issue in the case. However, the decision to admit the evidence implies that the trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s plan or intent was relevant to a material issue.\nIn this case, defendant was charged with nine counts of statutory rape or sex offense. The crucial element in each of these offenses was the age of the victim and the age of the defendant. E.S.\u2019s testimony was relevant on this issue, showing defendant\u2019s plan. This is consistent with analysis in prior cases.\nIn State v. Williams, 303 N.C. 507, 513, 279 S.E.2d 592, 596 (1981), where the defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree sex offense, evidence that a third young girl more than three years older than the victims was properly admitted to show intent and plan or design. In State v. McKinney, 110 N.C. App. 365, 372-73, 430 S.E.2d 300, 304 (1993), where the defendant was charged with first-degree rape of a child, evidence that the defendant molested young girls over a period of years was properly admitted to show a common plan to molest young girls. In Thaggard, 168 N.C. App. at 270-71, 608 S.E.2d at 780, evidence of similar sexual assaults on other girls of similar age within the past two years was properly admitted to show a common scheme.\nWe hold that the purpose of showing defendant\u2019s plan or intent is relevant to show defendant\u2019s plan to engage in sexual activity with young girls.\nIn the third step of our analysis, we review for abuse of discretion the trial court\u2019s determination that the probative value of E.S.\u2019s testimony is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice pursuant to N.C.R. Evid. 403. The trial court concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, based on the temporal proximity of the events and the similarity in the age of the girls.\nDefendant cites State v. Beckelheimer, _N.C. App. _, 712 S.E.2d 216 (2011), in support of his argument that E.S.\u2019s testimony was not sufficiently similar for the purpose of showing defendant\u2019s plan. In Beckelheimer, the Court held that evidence of defendant\u2019s prior conduct was irrelevant to show a general plan. In that case, the witness was three or four years younger than the defendant; in contrast, the victim was 16 years younger than the defendant. Beckelheimer,_N.C. App. at_, 712 S.E.2d at 219-20.\nIn the instant case, the prior bad act took place within the same time period alleged in the indictments. The timing does not support the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the similarity of the acts, E.S. was \u201cthe same or within one year of the same\u201d age as B.F., the victim. Defendant was an adult at the time of all alleged acts with B.F. and with E.S.\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the proffered evidence was admissible under N.C.R. Evid. 403. We hold that E.S.\u2019s testimony regarding a prior sexual encounter with defendant was properly admitted under N.C.R. Evid. 404(b) for the purpose of showing defendant\u2019s plan, and we further hold that the admission of this evidence was not unduly prejudicial.\nThis argument is without merit.\nIII. Failure to Intervene Ex Mero Motu\nIn his third argument, defendant contends that the trial court committed plain error in failing to intervene ex mero motu to exclude evidence. We disagree.\nA. Standard of Review\nBy failing to object to the evidence at trial, defendant has not preserved the issue for appeal. We review this issue for plain error. State v. Rourke, 143 N.C.

Analysis\n\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d N.C.R. Evid. 404(b).\nDefendant argues that testimony from another young woman (C.J.) was \u201chighly prejudicial negative character evidence.\u201d The evi dence consisted of one line of testimony that \u201cCammy\u201d was a \u201cgirl that Tony [defendant] had \u2014 Tony got pregnant, but she moved.\u201d Cammy was mentioned in a letter that defendant gave C.J. to give to B.F. Defendant argues that this evidence was introduced solely for the purpose of showing defendant\u2019s propensity to have sex with underage girls.\nThe only evidence of Cammy\u2019s age was that she was older than C.J. There was no evidence that Cammy was underage. The State asked C.J. about Cammy while laying a foundation for the introduction of the letter from defendant. Defendant requested C.J. to give to B.F. this letter, in which defendant writes to B.F. \u201c[y]ou thought I was cheating on you, but really it was you who cheated on me[.]\u201d\nAssuming arguendo that the admission of this testimony was error, the State presented substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt through the uncontested testimony of B.F. Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the jury probably would have reached a different result had the evidence not been admitted. Defendant also fails to demonstrate that admission of the evidence resulted in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. The admission of this evidence does not rise to the level of plain error.\nNO ERROR.\nJudges CALABRIA and BEASLEY concur.", "author": "STEELMAN, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

On appeal, Plaintiff argues that the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant on the grounds that the record disclosed the existence of genuine issues of material fact concerning the extent to which Defendant allegedly violated Chapter 57C of the North Carolina General Statutes (\u201cthe LLC Act\u201d), was unjustly enriched and engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices, and acted inconsistently with North Carolina public policy. After careful consideration of Plaintiffs challenges to the trial court\u2019s order in light of the record and the applicable law, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order should be affirmed.\nI. Factual Background A. Substantive Facts\nOn 1 February 2007, Plaintiff leased a tract of commercial property in Raleigh from Downtown Properties, LLC. At that time, Downtown Properties was a limited liability company that had a single member, the Paul W. Woo Revocable Trust. Although Defendant, who was the widow of Paul Woo, managed Downtown Properties, she did not own it and was not a member of the LLC. The lease between Plaintiff and Downtown Properties provided that Plaintiff was \u201csolely responsible for obtaining any liquor license for the sale of alcoholic beverages at the Premises, and [that] this lease IS expressly conditioned on the issuance or revocation of such permit.\u201d\nBetween 1 February 2007, the effective date of the lease, and 1 May 2007, Plaintiff paid Downtown Properties the required $40,000 security deposit and $120,000 in rent. However, since Plaintiff was unable to obtain a permit authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages, the parties terminated the lease on 4 May 2007. On 18 September 2007, Downtown Properties sold its real estate, including this property, to a third party. After selling the property, Downtown Properties had no assets. As a result, Downtown Properties filed Articles of Dissolution in 2009. Although Plaintiff filed suit against Downtown 'Properties on 12 August 2008 for the purpose of seeking reimbursement of the monies that it had paid under the lease and although Plaintiff obtained a default judgment against Downtown Properties on 2 October 2008, Plaintiff was unable to collect the amount of that judgment because Downtown Properties had no assets.\nB. Procedural History\nOn 24 April 2009, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging claims sounding in unjust enrichment and unfair or deceptive trade practices and seeking to pierce Downtown Properties\u2019 corporate veil for the purpose of obtaining an individual recovery from Defendant relating to actions that she had taken as the manager of Downtown Properties. Plaintiff\u2019s claim against Defendant rested upon the contention that Defendant had wrongfully assented to or participated in the sale and distribution of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets and that her participation in these events rendered her individually liable to Plaintiff.\nOn 24 June 2009, Defendant filed an answer denying the material allegations of Plaintiff\u2019s complaint and raising various affirmative defenses. In her answer, Defendant noted that the lease between Plaintiff and Downtown Properties, which Plaintiff attached to its complaint as an exhibit, stated that Defendant was the manager of Downtown Properties and asserted that, in \u201cher capacity as manager[,] she d[id] not have liability for the obligations\u201d of Downtown Properties. In addition, Defendant moved to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s complaint for various reasons.\nOn 7 January 2011, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. In support of her summary judgment motion, Defendant filed an affidavit which stated, in pertinent part, that:\n1. The Articles of Organization of Downtown Properties, LLC . . . were filed on April 26, 2000. . . . Beginning in 2005 the sole member of Downtown Properties was the Paul W. Woo Revocable Trust dated June 5, 2002.\n3. ... I became a Manager of Downtown Properties in 2005.1 ceased owning any interest as a Member in Downtown Properties in 2005 which is 2 years before the lease transaction with Rev 0, Inc.\n4. Downtown Properties, LLC, and Rev 0, Inc., entered into a document entitled \u201cLease\u201d with an effective date of February 1, 2007. . . .\n5. Subsequent to entering into the Lease between the parties, upon the request of Rev 0, Inc., the Lease Agreement was terminated by both parties effective May 4, 2007. . . .\n6. Subsequent to entering into a lease termination, Downtown Properties sold the Cabarrus Street property and all remaining land holdings on September 19, 2007. . . .\n7. Since the transfer in September of 2007, Downtown Properties has not acquired or conveyed any other assets of monetary value.\n8. After the conveyance of the assets in 2007, Downtown Properties consisted of no other assets of monetary value and, therefore, in 2009, it filed Articles of Dissolution.\n9. From 2007 forward, no assets of Downtown Properties have been distributed from Downtown Properties ... to Marilyn E. Woo.\n10. I have not been enriched or received anything of monetary value from Downtown Properties from 2007 to the date of this Affidavit.\n11. As the manager of Downtown Properties, LLC, I could not completely control or dominate the company since it was solely owned by the Paul W. Woo Revocable Trust under Trust Agreement dated June 5, 2002. The Member could at any time remove me as Manager of the company.\n12. As Manager of Downtown Properties, I implemented the policies and directions provided by the Member.\nOn 18 May 2011, the trial court granted Defendant\u2019s motion. Plaintiff noted an appeal to this Court from the trial court\u2019s order.\nII. Legal Analysis A. Standard of Review\nAccording to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c), summary judgment is properly granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cA party moving for summary judgment may prevail if it meets the burden (1) of proving an essential element of the opposing party\u2019s claim is nonexistent, or (2) of showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his or her claim.\u201d Lowe v. Bradford, 305 N.C. 366, 369, 289 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1982) (citations omitted). \u201cThe party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002) (citing DeWitt v. Eveready Battery Co., 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002)). \u201c[0]nce the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least establish a prima facie case at trial.\u201d Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784-85, 534 S.E.2d 660, 664, disc. review denied, 353 N.C. 262, 546 S.E.2d 400 (2000), cert. denied, 353 N.C. 371, 547 S.E.2d 810, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 950, 122 S. Ct. 345, 151 L. Ed. 2d 261 (2001). \u201c \u2018A genuine issue of material fact arises when \u2018the facts alleged . . . are of such nature as to affect the result of the action.\u2019 \u201d N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sadler, 365 N.C. 179, 182, 711 S.E.2d 114, 116 (2011) (quoting Kessing v. Mortgage Corp., 278 N.C. 523, 534, 180 S.E.2d 823, 830 (1971)) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also City of Thomasville v. Lease-Afex, Inc., 300 N.C. 651, 654, 268 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1980) (stating that \u201c[a]n issue is material if, as alleged, facts would constitute a legal defense, or would affect the result of the action or if its resolution would prevent the party against whom it is resolved from prevailing in the action\u201d) (internal citation omitted).\nB. Elements of Plaintiff\u2019s Claims\n1. Unjust Enrichment\nIn its complaint, Plaintiff asserted a claim against Defendant for unjust enrichment. Unjust enrichment has been defined as \u201ca legal term characterizing the \u2018result or effect of a failure to make restitution of, or for, property or benefits received under such circumstances as to give rise to a legal or equitable obligation to account therefor.\u2019 \u201d Carcano v. JBSS, LLC, 200 N.C. App. 162, 179, 684 S.E.2d 41, 54 (2009) (quoting Ivey v. Williams, 74 N.C. App. 532, 534, 328 S.E.2d 837, 838-39 (1985)) (internal citation omitted). \u201cA claim of this type is ... described as a claim in quasi contract or a contract implied in law. ... If there is a contract between the parties],] the contract governs the claim and the law will not imply a contract.\u201d Booe v. Shadrick, 322 N.C. 567, 570, 369 S.E.2d 554, 556 (1988) (citing Concrete Co. v. Lumber Co., 256 N.C. 709, 713-14, 124 S.E. 2d 905, 908 (1962), and Johnson v. Sanders, 260 N.C. 291, 295, 132 S.E. 2d 582, 586 (1963) (other citations omitted).\n2. Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices\nIn addition, Plaintiff asserted a claim against Defendant for unfair and deceptive trade practices. \u201cThe elements of a claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 . . . are: (1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of competition; (2) in or affecting commerce; (3) that proximately causes actual injury to the plaintiff or to his business.\u201d RD&J Props. v. Lauralea-Dilton Enters., LLC, 165 N.C. App. 737, 748, 600 S.E.2d 492, 500 (2004) (citing Furr v. Fonville Morisey Realty, Inc., 130 N.C. App. 541, 551, 503 S.E.2d 401, 408 (1998), disc. review improvidently allowed, 351 N.C. 41, 519 S.E.2d 314 (1999)). \u201cAlthough it is a question of fact whether the defendant performed the alleged acts, it is a question of law whether those facts constitute an unfair or deceptive . . . practice.\u201d RD&J Props, 165 N.C. App. at 748, 600 S.E.2d at 500-01 (citing First Atl. Mgmt., Corp. v. Dunlea Realty, Co., 131 N.C. App. 242, 252-53, 507 S.E.2d 56, 63 (1998)).\n3. Piercing the Corporate Veil\nFinally, Plaintiff sought to pierce Downtown Properties\u2019 corporate veil in order obtain the entry of a judgment against Defendant individually. \u201c[The Supreme Court of North Carolina] has enumerated three elements which support an attack on separate corporate entity under the instrumentality rule:\n\u201c(1) Control, not mere majority or complete stock control, but complete domination, not only of finances, but of policy and business practice in respect to the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as to this transaction had at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own; and\n(2) Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud or wrong, to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or a dishonest and unjust act in contravention of plaintiff\u2019s legal rights; and\n(3) The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury or unjust loss complained of.\u201d\nGlenn v. Wagner, 313 N.C. 450, 454-55, 329 S.E.2d 326, 330 (1985) (quoting Acceptance Corp. v. Spencer, 268 N.C. 1, 9, 149 S.E.2d 570, 576 (1966)). \u201cWe have previously considered the following factors in determining the level of control a corporate or individual defendant exercises over a corporation:\n1. Inadequate capitalization].]\n2. Non-compliance with corporate formalities.\n3. Complete domination and control of the corporation so that it has no independent identity.\n4. Excessive fragmentation of a single enterprise into separate corporations.\nEast Mkt. St. Square, Inc. v. Tycorp Pizza IV, Inc., 175 N.C. App. 628, 636, 625 S.E.2d 191, 198 (citing Glenn, 313 N.C. at 455, 329 S.E.2d at 330-31 (internal citations omitted), disc. review denied, 361 N.C. 166, 639 S.E.2d 649 (2006). However, it \u201cis not the presence or absence of any particular factor that is determinative. Rather, it is a combination of factors which... suggest that the corporate entity attacked had \u2018no separate mind, will or existence of its own\u2019 and was therefore the \u2018mere instrumentality or tool\u2019 of the dominant corporation.\u201d Glenn, 313 N.C. at 458, 329 S.E.2d at 332 (internal citation omitted).\nC. Analysis of Plaintiff\u2019s Arguments 1. Violation of LLC Act\nFirst, Plaintiff argues that the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant on the grounds that \u201cseveral genuine issues of material fact must be resolved to determine whether [Defendant] violated the North Carolina Limited Liability Company Act in a way that would cause her to be personally liable under the Act.\u201d Although Plaintiff contends that Defendant violated the LLC Act and suggests that these violations support a finding of liability on unjust enrichment and unfair and deceptive trade practice grounds, we conclude that Plaintiff has not established that Defendant\u2019s alleged violations of the LLC Act occurred or that any violations of the LLC Act would support a damage recovery in favor of Plaintiff.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06, which limits distributions to limited liability company members, provides that:\n(a) No distribution may be made if, after giving effect to the distribution:\n(1) The limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or\n(2) The limited liability company\u2019s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities])] . . .\nIn addition, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-07 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] manager or director who votes for or assents to a distribution in violation of [N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7] 57C-4-06 ... is personally liable to the limited liability company for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06.\u201d\nPlaintiff contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning the extent to which Defendant approved the sale of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06 and that, if Defendant \u201cis personally liable to Downtown Properties, the LLC would be able to pay some if not all of the judgment obtained by [Plaintiff].\u201d Put another way, Plaintiff\u2019s theory appears to be that, if Defendant approved a distribution to Downtown Properties\u2019 members in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06, Defendant would be liable to Downtown Properties pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-07 and Plaintiff would be entitled to benefit from Defendant\u2019s liability to Downtown Properties. We do not find Plaintiff\u2019s reasoning persuasive.\nAccording to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06, a manager\u2019s decision to approve the distribution of a limited liability company\u2019s assets to the members is improper only if, following the distribution, the LLC \u201cwould not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business\u201d or if the LLC\u2019s \u201ctotal assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities.\u201d All of the evidence contained in the present record tends to show that:\n1. Plaintiff terminated its lease with Downtown Properties in May 2007;\n2. Downtown Properties sold its real estate in September 2007;\n3. Plaintiff filed suit against Downtown Properties almost a year later, in August 2008; and\n4. Plaintiff did not obtain a default judgment against Downtown Properties until October 2008.\nPlaintiff has not forecast any evidence tending to show that, at the time that the asset sale and related distribution occurred, Downtown Properties was unable to pay its debts or that Downtown Properties\u2019 liabilities exceeded the value of its assets. In addition, Plaintiff has not cited any authority establishing that the entry of a default judgment against Downtown Properties more than a year after the challenged sale and distribution somehow establishes the existence of a debt that had become due \u201cin the usual course of business\u201d as of the date of the transaction in question. On the contrary, Plaintiff has simply asserted that the obligation evidenced by the default judgment should be treated as having been incurred in the \u201cregular course of Downtown Properties\u2019 business\u201d because \u201cthe \u2018main purpose\u2019 of the LLC was leasing the Property.\u201d However, given that Plaintiff did not file suit for the purpose of asserting its reimbursement claim until almost a year after the lease had been terminated and all of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets had been sold and given the absence of any record evidence establishing that Plaintiff informed Defendant or Downtown Properties of the existence of its claim prior to the date of the challenged sale and distribution, we are unable to ascertain how the transaction at issue here was effectuated in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06.\nSecondly, Plaintiff has failed to articulate any basis on which, at the time of the distribution, Downtown Properties should have expected that Plaintiff might succeed in a claim for reimbursement for the deposit and rent payments that it made to Downtown Properties prior to the termination of the lease. The lease was \u201cexpressly conditioned on the issuance or revocation\u201d of a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages. The lease does not, however, contain any language providing that, in the event that Plaintiff terminated the lease after failing to obtain authorization to sell alcoholic beverages, Plaintiff would be entitled to reimbursement of any monies paid while the lease was in effect. In addition, Plaintiff has not identified any statutory provision or common law principle giving it the right to seek reimbursement of the payments that it made to Downtown Properties prior to the termination of the lease. As a result, given the complete absence of any evidence tending to show that Plaintiff had a right to obtain reimbursement of the monies paid to Downtown Properties under the lease at the time of the challenged sale and distribution, the record does not provide any basis for believing that the sale and distribution of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets violated N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06.\nThirdly, even if the distribution of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets violated N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06, any liability to which Defendant would be subject pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-07 would lie in favor of Downtown Properties and not in favor of Plaintiff. In spite of its claim to be entitled to benefit from Defendant\u2019s alleged violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06, Plaintiff has not argued that it has the right to force Downtown Properties to sue Defendant, that Downtown Properties would be legally required to seek recovery from Defendant pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-07, or that Plaintiff has the ability to enforce any rights that Downtown Properties might have against Defendant. Simply put, Plaintiff has failed to cite any authority or advance any argument in support of the proposition that Plaintiff would be entitled to benefit from the fact that Downtown Properties might have a claim against Defendant, and we know of none. Thus, even if Defendant did, in fact, violate N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06 at the time that the distribution of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets occurred, there is no basis for believing that such a showing would in any way inure to Plaintiffs benefit.\nFinally, Plaintiff has failed to explain how any liability that Defendant might have to Downtown Properties based upon the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 57C-4-06 and 57C-4-07 would have any bearing on the viability of the specific claims that Plaintiff seeks to assert against Defendant. Plaintiff has not identified any nexus between the possibility that Defendant might be liable to Downtown Properties pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 57C-4-06 and 57C-4-07 and the elements of the unjust enrichment and unfair and deceptive trade practice claims that Plaintiff seeks to assert against Defendant. \u201cIt is not the duty of this Court to supplement an appellant\u2019s brief with legal authority or arguments not contained therein.\u201d Goodson v. P.H. Glatfelter Co., 171 N.C. App. 596, 606, 615 S.E.2d 350, 358, disc. rev. denied, 360 N.C. 63, 623 S.E.2d 582 (2005). As a result, we conclude that Plaintiff has failed to show that (1) the distribution of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets constituted a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-4-06; (2) that any legal rights stemming from any such violation would have accrued to Plaintiff rather than Downtown Properties; or (3) that any violation of the LLC Act which might have occurred provided any support for Plaintiffs unjust enrichment and unfair and deceptive trade practice claims. As a result, despite Plaintiffs argument in reliance on the LLC Act, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant.\n2. Uniust Enrichment\nSecondly, Plaintiff asserts that a \u201cgenuine issue of material fact remains as to whether [Defendant] was unjustly enriched to the detriment of [Plaintiff] by her acts as manager of Downtown Properties.\u201d Although Plaintiff concedes that Defendant forecast evidence tending to show that the assets of Downtown Properties were sold in September, 2007; that \u201cno assets of Downtown Properties\u201d had been distributed to Defendant after 2007; and that Defendant \u201cha[d] not been enriched or received anything of monetary value from Downtown Properties from 2007 to the date of this affidavit,\u201d Plaintiff argues that Defendant may have received something of value from the Paul W. Woo Revocable Trust and that, if so, \u201cshe may have been unjustly enriched.\u201d Plaintiff has failed, however, to articulate any connection between the possibility that Defendant might have received something from the Paul W. Woo Revocable Trust after 2007 and the elements of a claim for unjust enrichment. In addition, Plaintiff has not provided any evidentiary support for its claim that such a distribution may have occurred. As a result, we conclude that Plaintiff is not entitled to relief from the trial court\u2019s order based upon this argument.\n3. Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices\nThirdly, Plaintiff argues that, in the event that Defendant received anything of value from the Paul W. Woo Revocable Trust, her conduct as manager of Downtown Properties \u201cmay constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices.\u201d Once again, Plaintiff has failed to identify any record support for this assertion, to cite any authority in support of its position to this effect, or to otherwise explain how Plaintiff had a viable claim against Defendant pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1. As a result, Plaintiff is not entitled to obtain reversal of the trial court\u2019s order based on this logic.\n4. Violation of Public Policy\nFinally, Plaintiff argues that, if Defendant approved the sale of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets, her actions were \u201cagainst public policy.\u201d Once again, we conclude that Plaintiff\u2019s argument lacks merit.\nAccording to Plaintiff, Defendant \u201cassent[ed] to a distribution that create [d] a windfall for the member of the LLC at the expense of the creditors of the LLC.\u201d As we have already demonstrated, however, Plaintiff has not shown that it was, in fact, a \u201ccreditor\u201d of Downtown Properties at the time of the challenged distribution or that Defendant or Downtown Properties should have foreseen at that time that Downtown Properties might be liable to Plaintiff. In addition, although Plaintiff claims that Downtown Properties had \u201crefused to reimburse the good faith money that [Plaintiff] had paid,\u201d Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Downtown Properties had any obligation to make such a payment at the time of the disputed sale and distribution. Under that set of circumstances, we are unable to see what \u201cpublic policy\u201d was violated when the challenged distribution occurred, and Plaintiff has not cited any authority or advanced any argument explaining why the alleged public policy implications of Defendant\u2019s actions as manager of Downtown Properties would support reversal of the trial court\u2019s order. As a'result, we conclude that Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpublic policy\u201d argument lacks merit as well.\nIII. Conclusion\nThus, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant. As a result, the trial court\u2019s order should be, and hereby, is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\nJudges BRYANT and ELMORE concur.\n. Plaintiff argues that, in addition to the other alleged violations of the LLC Act discussed in the text, Defendant failed to honor her obligation to act in \u201cgood faith\u201d as set out in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 67C-3-22. However, given that the alleged basis for Defendant\u2019s lack of \u201cgood faith\u201d claim is her participation in the challenged distribution of Downtown Properties\u2019 assets and given that the same logic that has persuaded us to reject Plaintiff\u2019s arguments in reliance upon N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 57C-4-06 and 57C-4-07 support rejection of Plaintiff\u2019s argument in reliance upon N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-22 as well, we do not find Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d claim persuasive.", "author": "ERVIN, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["REV O, INC., Plaintiff-Appellant v.

Appeal and Error \u2014 mootness\u2014capable of repetition\u2014 evaded review\nThe State\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s order to unseal search warrants was not moot even though the warrants had already been unsealed and released as the matter was capable of repetition yet evaded review.\n2. Public Records \u2014 sealed search warrants \u2014 order unsealing records \u2014 complied with mandate\nThe trial court did not err in a case involving sealed search warrants by failing to give effect to the plain language in the original orders commanding that the records remain sealed and not released to the public until further order of the court. The trial court complied with the senior resident judge\u2019s mandate regarding the duration of orders sealing search warrants from public review.\n3. Public Records \u2014 delivery of previously sealed records to Clerk \u2014 hearing not required \u2014 sufficient notice given\u2014 compliance with mandate\nThe trial court did not err in a case involving sealed search warrants by ordering the clerk of court to deliver documents previously sealed by orders of the superior court without any motion, hearing, or notice to the State. As the prosecution failed to make a timely motion to extend the orders sealing the warrants, the trial court was not required to engage in a test to balance the right to access the contents of the sealed search warrants against the governmental interests in protecting against premature release. Further, the State\u2019s contention that it was not on notice of the delivery of these previously sealed records was rejected and the trial court\u2019s compliance with the senior resident judge\u2019s administrative order was not an abandonment of the court\u2019s obligation.\n4. Public Records \u2014 sealed search warrants \u2014 release\u2014not impermissible exercise of jurisdiction\nThe trial court\u2019s order releasing previously sealed search warrants and corresponding documents did not impermissibly exercise appellate jurisdiction to resolve a conflict between the administrative order and the prior orders issued sealing the search warrants. The order releasing the sealed warrants was not in conflict with the prior orders sealing the warrants.\n5. Public Records \u2014 sealed search warrants \u2014 release in accordance with administrative order .\nThe State\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in concluding that the administrative order at issue limited the discretion of the court in entering orders sealing warrants and related documents lacked merit. The search warrants and corresponding documents were unsealed in accordance with administrative procedures established by the senior resident superior court judge.\nAppeal by the State from order entered 30 November 2010 by Judge Nathaniel J. Poovey in Catawba County Superior Court. Heard in the Court of Appeals 16 November 2011.\nDistrict Attorney James G. Gaither, Jr., and Assistant District Attorney Eric R. Bellas for the State.\nStevens Martin Vaughn & Tadych, PLLC, by C. Amanda Martin, for defendant-appellee.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "BRYANT, Judge.\nWhere the search warrants at issue were unsealed in accordance with procedures set forth in the administrative order of the resident superior court judge and where the State failed to make a timely motion to extend the period for which the documents were sealed, there was no error by the superior court in unsealing the search warrants and corresponding documents.\nIn the afternoon of 9 October 2010, Zahra Baker, born 16 November 1999, was reported missing. Earlier that morning, just before 5:30 a.m., an officer with the Hickory Police Department, at the request of the Hickory Fire Department, responded to a residence located at 21 21st Avenue Northwest. The fire department had responded to a call reporting a burning pile of debris. A fireman drew the police officer\u2019s attention to a note found on the front windshield of a 1996 Chevrolet Tahoe located at the residence. The note stated \u201cMr. Coffey, you like being in control now who is in control we have your daughter and your pot smoking red head son is next unless you do what is asked 1,000,000 unmarked will be in touch soon.\u201d Mark Coffey and his only daughter were at the residence and determined to be unharmed. At 6:41 a.m., the officer and the Hickory Fire Department left the residence.\nAt 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, officers with the Hickory Police Department again responded to the residence after receiving a call from Adam Baker stating that the previous night someone left a note stating that his boss\u2019s daughter had been abducted. However, it was Baker\u2019s own daughter, Zahra, who was missing. Thereafter, an investigation ensued involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.\nOn 29 September 2010, prior to the issuance of any warrant in the case of Zahra\u2019s disappearance, an administrative order on sealing warrants was filed by Judicial District 25B Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Timothy S. Kincaid. The order set out the procedures applicable \u201cto a request to seal or redact an arrest or search warrant, a search warrant application, a search warrant affidavit, an inventory of seized items pursuant to a search warrant, or other similar court documents.\u201d The order was made effective for all sealing motions filed on or after 1 October 2010.\nBetween 11 and 29 October 2010, at least thirteen search warrants were issued in the investigation of the disappearance of Zahra Baker. The subject matter of the search warrants ranged between a search of persons, the residence at 21 21st Avenue Northwest, cell phone records, email accounts, and social networking site accounts. As each search warrant was issued, the State made a motion either in Catawba County Superior Court or Catawba County District Court for an order sealing the warrant and its return until further order of the Court. As to each motion, the court made the following finding:\n[I]t appearing to the Court that the release of information contained in said court order, application, and motion and its return will potentially undermine an ongoing investigation or jeopardize the right of the State to prosecute a defendant or defendants or jeopardize the right of a defendant or defendants to receive a fair trial....\nAs to each motion, the court ordered \u201cthat this search warrant and its return be sealed and not released to the public until further order of the Court.\u201d\nOn 29 November 2010, a number of news media organizations\u2014 print and television - made a public records request for search warrants more than thirty days old. Shortly thereafter, the State filed a motion and an amended motion to extend the orders sealing the warrants and their returns. On 30 November 2010, in response to the media\u2019s public records request, Catawba County Superior Court Judge Nathaniel Poovey ordered that search warrants sealed for more than thirty days at the time of the request be unsealed. The order specified that \u201cParagraph 10(c) of [Judge Kincaid\u2019s] Administrative Order [on sealing warrants] provides that any order directing that a warrant, warrant affidavit or other document be sealed or redacted shall expire in 30 days unless a different expiration date is specified in the order.\u201d Judge Poovey\u2019s order unsealing certain warrants found that the State filed a motion to extend the sealing of the orders after media organizations requested copies of search warrants that were more than 30 days old. The Superior Court ordered that \u201c[the] clerk shall immediately deliver copies of materials related to the eleven warrants that were sealed more than 30 days prior to the State\u2019s November 29 motion to anyone making such a request____\u201d The State, by and through the District Attorney, appeals.\nOn appeal, the State raises the following four issues: Did the lower court err (I) in not giving effect to the plain language in the original sealing orders; (II) by ordering the delivery of documents previously sealed by order of the court without any hearing, motion, or notice to the State; (III) by exercising appellate jurisdiction; and (IV) by concluding that an administrative order of general applicability limited the discretion of the trial court.\nThe State acknowledges that the documents affected by the superior court order have been unsealed and released but contends that the issue is not moot. The State contends that the matter falls within the exception to the mootness rule whereby an appellate court will hear a matter in dispute if such is capable of repetition yet evading review. The State cites In re Search Warrants Issued in Connection with the Investigation into the Death of Nancy Cooper, 200 N.C. App. 180, 683 S.E.2d 418 (2009).\nThis exception is applicable if \u2018(1) the challenged action is too short in duration to be fully litigated and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same party will be subjected to the same action again.\u2019 The search warrants and attendant documents were sealed for a thirty day period. \u2018[T]his kind of secrecy order is usually too short in duration to be litigated fully.\u2019 There is also a reasonable expectation that the issue of a party being denied access to a search warrant and related documents due to a sealing order would be capable of repetition.\nId. at 185, 683 S.E.2d at 423 (quoting Baltimore Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F.2d 60, 63 (4th Cir. 1989)). We agree, the matter is capable of repetition yet evades review. Accordingly, the appeal is not barred on grounds that the matter is moot.\nI\nIn its first argument, the State contends the trial court erred by failing to give effect to the plain language in the original orders commanding that the records remain sealed \u201cand not released to the public until further order of the Court.\u201d The State contends that Judge Poovey impermissibly modified the orders of four superior court judges by issuing an order unsealing eleven warrants and their associated documents on the basis of an administrative order which directed that documents sealed by court order be unsealed after thirty days. We disagree. In re J.S., 182 N.C. App. 79, 84, 641 S.E.2d 395, 397-98 (2007) (original brackets).\nThe General Assembly has authorized our Supreme Court to promulgate rules of practice and procedure for the superior and district courts. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-34 (2005). Pursuant to this authority, our Supreme Court requires the Senior Resident Judge and Chief District Judge in each judicial district to \u201ctake appropriate actions [such as the promulgation of local rules] to insure prompt disposition of any pending motions or other matters necessary to move the cases toward a conclusion.\u201d N.C. Gen. R. Prac. Super, and Dist. Ct. 2(d) (2007); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-146 (2005) (non-exclusive listing of the powers and duties of the Chief District Judge). \u201c \u2018Wide discretion should be afforded in [the] application [of local rules] so long as a proper regard is given to their purpose.\u2019 \u201d Lomax v. Shaw, 101 N.C. App. 560, 563, 400 S.E.2d 97, 98 (1991) (applying local superior court rules) (quoting Forman & Zuckerman v. Schupak, 38 N.C. App. 17, 21, 247 S.E.2d 266, 269 (1978)).\nAccess to public records in North Carolina is governed generally by our Public Records Act, codified as Chapter 132 of the North Carolina General Statutes. Chapter 132 provides for liberal access to public records. News & Observer Publ\u2019g Co. v. Poole, 330 N.C. 465, 475, 412 S.E.2d 7, 13 (1992). Absent \u201cclear statutory exemption or exception, documents falling within the definition of \u2018public records\u2019 in the Public Records Law must be made available for public inspection.\u201d Id. at 486, 412 S.E.2d at 19.\nVirmani v. Presbyterian Health Servs. Corp., 350 N.C. 449, 462, 515 S.E.2d 675, 685 (1999), quoted by In re Search Warrants of Cooper, 200 N.C. App. at 186, 683 S.E.2d at 424. Under North Carolina General Statutes, section 132-1.4(k), arrest and search warrants that have been returned by law enforcement agencies, indictments, criminal summons, and nontestimonial identification orders are public records. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 132-1.4(k) (2011).\nHere, the administrative order issued by Judge Kincaid set forth uniform procedures applicable to \u201c[any] request to seal or redact an arrest or search warrant, a search warrant application, a search warrant affidavit, an inventory of seized items pursuant to a search warrant, or other similar court documents\u201d made on or after 1 October 2010. Specifically, the order established that \u201c[a]ny order directing that a warrant affidavit or other document be sealed or redacted . . . [s]hall expire in thirty (30) days unless a different expiration date is specified in the order... .\u201d The administrative order further provided that \u201c[t]he State may move for an extension of an order sealing or redacting a court document, and the existing order shall remain in effect until the motion for extension is decided.\u201d\nJudge Poovey\u2019s order unsealing certain search warrants set out the following:\nWhen possible, orders shall be read in such a way as to resolve or avoid conflict. Such a reading of the administrative order and the various orders entered in the matter of the investigation of the disappearance of Zahra Clare Baker yields the result that the sealing orders were to remain in place for a maximum of 30 days but that time could be shortened by an order of the court or lengthened by further order upon a motion made by the State.\nJudge Poovey made the unchallenged finding that the State failed to make a motion for an extension of the orders sealing the search warrants and accompanying documents within the thirty-day period the warrants were sealed and did not file a motion to extend the period the warrants were sealed until after a request was made to unseal the documents. Therefore, in accordance with the administrative order establishing the procedure for sealing arrest or search warrants, Judge Poovey unsealed the applicable search warrants.\nGiven the wide discretion afforded the Senior Resident Superior Court Judge by our Supreme Court in the promulgation of local rules and because the State not only fails to show that Judge Poovey\u2019s order violated the administrative order of the Senior Resident Judge but rather illustrates Judge Poovey\u2019s compliance with the Senior Resident Judge\u2019s mandate regarding the duration of orders sealing search warrants from public review, the State\u2019s argument that Judge Poovey failed to give effect to the language in the orders commanding that the warrants remain sealed \u201cand not released to the public until further order of the Court\u201d is overruled. See In re J.S., 182 N.C. App. at 84, 641 S.E.2d at 397-98.\n. II\nThe State next argues that Judge Poovey erred by ordering the Clerk of Court to deliver documents previously sealed by orders of the Superior Court without any motion, hearing, or notice to the State. The State contends that by failing to make findings of fact with regard to grounds for unsealing the records requested, Judge Poovey failed to weigh the right of access to records against the compelling governmental interests sought to be protected by the prior orders and, thus, abandoned the obligation to protect against the premature release of the warrants and to protect the interests of the public, the State, and those potential defendants. We disagree.\nThe administrative order issued by Judge Kincaid in accordance with the authority conferred by our Supreme Court and effective at the time the search warrants in the investigation of Zahra\u2019s disappearance were issued and sealed, afforded an opportunity and corresponding procedure for the trial court to engage in the requested balancing test: the opportunity arose when the State made a motion to extend the orders sealing the warrants and their returns. See N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7A-34 (\u201cThe Supreme Court is hereby authorized to prescribe rules of practice and procedure for the superior and district courts supplementary to, and not inconsistent with, acts of the General Assembly.\u201d); N.C. Gen. R. Prac. Super, and Dist. Ct. 1 (2012) (\u201c[The general rules of practice for superior and district court] shall at all times be construed and enforced in such manner as to avoid technical delay and to permit just and prompt consideration and determination of all the business before them.\u201d); In re J.S., 182 N.C. App. at 84, 641 S.E.2d at 398 (\u201cWide discretion should be afforded in [the] application [of local rules] so long as a proper regard is given to their purpose.\u201d).\nHere, the prosecution failed to make a timely motion to extend the orders sealing the warrants and did not file a motion until after media organizations filed a public records request to view the warrants. Therefore, the administrative order did not require the trial court to engage in a test to balance the right to access the contents of the sealed search warrants against the governmental interests in protecting against premature release.\nAs for the State\u2019s assertion regarding the lack of notice, Judge Poovey\u2019s order unsealing the warrants made the unchallenged finding that copies of the Administrative Order were distributed to \u201cthe chief district judge, the district attorney, the clerk of superior court, the county attorney of Catawba County, the city attorneys for the municipalities in Catawba County, and to representatives of all municipal police departments.\u201d Further, the administrative order set out that \u201c[a]ny order directing that a warrant or warrant affidavit or other document be sealed or redacted . . . [s]hall expire in thirty (30) days unless a different expiration date is specified in the order . . . .\u201d We reject the State\u2019s contention that it was not on notice of the delivery of these previously sealed records. Furthermore, the media organizations made their public records request prior to but on the same day the State requested an extension of the orders sealing the records. The trial court ruled on the records request ordering the records unsealed the following day. Absent authority requiring a specific type of notice of release of documents, we find there was sufficient notice that the records could be released.\nWhile we state no opinion on the authority of a superior court to ex mero motu weigh the right of access'to sealed records against governmental interests, we do hold that Judge Poovey\u2019s unsealing of the warrants and corresponding documents in compliance with the administrative order of the senior resident superior court judge was not an abandonment of the court\u2019s obligation to protect the interests of the public, the State, and those potential defendants. The State does not challenge Judge Kincaid\u2019s authority to issue the administrative order nor the validity of the administrative order. To hold that Judge Poovey\u2019s compliance with Judge Kincaid\u2019s administrative order was an abandonment of the court\u2019s obligation would render impotent the authority to be exercised by senior resident superior court judges in accordance with the directive of our Supreme Court to prescribe rules of practice and procedure for the superior and district courts to be \u201cconstrued and enforced in such manner as to avoid technical delay and to permit just and prompt consideration and determination of all the business before them.\u201d N.C. Gen. R. Prac. Super, and Dist. Ct. 1.\nWe also note that Judge Poovey\u2019s order does acknowledge the long held judicial principles of openness, the presumptive right to access court records, and the need to narrowly tailor restrictions upon such a right. In so doing, it appears Judge Poovey considered the procedures set forth in the administrative order of Judge Kincaid, the notice of the administrative order provided to the District Attorney, the failure of the State to make a motion to extend the orders sealing the warrants, and the request by media organizations to review documents previously sealed by court orders for which the period of non-disclosure had expired. This does not constitute an abandonment of the court\u2019s obligation. Accordingly, this argument is overruled.\nIII\nNext, the State argues that Judge Poovey\u2019s order impermissibly exercised appellate jurisdiction to resolve a conflict between the administrative order and the prior orders issued sealing the search warrants. We disagree.\nAs we have reasoned, Judge Poovey\u2019s order releasing the sealed warrants and corresponding documents was not in conflict with the prior orders sealing the warrants and their returns \u201cuntil further order of the Court\u201d; therefore, we overrule this argument.\nIV\nLastly, the State argues that Judge Poovey erred in concluding that the administrative order limited the discretion of the court in entering orders sealing warrants and related documents.\nWe do not see that Judge Poovey concluded that the administrative order limited the discretion of the superior court, only that the search warrants and corresponding documents were unsealed in accordance with administrative procedures established by the senior resident superior court judge and in the absence of a timely motion by the State to extend the period of time for which the records were sealed. Accordingly, this argument is overruled.\nNo error.\nJudges CALABRIA and STROUD concur.\n. The information contained in thirteen search warrants and their returns was ordered sealed by four superior court judges and one district court judge over a period of two-and-a-half weeks. However, because the State\u2019s motion to extend the orders sealing the records was filed on Monday, 29 November 2010, Judge Poovey concluded that the State\u2019s motion was timely filed with regard to warrants sealed by court orders entered 27 and 29 October 2010.", "author": "BRYANT, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["IN THE MATTER OF ZAHRA CLARE BAKER INVESTIGATION"]}}}

For the following reasons, we order that juvenile receive a new hearing.\nI. Background\nOn 29 October 2010, three petitions (\u201cOctober petitions\u201d) were filed against juvenile for disorderly conduct at school, misdemeanor assault, and delinquency based upon juvenile allegedly \u201ckick[ing] another student in the groin area of his body, causing this student to fall to the ground in pain.\u201d On 8 December 2010, a petition (\u201cDecember petition\u201d) was filed against juvenile for delinquency based upon juvenile allegedly \u201cwantonly and willfully setfting] fire to and causing] to be burned an uninhabited house[.]\u201d (Original in all caps.) On 24 March 2011, the court heard both the October and December petitions. Petitioner dismissed its petitions as to disorderly conduct and assault inflicting serious injury and the juvenile admitted the allegation of simple assault, leaving the delinquent act alleged in the December petition, \u201cwantonly and willfully setfting] fire to and causing] to be burned an uninhabited house[,]\u201d (original in all caps), as the only contested matter for consideration at the adjudicatory hearing. Also on 24 March 2011, the court adjudicated the juvenile delinquent based upon the juvenile\u2019s admission of simple assault and upon the December petition. On 19 May 2011, the court entered a \u201cJUVENILE LEVEL 2 DISPOSITION ORDER (DELINQUENT)\u201d requiring juvenile be placed on probation for 12 months, cooperate with a community commitment program, pay $500.00 in restitution, abide by a curfew set by a \u201cCOURT COUNSELOR AND/OR PARENT[,]\u201d not associate with \u201cANYONE DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE BY COURT COUNSELOR AND/OR PARENT[,]\u201d not be anywhere it is \u201cUNLAWFUL FOR [a] JUVENILE TO BE[,]\u201d cooperate with a wildness program, be on house arrest by \u201cbe[ing] with parents or grandparents at ALL times[,]\u201d \u201cbe confined . . . [at] an approved detention facility\u201d for fourteen days, perform community service, and \u201cFOLLOW ALL OTHER COURT COUNSELORS RECOMMENDATIONS[.]\u201d Juvenile appeals.\nII. Witness List\nJuvenile contends that \u201cthe trial court erred when it failed to order the petitioner to publish a list of the witnesses it intended to call at trial when the juvenile followed the statutory requirement of filing a written request for the list.\u201d (Original in all caps.) \u201c[Juvenile] alleges a violation of a statutory mandate, and alleged statutory errors are questions of law. A question of law is reviewed de novo. Under the de novo standard, the Court considers the matter anew and freely substitutes its own judgment for that of the lower court.\u201d State v. Reeves,_N.C. App._,_, 721 S.E.2d 317, 322 (2012) (citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted).\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-2300(b) provides that\n[u]pon motion of the juvenile, the court shall order the petitioner to furnish the names of persons to be called as witnesses. A copy of the record of witnesses under the age of 16 shall be provided by the petitioner to the juvenile upon the juvenile\u2019s motion if accessible to the petitioner.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-2300(b) (2009) (emphasis added).\nOn 21 March 2011, juvenile filed a \u201cMOTION IN LIMINE FOR THE STATE TO DISCLOSE THE PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY AND RECORDS OF ALL STATE\u2019S WITNESSES AND A LIST OF WITNESSES IT INTENDS TO CALL AT TRIAL[.]\u201d According to the transcript, the petitioner provided the names of some witnesses to juvenile prior to the hearing, but the court never addressed juvenile\u2019s motion in limine. On 24 March 2011, the day of juvenile\u2019s hearing, the petitioner for the first time disclosed a new witness; this witness was the only eyewitness to testify that she had seen juvenile set a fire. Juvenile\u2019s attorney moved to continue the hearing so she could \u201cdo some investigationf.]\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel claimed that it only became aware of the witness \u201ctoday\u201d and had given juvenile\u2019s attorney an opportunity to speak with the witness earlier that day. The court denied the motion to continue. However, during the witness\u2019 testimony, she testified she had received a subpoena \u201cback in Decemberf.]\u201d\nWhile it appears from the transcript that more than one individual from the district attorney\u2019s office handled this case, it also appears clear from the witness\u2019s testimony that petitioner was aware of her as a witness long before the date of juvenile\u2019s hearing. Petitioner\u2019s brief essentially concedes this point. Furthermore, the witness was an important one as she was the only eyewitness to testify that she saw juvenile start a fire. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-2300(b) mandates that when requested the petitioner shall disclose the names of witnesses to juvenile, and it is clear that this witness was certainly material to the case against juvenile. Contrast In re Coleman, 55 N.C. App. 673, 673-74, 286 S.E.2d 621, 622 (1982) (concluding that respond-ent should not receive a new hearing where State did not disclose a document but it was unclear \u201c(1) whether the document contains information required by statute to be disclosed, and (2) whether the information would be favorable or material to respondent\u2019s case\u201d). We thus agree with juvenile that the court erred in failing to allow her motion in limine, continue the case, or find another way to remedy a situation created by the petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the plain mandate of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-2300(b). See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7b-2300(b). Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with a statutory mandate and the court\u2019s failure to remedy the situation was prejudicial as with more notice juvenile may have been able to impeach this material witness and thus may not have been adjudicated delinquent for setting a fire and would not have received the disposition as ordered by the court. See generally State v. Godley, 140 N.C. App. 15, 26, 535 S.E.2d 566, 574-75 (2000) (\u201cTo show prejudicial error, a defendant has the burden of showing that there was a rea sonable possibility that a different result would have been reached at trial if such error had not occurred.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)), disc. review denied, 353 N.C. 387, 547 S.E.2d 25, cert denied, 532 U.S. 964, 149 L.Ed. 2d 384 (2001).\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that juvenile must receive a new hearing. As juvenile is receiving a new hearing, we need not address her other issue on appeal.\nNEW HEARING.\nJudges ELMORE and STEELMAN concur.", "author": "STROUD, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["IN THE MATTER OF A.M.

For the following reasons, we reverse and remand the award of attorney\u2019s fees.\nI. Background\nPlaintiff leased a room in a student apartment from defendant Campus Habitat, L.L.C., (\u201cCampus\u201d) and this dispute began when plaintiff claimed that defendant Campus had breached the housing agreement (\u201cagreement\u201d), causing her to move out and stop paying rent. On or about 10 March 2010, plaintiff filed a complaint regarding breach of the agreement and requested a declaratory judgment, temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunction. On 12 May 2010, defendant Campus Habitat 2, L.L.C. (\u201cCampus 2\u201d) filed a motion to dismiss and defendant Campus Habitat, L.L.C. (\u201cCampus\u201d) filed an answer and counterclaimed for breach in the amount of $3,090.00.

On 1 July 2011, the trial court entered a judgment ordering defendant Campus recover $3,090.00 from plaintiff \u201cby way of judgment\u201d and $4,458.50 from plaintiff \u201cas reimbursement for . . . attorney\u2019s fees[.]\u201d Plaintiff appeals.\nII. Attorney\u2019s Fees\nThe only issues plaintiff raises on appeal are regarding the award of attorney\u2019s fees.\nThe case law in North Carolina is clear that to overturn the trial judge\u2019s determination on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, the defendant must show an abuse of discretion. However, where an appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation, full review is appropriate, and we review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo.\nBruning & Federle Mfg. Co. v. Mills, 185 N.C. App. 153, 155-56, 647 S.E.2d 672, 674 (citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted), cert denied, 362 N.C. 86, 655 S.E.2d 837 (2007).\nA. Notice\nPlaintiff first claims that pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2 defendant Campus failed to properly notify her it was seeking attorney\u2019s fees. In its judgment, the trial court noted it was awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2 which provides:\nThe holder of an unsecured note or other writing(s) evidencing an unsecured debt, and/or the holder of a note and chattel mortgage or other security agreement and/or the holder of a conditional sale contract or any other such security agreement which evidences both a monetary obligation and a security interest in or a lease of specific goods, or his attorney at law, shall, after maturity of the obligation by default or otherwise, notify the maker, debtor, account debtor, endorser or party sought to be held on said obligation that the provisions relative to payment of attorneys\u2019 fees in addition to the \u201coutstanding balance\u2019\u2019 shall be enforced and that such maker, debtor, account debtor, endorser or party sought to be held on said obligation has five days from the mailing of such notice to pay the \u201coutstanding balance\u201d without the attorneys\u2019 fees. If such party shall pay the \u201coutstanding balance\u201d in full before the expiration of such time, then the obligation to pay the attorneys\u2019 fees shall be void, and no court shall enforce such provisions.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2(5) (2009) (emphasis added).\nIn Wilson Bldg. Co. v. Thorneburg Hosiery Co., 85 N.C. App. 684, 355 S.E.2d 815, disc. review denied, 320 N.C. 798, 361 S.E.2d 75 (1987), this Court stated:\nThe notice provision of G.S. 6-21.2(5) simply provides that the obligor will have five days notice to pay any outstanding balance on the debt before the claimant goes to the expense of employing counsel to collect the balance due. In our opinion, the notice provision has no application in this situation where the obligor has refused to pay Wilson\u2019s claim and demanded arbitration pursuant to the terms of the contract. Wilson was forced into the position of having to employ counsel not only to collect its own claim, but also to protect it against Thomeburg\u2019s claim because of Thorneburg\u2019s demand of arbitration. When Wilson filed its response to Thorneburg\u2019s demand for arbitration, and its own claim for the balance due on the contract, it clearly notified Thorneburg it was demanding attorneys\u2019 fees under the terms of the contract.\nId. at 688-89, 355 S.E.2d at 818.\nHere, defendant Campus was in the same position as Wilson. See id. at 689, 355 S.E.2d at 818. Plaintiff filed a complaint and thus defendant Campus\nwas forced into the position of having to employ counsel not only to collect its own claim, but also to protect it against [the plaintiff\u2019s] claim .... When [defendant Campus] filed its response to [the plaintiff\u2019s] demand . . . and its own claim for the balance due on the contract, it clearly notified [the plaintiff] it was demanding attorneys\u2019 fees under the terms of the contract.\nId. Accordingly, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2(5) is inapplicable to this situation. See id. Thus, this argument is overruled.\nB. Amount\nPlaintiff next contends the attorney\u2019s fees awarded were more than allowed by statute. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2(2) provides;\nIf such note, conditional sale contract or other evidence of indebtedness provides for the payment of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees by the debtor, without specifying any specific percentage, such provision shall be construed to mean fifteen percent (15%) of the \u201coutstanding balance\u201d owing on said note, contract or other evidence of indebtedness.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2(2) (2009). Here, defendant Campus counterclaimed for $3,090.00, the amount owing on the agreement. The trial court found that \u201c[t]he amount owed by the Plaintiff to the Defendant pursuant to the lease agreement for unpaid rent is $3,090.00\u201d and ordered plaintiff pay defendant Campus this amount. The trial court further ordered plaintiff pay $4,458.50 in attorney\u2019s fees. Fifteen percent of $3,090.00 is $463.50; the trial court therefore awarded nearly ten times the amount allowed by statute, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2(2). See id.\nDefendant Campus contends that although the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees specifically pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2, the trial court could have awarded attorney fees under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-263, and the trial court had discretion under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-263 to exceed 15% of $3,090.00. However, the trial court here clearly stated it was awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2. The trial court made no mention in open court or in the judgment of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-263 and made no findings of fact or conclusions of law which would indicate that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-263 played any part in its determination. In addition, there is no indication in the transcript or communications between the trial court and counsel in the record that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-263 was argued or considered as a basis for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Under these circumstances, we cannot assume that the trial court made a clerical error in its reference to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2 instead of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-263. The award of attorney\u2019s fees of more than 15% of the \u201coutstanding balance\u201d is in. violation of the stated statute. Id. Accordingly, we reverse the award and remand for entry of an award of attorney\u2019s fees which is in compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 6-21.2.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\nJudges ELMORE and STEELMAN concur.", "author": "STROUD, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["JESSICA LEIGH FINCH, Plaintiff v.

Further, the State did not seek to introduce any portion of defendant\u2019s juvenile record, so no in camera hearing was needed under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-3000(f) and the evidence fell squarely under Rule 404(a).\n2. Evidence \u2014 witness testimony \u2014 co-defendant in prison for murder \u2014 no plain error\nDefendant\u2019s argument in a first-degree murder case that the trial court committed plain error when it allowed the State to introduce evidence that defendant\u2019s \u201cco-defendant\u201d was already in prison for murder was overruled. Even assuming that the person characterized as a \u201cco-defendant\u201d was involved in the same events for which defendant was charged, and that the trial court erred in allowing evidence of this co-defendant\u2019s prior conviction for murder, in light of the remaining evidence, any alleged error by the trial court did not amount to plain error.\nAppeal by defendant from judgments entered 15 June 2011 by Judge Hugh B.

Nance, for the State.\nGlenn Gerding, for defendant-appellant.", "corrections": "", "opinions": [{"text": "STROUD, Judge.\nDefendant appeals his two convictions for first degree murder. For the following reasons, we find no error.\nI. Background\nThe State\u2019s evidence tended to show that on 1 July 2008, defendant confessed to shooting two people in self-defense; an eyewitness told detectives that defendant had committed the shootings. No weapons were found on or around either of the victims and both were shot more than once. On or about 14 July 2008, defendant was indicted for two counts of murder. On 25 May 2011, defendant filed notice that he \u201cintendfed] to offer the defense of self-defense[.]\u201d After a trial by jury, defendant was found guilty of two counts of first degree murder. Defendant was twice sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Defendant appeals.\nII. Standard of Review\nDefendant argues only plain error before this Court.\nThe plain error rule is always to be applied cautiously and only in the exceptional case where, after reviewing the entire record, it can be said the claimed error is a fundamental error, something so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been done, or where the error is grave error which amounts to a denial of a fundamental right of the accused, or the error has resulted in a miscarriage of justice or in the denial to appellant of a fair trial or where the error is such as to seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings or where it can be fairly said the instructional mistake had a probable impact on the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was guilty.\nState v. Odom, 307 N.C. 655, 660, 300 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1983) (citation, quotation marks, ellipses, and brackets omitted).\nIII. Other Crimes\nDefendant called his mother to testify as to his character, and she specifically described defendant as a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d and stated that she had not seen any \u201ckind of violent part in\u201d defendant. On cross examination, the State questioned defendant\u2019s mother as to her knowledge that defendant had previously been \u201cconvicted of crimes\u201d including armed robberies and that he had \u201cpistol whipped\u201d a person; defendant\u2019s mother acknowledged most of these actions by defendant but held to her testimony as to defendant\u2019s peaceful nature. Defendant first contends that \u201cthe trial court committed plain error when it allowed the State to introduce evidence . . . [defendant] had been charged with and convicted of crimes involving armed robberies even though . . . [defendant] never testified.\u201d (Original in all caps.)\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404 provides in pertinent part as follows:\n(a) Character evidence generally. \u2014 Evidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of his character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:\n(1) Character of accused. \u2014 Evidence of a pertinent trait of his character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same[.]\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404(a)(1) (2007). N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 405(a) provides that \u201c[i]n all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 405(a) (2007).\nDefendant argues that his mother\u2019s testimony as to his peaceful nature did not \u201copen the door\u201d to the State\u2019s cross examination as to his prior crimes; we disagree. In State v. Roseboro, 351 N.C. 536, 528 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1019, 148 L.Ed. 2d 498 (2000), our Supreme Court determined that evidence of defendant\u2019s prior violent acts against his wife was admissible, as defendant had called witnesses to testify to his peaceful nature:\nA criminal defendant is entitled to introduce evidence of his good character, thereby placing his character at issue. The State in rebuttal can then introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s bad character. Such evidence offered by the defendant or the prosecution in rebuttal must be a pertinent trait of his character.. . . Defendant placed his character at issue by having members of his family testify about his reputation for nonviolence or peacefulness, a pertinent trait of his character. In accordance with Rule 405(a), the prosecutor then cross-examined these witnesses about whether they knew of or had heard any accusations that defendant had hit or been violent toward his wife.\nDefendant argues that the prosecutor failed to limit his inquiry only to specific instances of misconduct by defendant by asking very general questions about whether the witnesses knew about any violence in the marriage or allegations of violence. Given that defendant\u2019s character witnesses testified that defendant was not a violent person, the prosecution was entitled to probe their knowledge of defendant\u2019s violence in his marriage. Such an inquiry was directed at specific instances of defendant\u2019s misconduct in the context of his marriage, not just general charges of violent behavior. On this basis, defendant\u2019s argument that the prosecutor elicited irrelevant information concerning problems in defendant\u2019s marriage is without merit.\n351 N.C. 536, 553, 528 S.E.2d 1, 12 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Just as in Roseboro, here defendant\u2019s mother also testified that defendant was not a violent person, placing \u201ca pertinent trait of his character\u201d at issue. Id. The State\u2019s questions regarding defendant\u2019s prior crimes fall squarely under Rule 404(a)(1), as they were in rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s character evidence as to his peaceful nature.\nDefendant further argues that even if his mother\u2019s testimony \u201copened the door\u201d to the State\u2019s cross examination, his prior crimes were juvenile adjudications, and the use of evidence of a juvenile adjudication is limited by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(f), which provides:\nThe juvenile\u2019s record of an adjudication of delinquency for an offense that would be a Class A, Bl, B2, C, D, or E felony if committed by an adult may be used in a subsequent criminal proceeding against the juvenile either under G.S. 8C-1, Rule 404(b), or to prove an aggravating factor at sentencing under G.S. 15A-1340.4(a), 15A-1340.16(d), or 15A-2000(e). The record may be so used only by order of the court in the subsequent criminal proceeding, upon motion of the prosecutor, after an in camera hearing to determine whether the record in question is admissible.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(f) (2007). Defendant argues that even if his prior adjudications were admissible, the trial court failed to hold an in camera hearing to determine the admissibility of his juvenile record.\nDefendant\u2019s reliance upon N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(f) is misplaced for two reasons. First, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(f) specifically addresses the use of juvenile court records. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(a) defines the juvenile \u201crecord\u201d as this term is used by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(f):\nThe clerk shall maintain a complete record of all juvenile cases filed in the clerk\u2019s office to be known as the juvenile record. The record shall include the summons and petition, any secure or nonsecure custody order, any electronic or mechanical recording of hearings, and any written motions, orders, or papers filed in the proceeding.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(a) (2007).\nThe State did not seek to introduce any portion of defendant\u2019s juvenile record, so no in camera hearing was needed. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(f). Juvenile records include far more information than the simple fact of an adjudication. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(a). The State\u2019s questions on cross examination only inquired as to defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s knowledge of defendant\u2019s prior crimes. Secondly, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-3000(f) mentions use of juvenile records under Rule 404(b), not Rule 404(a)(1), and this evidence falls squarely under Rule 404(a), not Rule 404(b). Accordingly, this argument is overruled.\nIV. Co-Defendant in Prison\nDuring defendant\u2019s trial, on direct examination by the State, Ms. Shay Hammond testified that on the day of the murders she had seen defendant with \u201cBlack.\u201d The State questioned Ms. Hammond about Black\u2019s current whereabouts and she testified that he was in prison for \u201c[s]everal things\u201d including murder. Defendant also contends \u201cthe trial court committed plain error when it allowed the State to introduce evidence . . . [defendant\u2019s] co-defendant was already in prison for murder.\u201d (Original in all caps.) We note that there is no evidence in the record before us that defendant had a co-defendant; our record indicates defendant was tried alone. It is also not clear from the testimony that the \u201cmurder\u201d Black was imprisoned for was the same incident which led to defendant\u2019s charges. However, assuming that the person characterized as a \u201cco-defendant\u201d was involved in the same events for which defendant was charged, and that the trial court erred in allowing in evidence of this co-defendant\u2019s prior conviction for murder, in light of the evidence we have already noted, including defendant\u2019s confession, the fact that no weapons were found on or around either of the victims, and the evidence presented showing both of the victims were shot more than once, we cannot say any alleged error by the trial court amounted to plain error. See id.\nV. Conclusion\nFor .the foregoing reasons, we find no plain error.\nNO ERROR.\nJudges ELMORE and STEELMAN concur.\n. We note that although Rule 404(b) is not applicable in this case, some juvenile records are admissible under Rule 404(b), including evidence of \u201can offense that would be a Class A, Bl, B2, C, D, or E felony if committed by an adult[.]\u201d N.C.

(\u201cVCPOA\u201d) and VCPOA President Allen E. Renz (\u201cRenz\u201d) (\u201ccollectively defendants\u201d). Plaintiffs argue that the Amended Covenants enacted by the property owners of Village Creek are invalid; that resubdivision of lots is not permissible in Village Creek; and that plaintiffs produced sufficient evidence of a breach of fiduciary duty by Renz, and, therefore, summary judgment was not appropriate as to that cause of action. An opinion affirming the trial court\u2019s order was filed by this Court on 21 February 2012. Plaintiffs filed a Petition for Rehearing, which was granted on 2 April 2012. Upon reexamination, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order, but we modify the originally filed opinion. This opinion supersedes the previous opinion filed on 21 February 2012.\nBackground\nVillage Creek is a residential subdivision located in Chowan County, North Carolina. The subdivision was developed in 1986 by Chowan Storage Company and originally contained 45 lots. A Declaration of Restrictive Covenants for Village Creek was filed on 3 July 1986 and was later modified and amended by the Village Creek Amended Declaration of Restrictive Covenants (\u201cthe Covenants\u201d). Pursuant to Section 23 of the Covenants, which provided for the incorporation of a homeowners association in which all lot owners would be members, the VCPOA was incorporated on 16 April 1987.\nRenz moved to Village Creek in July 2000 and purchased a house one lot away from the Thompson family. Renz and the Thompsons each bought one half of the lot that separated them and then combined each half with their respective lots. Plaintiffs moved to Village Creek in September 2002. In 2005, plaintiffs learned that multiple lot owners, like Renz, were only required to pay assessments on a per-unit-owned basis and not on a per-lot-owned basis. In other words, multiple lot owners were only paying dues based on a single lot ownership, even though they technically owned more than one lot. Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the VCPOA and the multiple lot owners, which resulted in entry of a Consent Judgment stating that the Covenants required that assessments be paid on a per-lot-owned basis. Renz had become president of the VCPOA by the time the Consent Judgment was entered.\nOn 2 December 2006, the VCPOA Board of Directors, including Renz in his role as president, sent a letter to property owners informing them that for the first time in 20 years they had a right to amend the Covenants. Among the areas for possible amendment were the method of assessment and the subdividing of lots. First, the Board made it clear that they felt that the manner in which they were now required to assess fees pursuant to the Consent Judgment was \u201cunfair in terms of value received by the homeowners relative to the expense actually incurred on their behalf by the Association.\u201d Second, the Board acknowledged that the Covenants prohibited the subdivision of lots, but that subdividing had occurred in the past. The VCPOA Board of Directors recommended that the Covenants be amended to \u201cretain the prohibition of building homes on anything less than a full lot,\u201d while simultaneously \u201cvalidating] the legitimacy of previously-combined lots or portions of lots and permit combination of lots or portions of lots in the future . . . .\u201d The letter indicated that a vote of a majority of lot owners was necessary to amend the Covenants. On 6 December 2006, plaintiffs responded with a letter accusing the VCPOA of violating the terms of the Consent Judgment and stating that plaintiffs would challenge any change in the Covenants that were enacted without 100% approval of the property owners.\nDespite plaintiffs\u2019 objections, the' VCPOA continued with the covenant amendment process. A special meeting was held in March 2007 where a majority of lot owners consented to and approved the Amended Covenants. The Amended Covenants specified that assessments would be levied on an original platted lot basis and allowed subdivision of lots prospectively. On 4 April 2007, the Amended Covenants were filed with the Chowan County Register of Deeds. On 31 October 2007, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging: (1) breach of contract against the VCPOA; (2) a derivative proceeding against the VCPOA; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty against Renz. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and, on 1 November 2010, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs in part and in favor of defendants in part. The trial court determined that: (1) the amended covenants were properly adopted; (2) the provisions in the amended covenants changing the manner of making assessments were not reasonable, and, therefore, were invalid; (3) \u201cthe provisions for changes, divisions, or combination of lots\u201d were reasonable and valid; and (4) Renz did not breach his fiduciary duty. The trial court ruled in favor of defendants \u201cas to all other issues regarding the 2007 Amended and Restated Declaration.\u201d\nOn 3 December 2010, plaintiffs appealed from the portions of the judgment that granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Defendants did not appeal.\nStandard of Review\n\u201cOur standard of review of an appeal from summary judgment is de novo; such judgment is appropriate only when the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In re Will of Jones, 362 N.C. 569, 573, 669 S.E.2d 572, 576 (2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\nDiscussion\nI.\nWe first address plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the amendments made to the Covenants are invalid pursuant to Paragraph 33 of the Covenants. Generally, restrictive covenants are contractual in nature and a deed incorporating covenants \u201cimplies the existence of a valid contract with binding restrictions.\u201d Moss Creek Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Bissette, 202 N.C. App. 222, 228, 689 S.E.2d 180, 184 (2010). Restrictive covenants should be strictly construed and any ambiguities should be resolved in favor of the unrestrained use of land. Id. at 228, 689 S.E.2d at 184-85. Nonetheless, effect must be given to the intention of the parties and strict construction may not be used to defeat the plain and obvious meaning of a restriction. Id. at 228, 689 S.E.2d at 185.\nParagraph 33 states:\nNotwithstanding any provision contained herein, Declarant, its successors or assigns, reserves the right to amend, modify or vacate any restriction or covenant herein contained if and only if the restriction or covenant shall be in conflict with an ordinance or other official action by the Town of Edenton and then only to the extent necessary to bring the applicable restriction and covenant into conformity with said ordinance or action of the Town of Edenton.\nThere is no indication that the Amended Covenants approved in 2007 were for this purpose. However, Paragraph 3 of the Covenants states:\nThese covenants and restrictions shall be binding upon the owners and the lands of Village Creek for a period of twenty (20) years from the date of recording of this instrument. They shall be extended automatically for successive periods of ten (10) years unless, prior to the expiration of any term, an instrument executed by the majority of the then owners of lots in Village Creek has been recorded with the Chowan County Register of Deeds revoking or modifying this instrument.\nPlaintiffs contend that Paragraph 3 is subject to the limitation in Paragraph 33, stating amendments may be made \u201cif and only if the restriction or covenant shall be in conflict with an ordinance or other official action by the Town of Edenton . . . .\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is without merit.\nThe plain and unambiguous language in Paragraph 3 of the Covenants states that prior to the expiration of any term, the restrictions in the Covenants may be modified if a majority of lot owners file an instrument with the Chowan County Register of Deeds modifying the Covenants. This provision does not conflict with Paragraph 33, which allows amendments to the Covenants at any time, \u201c[notwithstanding\u201d the other provisions in the Covenants, so long as the purpose of the amendment is to bring the Covenants into compliance with the ordinances of the Town of Edenton. In sum, there are two methods to amend the Covenants, one pursuant to Paragraph 3 and the other pursuant to Paragraph 33. Paragraph 3 is not'subject to the limitation set out in Paragraph 33.\nHere, the Covenants were amended pursuant to the procedure set out in Paragraph 3 prior to the expiration of the first 20-year term and were to be effective at the beginning of the next term. The Amended Covenants, dated 15 March 2007, were signed by a majority of Village Creek lot owners, which satisfies the requirement for modification in Paragraph 3 of the Covenants. These Amended Covenants were then filed with the Chowan County Register of Deeds on 4 April 2007, satisfying the other modification requirement in Paragraph 3. As a result, the Covenants were properly amended, prior to the expiration of the first 20-year term, according to the language of Paragraph 3. Consequently, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that the Covenants were lawfully amended based on the language of Paragraph 3.\nII.\nNext, plaintiffs seem to argue that lots should not have been resubdivided prior to 2007 because Paragraph 7 of the original Covenants prohibited resubdivision of lots in Village Creek, particularly with regard to resubdivision by individual owners as opposed to the developer. Paragraph 7 of the Covenants stated the following prior to the 2007 amendment: \u201cNo lots may be resubdivided. Two or more adjacent lots may be made into one lot for one residential structure with the setback above stated to apply to outside, perimeter lot lines of said lots as combined.\u201d Despite the clear language of Paragraph 7, lots in Village Creek were still resubdivided. Between 1989 and 2003, seven of the original lots were resubdivided, the first three of these were resubdivided by the developer, Chowan Storage Company. In 2007, Paragraph 7 of the Covenants was modified to allow for the division and combination of lots subject to some limitations. It is clear that resubdivision of lots going forward is valid so long as it is done pursuant to the methods described in Paragraph 7 of the Amended Covenants.\nPlaintiffs do not argue that the trial court erred in determining that amended Paragraph 7 is valid and reasonable. Plaintiffs appear to be challenging the resubdivision that occurred in violation of the original Covenants prior to 2007. Plaintiffs do not make it clear exactly what remedy they seek with regards to the lots that have already been resubdivided. Plaintiffs\u2019 brief merely makes the argument that Paragraph 7 of the original Covenants did not allow for lots to be resubdivided, which is likely true but no longer an issue under the Amended Covenants. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint asked the trial court for an \u201corder remedying and setting aside any resubdivision of lots\u201d without alleging a specific claim or cause of action pertaining to the prior resubdivision of lots. The lot owners who resubdivided prior to 2007 were not parties to this action.\nIn sum, neither the plaintiffs\u2019 brief nor their complaint makes it clear what remedy plaintiffs sought with regard to individual lot owners who resubdivided their property under the original Covenants and whose resubdivision is now valid under the Amended Covenants. The trial court did not rule on the validity of prior resubdivisions. As such, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201cthe provision for changes, division or combination of lots in the 2007\u201d Amended Covenants is \u201cvalid\u201d and \u201creasonable.\u201d\nIII.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that sufficient evidence was presented regarding Renz\u2019s alleged breach of his fiduciary duty such that summary judgment was improperly entered in favor of Renz. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that Renz included misleading and false statements in his communications about amending the Covenants because he had a personal economic interest in the outcome. While the debate over amending the Covenants was ongoing, Renz was the president of the VCPOA, which was a non-profit corporation. The duties of directors and officers of a non-profit corporation are set out in the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8 et seq. (2009).\nAccording to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8-30(a) (2009), a director must discharge his duties in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. In doing so, a director may rely on information, opinions, and statements provided by legal counsel or other professionals. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8-30(b)(2). If a director performs his duties in compliance with this statute then he is not liable for any actions taken as director. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55A-8-30(d).\nThe majority of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence regarding this issue consists of statements from letters that Renz sent to Village Creek owners in his role as president of the VCPOA. Plaintiffs contend that Renz did not fully explain the situation in his letters; that he misled lot owners as to the issues; and that he explained matters in a way that would benefit his own economic interests while discounting opposing opinions.\nWhile the allegations made by plaintiffs certainly indicate that plaintiffs and Renz were on separate sides of the issues, they do not establish a genuine issue of material fact. None of the examples suggest that Renz was not acting in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner the director reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation. Indeed, many of the examples cited by plaintiffs highlight the differences of opinion that plaintiffs and Renz had with regard to interpretation of the Covenants and how Village Creek should be run in the future. Renz expressed his point of view regarding the amendments and plaintiffs did the same, as evidenced by a letter plaintiffs sent to other property owners expressing concerns and displeasure with Renz and the proposed Amended Covenants.\nIt is relevant to point out that Renz did request a written legal opinion prior to proceeding with the plan to amend the Covenants. The attorney stated that the Covenants could be amended pursuant to Paragraph 3, but expressed some concerns about the reasonableness of amending the Covenants to require assessments on a per-unit-owned basis. In a letter sent to the Village Creek property owners on 23 February 2007, Renz informed them that he had further discussed the matter with the attorney, and that the attorney was of the opinion that the proposed amendment would likely be deemed reasonable by a court should the matter be litigated; however, Renz attached the written opinion of the attorney in which the attorney expressed some doubts as to the reasonableness of the amendment. There is no indication that Renz engaged in any deceptive tactics. To the contrary, he hired an attorney on behalf of the VCPOA and took measures to ensure that the property owners were kept apprised of the attorney\u2019s written conclusions and subsequent conversations Renz had with the attorney.\nPlaintiffs are correct in pointing out that Renz had a personal economic interest in the amendments because he was a multiple lot owner. Nevertheless, there is evidence that those who voted to approve the Amended Covenants were aware that Renz was a multiple lot owner and therefore had an interest in the outcome of the votes. In a letter from plaintiffs to all Village Creek property owners, Renz is referred to as a \u201cmultiple lot owner.\u201d Further, in a letter written by Renz to property owners prior to the vote, he indicated that he was a multiple lot owner. Assuming, arguendo, that plaintiffs established that Renz acted in a manner incompatible with his fiduciary duty, this letter evidences that Renz acted in an open, fair, and honest manner. Estate of Smith v. Underwood, 127 N.C. App. 1, 9, 487 S.E.2d 807, 812 (\u201cOnce a plaintiff establishes aprima facie case of the existence of a fiduciary duty, and its breach, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove he acted in an \u2018open, fair and honest\u2019 manner, so that no breach of fiduciary duty occurred.\u201d (citation omitted)), disc. review denied, 347 N.C. 398, 494 S.E.2d 410 (1997). Knowing of Renz\u2019s personal interest and other material facts, the property owners still voted to amend the Covenants.\nIn sum, the evidence presented by plaintiffs does not indicate that Renz breached his fiduciary duty and merely shows that he had a differing opinion from plaintiffs on a number of issues regarding the Covenants and Village Creek. Renz sought legal counsel on behalf of the VCPOA; the property owners were aware of Renz\u2019s status as a multiple lot owner; and there is no indication that the procedure for amendment stated in the Covenants was not properly followed. As such, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Renz.\nConclusion\nBased on the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the above issues. We affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\nAffirmed.\nJudges GEER and HUNTER, Robert N., Jr. concur.", "author": "HUNTER, Robert C., Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["ARTHUR C.

For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for' a new hearing.\nI. Background\nOn or about 11 February 2011, defendant pled guilty to various offenses; defendant was placed on supervised probation. On 16 June 2011, defendant was informed that a hearing would be held regarding his violation of the conditions of probation. On 17 June 2011, defendant signed a \u201cWAIVER OF COUNSEL\u201d form (\u201cwaiver form\u201d) noting that he waived his \u201cright to assigned counsel\u201d but that he did not waive his \u201cright to all assistance of counsel which includes my right to assigned counsel and my right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added). Furthermore, on the waiver form defendant did not check the box indicating that he \u201cdesire [d] to appear in [his] own behalff.]\u201d In summary, the waiver form indicated that defendant had waived his right to assigned counsel but intended to hire his own counsel and did not desire to proceed pro se. On 27 June 2011, at defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing, the following dialogue took place:\nMS. HORNER [State\u2019s attorney]: Marvin Ramirez.\nMr. Ramirez is at 61 and 64 on the probation calendar. Mr. Ramirez previously waived counsel on June 17th, 2011. Mr. Ramirez, are you ready to proceed today?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nMS. HORNER: And are you ready to proceed without a lawyer?\nTHE DEFENDANT: When I went to my first appearance, I was going \u2014 when they asked me did I want to hire a lawyer or have an appointed attorney, I told them I would hire one because of the new charge I had.\nMS. HORNER: Your Honor, in this particular case, he did waive on June 17th, 2011; however, because of the anticipated request today, I\u2019m- not sure of the Court\u2019s position as to reconsidering.\nTHE COURT: If he waived, we\u2019re ready to go.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Ramirez, is there anything you would like to tell me about yourself or your case?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, the reason I don\u2019t have no attorney is because I\u2014\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m not interested.\nDefendant admitted to the probation violation and was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment by the trial court. Defendant appeals.\nII. Defendant\u2019s Right to Counsel\nDefendant contends that the trial court erred in allowing him to proceed without counsel as he had not waived counsel entirely but had waived only assigned counsel. We review this issue de novo. State v. Watlington,_N.C. App._,_, 716 S.E.2d 671, 675 (2011).\nThe State directs this Court\u2019s attention to State v. Warren, 82 N.C. App. 84, 345 S.E.2d 437 (1986), arguing that in Warren the defendant was not entitled to a new probation revocation hearing where \u201c[t]he defendant... signed ... a waiver, the trial court certified that defendant had been advised per G.S. Sec. 1242, and there is no record to support defendant\u2019s contention that the waiver of counsel was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary.\u201d Id. at 89, 345 S.E.2d at 441. However, we find this case distinguishable because in Warren the defendant indicated that he planned to represent himself and was waiving his right to all counsel; id. at 87, 345 S.E.2d at 440, here, both on defendant\u2019s waiver form and before the trial court defendant consistently maintained that he intended to hire an attorney, and he did not intend to proceed pro se. Thus, we find this case to be more in line with State v. McCrowre, 312 N.C. 478, 322 S.E.2d 775 (1984).\nIn McCrowre, at his arraignment, the defendant signed a waiver of assigned counsel stating that he planned to hire counsel. Id. at 479, 322 S.E.2d at 776. When defendant\u2019s case was called for trial, 13 days later, defendant asked for a continuance stating that he was going to hire an attorney. Id. at 479-80, 322 S.E.2d at 776. The trial court con tinued the case. Id. at 480, 322 S.E.2d at 776. A week later, defendant again appeared before the trial court without an attorney. Id. The defendant twice requested the assistance of counsel which the trial court denied because the defendant had waived his right to appointed counsel. Id. Our Supreme Court stated,\nThe record clearly indicates that when defendant signed the waiver of his right to assigned counsel, he did so with the expectation of being able to privately retain counsel. Before Judge Battle, the defendant stated that he wanted to discharge Mr. Britt, his assigned counsel, and employ his own lawyer. There is no evidence that defendant ever intended to proceed to trial without the assistance of some counsel.\nStatements of a desire not to be represented by court-appointed counsel do not amount to expressions of an intention to represent oneself. At most, defendant\u2019s statements amounted to an expression of the desire that his court-appointed lawyers be replaced. Given the fundamental nature of the right to counsel, we ought not to indulge in the presumption that it has been waived by anything less than an express indication of such an intention.\nThe waiver of counsel, like the waiver of all constitutional rights, must be knowing and voluntary, and the record must show that the defendant was literate and competent, that he understood the consequences of his waiver, and that, in waiving his right, he was voluntarily exercising his own free will.\nThe trial judge mistakenly believed that defendant had waived his right to all counsel at arraignment.\nHad defendant clearly indicated that he wished to proceed pro se, the trial court was required to make inquiry to determine whether defendant:\n(1) Has been clearly advised of his right to the assistance of counsel, including his right to the assignment of counsel when he is so entitled;\n(2) Understands and appreciates the consequences of this decision; and\n(3) Comprehends the nature of the charges and proceedings and the range of permissible punishments.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1242 (1983).- Such was not done in the present case and it was therefore error to permit defendant to go to trial without the assistance of counsel. For this reason, defendant is entitled to a new trial.\nId. at 480-81, 322 S.E.2d at 776-77 (emphasis added) (citations, ellipses, and brackets omitted); see also State v. Proby, 168 N.C. App. 724, 726, 608 S.E.2d 793, 794 (2005) (\u201cBefore a defendant in a probation revocation is allowed to represent himself, the court must comply with the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1242[.]\u201d)\nHere, just as in McCrowre, defendant initially waived only his right to appointed counsel with the intent of hiring his own attorney. See McCrowre, 312 N.C. at 479, 322 S.E.2d at 776. The trial court also seems to have been under the mistaken belief that defendant had waived his right to all counsel as the State told the trial court that defendant had \u201cwaived counsel[,]\u201d and when directed by the trial court to begin only if counsel had been waived, the State began discussing the merits of the hearing. See id. at 481, 322 S.E.2d at 777. As the trial court did not conduct the inquiry as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1242, to ensure that defendant wanted to proceed pro se, we must reverse and remand for a new hearing. See id.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for a new hearing.\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\nJudges HUNTER, Robert C. and ERVIN concur.", "author": "STROUD, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for the offense of first-degree murder and, for the remaining offenses, a consecutive active sentence of twenty-five to thirty-nine months. This Court heard defendant\u2019s appeal from those convictions on 6 December 2006. In State v. Hewson, 182 N.C. App. 196, 642 S.E.2d 459 (2007), this Court found no error and, in the recitation of facts, noted that \u201c[o]n the first-degree murder charge, the jury returned a guilty verdict based upon malice, premeditation, and deliberation, and based upon felony murder, with the underlying felony being discharging a weapon into occupied property.\u201d Id. at 200, 642 S.E.2d at 463.\nOn 16 September 2010, defendant, acting pro se, filed a \u201cMotion for Employment of Funds: Seeking Post D.N.A. Measurements and Independent Analysis\u201d in New Hanover County Superior Court. In recounting the procedural history, defendant noted that \u201c[a]s routine homicide investigations are evaluated, several items of potential evidence were seized by the Wilmington Police Department for such person to test items for incriminating and exculpatory matter.\u201d As a basis for his motion for DNA analysis, defendant states that \u201c[ijtems of D.N.A. testing have went [sic] untested for gunshot residue; and others have been tested, but an independent forensic testing would hold a reasonable probability of contradicting the prior test results of the S.B.I. laboratory.\u201d\nOn 13 October 2010, the Superior Court issued an order requiring that the New Hanover County Public Defender\u2019s Office be appointed to represent defendant on his motion.\nOn 15 November 2010, defendant filed an Amended Motion for Post-Conviction Independent Testing of DNA and Other Evidence. Defendant alleged the following:\n3. It is alleged on information and belief that there was DNA evidence obtained during the investigation of this case. Said DNA was obtained from the clothing of the [defendant] and from the window sill [sic] and other areas of the crime scene, from the victim and from the [defendant]. Further, blood was noted on the Smith and Wesson 38 caliber revolver found at the crime scene.\n4. Significant advances have been made in the science of DNA testing. . . .\n5. Recent revelations regarding malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance in the S.B.I. serology section has led to an investigation to review SBI crime lab practices ....\n7. The DNA evidence sought to be independently tested is material to the [defendant\u2019s] defense and is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the verdict and judgment in this case.\nTHEREFORE, based on the foregoing, the [defendant] requests the following:\n1. That the State be ordered to produce the dna [sic] material gathered in this case and have it re-tested by an independent laboratory.\nOn 12 April 2011, defendant filed a \u201cSummary of Evidence for Motion for Post-Conviction Independent Testing of DNA and Other Evidence,\u201d wherein defendant stated the following:\n1. At trial, DNA evidence was used to support the State\u2019s theory that the [defendant] was not inside the victim\u2019s house at the time, or immediately before, the victim died of gunshot wounds and to connect the [defendant] to the gun.\n3. The results of the DNA testing were used to link the [defendant] to the gun and to support the State\u2019s theory that the [defendant] was at all times outside the victim\u2019s house, never shooting from inside the house, and that the victim was the only person inside the house.\n4. The [defendant] was convicted of first degree murder on the basis of malice, premeditation and deliberation, as well as under the felony murder rule. The predicate felony under the felony murder rule was discharging a firearm into occupied property.\n5. Whether or not the [defendant] was in the house immediately before the victim\u2019s death is relevant under both first degree murder theories. The [defendant] could not be guilty of the predicate felony of shooting into occupied property if he was inside the property himself. Similarly, the [defendant\u2019s] presence outside the home was the basis for the State\u2019s theory that the [defendant] acted in a premeditated and deliberate way.\nA hearing on defendant\u2019s motion was held on 11 May 2011. During the hearing, defendant signed an Affidavit Supporting the Motion for Post-Conviction Independent Testing of DNA and Other Evidence. In his motion, defendant makes the following averments:\n1. That I was convicted of first degree murder based on felony murder and premeditation and deliberation;\n2. That I am actually innocent of first degree murder because:\na.' I did not premeditate and deliberate, and form a specific intent to kill Gail lice [Hewson];\nb. I did not shoot do not recall whether or not I shot into an occupied dwelling.\n3. I am actually innocent of first degree murder and therefore entitled to relief under N.C.G.S.15A-269.\n(Edits included in the original document).\nOn 15 July 2011, the trial court entered an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for post-conviction independent DNA testing. The court made the following findings of fact:\n1. The affidavit presented to the Court is insufficient, specifically the part of the affidavit in which the Defendant says that, \u201cI do not recall whether or not I shot into an occupied dwelling.\u201d\n2. DNA testing is not material to the Defendant\u2019s defense inasmuch as he was convicted under both theories of first degree murder, premeditation and deliberation as well as felony murder.\nTherefore, the Court concludes that the Defendant has not met the requirements set out in N.C.G.S.15A-269.\nDefendant gave notice of appeal following the trial court\u2019s oral rendering of its judgment at the conclusion of the hearing.\nOn appeal, defendant raises the following issues: Whether the trial court erred (I) in finding that the affidavit was insufficient under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-269; (II) in finding that DNA testing was not material to defendant\u2019s defense; and (III) in concluding that defendant had not met the requirements for requesting post-conviction DNA testing pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-269.\nGrounds for Appeal\nWe note that pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes, section 15A-270.1, \u201c[a] defendant may appeal an order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for DNA testing under this Article, including by an interlocutory appeal.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-270.1 (2011); see also State v. Norman, 202 N.C. App. 329, 688 S.E.2d 512 (2010).\nIssue\nWe first address argument II.\nII\nDefendant argues that the trial court erred in finding as fact that DNA testing was not material to defendant\u2019s defense. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder on the basis of both premeditation and deliberation and felony-murder predicated upon discharge of a weapon into occupied property. Defendant contends that the State\u2019s theory of the case, presented during his trial in 2005, indicated that the victim was always inside the home and defendant was always outside the home while discharging his handgun into the residence. Defendant notes that evidence collected during the police investiga tion of the murder showed that blood was found on defendant\u2019s pants, and that the blood was never tested for identification pur-, poses. Defendant contends that if DNA evidence indicates the blood on defendant\u2019s pants belonged to the victim, defendant could argue that he was in close proximity to the victim; that he was not shooting at her from outside of the residence; and that he would have the basis for a heat-of-passion defense to first-degree murder based on premeditation and deliberation with a potential reduction in charge to second-degree murder. We disagree.\nIn making a request for post-conviction DNA testing pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes, section 15A-269,\n(a) [a] defendant may make a motion before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction against the defendant for performance of DNA testing ... if the biological evidence meets all of the following conditions:\n(1) Is material to the defendant\u2019s defense.\n(2) Is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment.\n(3) Meets either of the following conditions:\na. It was not DNA tested previously.\nb. It was tested previously, but the requested DNA test would provide results that are significantly more accurate and probative of the identity of the perpetrator or accomplice or have a reasonable probability of contradicting prior test results.\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-269(a) (2011) (emphasis added). \u201cFavorable evidence is material if there is a \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that its disclosure to the defense would result in a different outcome in the jury\u2019s deliberation.\u201d State v. Canady, 355 N.C. 242, 252, 559 S.E.2d 762, 767 (2002) (quoting State v. Strickland, 346 N.C. 443, 456, 488 S.E.2d 194, 202 (1997)) (emphasis added).\nIn his amended motion for post-conviction testing of DNA evidence, defendant acknowledged that during his criminal trial, evidence was presented that bullets remaining in the gun found outside the victim\u2019s residence matched bullets taken from the victim\u2019s body.\nDuring the 11 May 2011 hearing on defendant\u2019s amended motion for post-conviction independent testing of DNA evidence, the State further described the evidence presented at trial: defendant threatened and assaulted the victim; in the days leading up to her death, the victim took out a 50B domestic violence protection order that was served on defendant; in the week leading up to the shooting, defendant was barred from purchasing a handgun from a local business due to the 50B protection order; the victim turned in weapons in her custody to a sheriff; the victim\u2019s 9-1-1 call, recorded the day of her shooting and played for the jury, included the victim\u2019s statements that her husband], defendant,] was shooting at her; all shell casings were found outside the residence; the trajectory of the bullets suggested that the bullets were fired into the residence from outside; the gun used to shoot the victim had be reloaded to continue shooting; and, after placing defendant under arrest at the scene, law enforcement had to break in the door to enter the residence and aid the victim.\nAlso, in support of his motion for employment of funds seeking post-conviction DNA testing, defendant attached a search warrant that was issued in connection with the murder investigation of his wife. The affiant in support of the search warrant stated the following:\nOn 9-29-04, the New Hanover County 911 Center received a phone call from a female calling from 1721 Fontenay Place. The female caller did not identify herself but stated that she had been shot and that her husband keeps shooting her. Officer A.C. Anderson was the first officer on the scene. Upon Officer Anderson\u2019s arrival, she observed the defendant, Mr. Robert Hewson, standing outside of the residence with his hands in the air. Mr. Hewson was handcuffed and detained, and according to Officer Anderson, the only statement that he made was that he had not been inside of the house. However, Officer Anderson observed blood stains on Mr. Hewson\u2019s pants. Officer K. Tully and M. Lewis entered the residence and located the victim, Mrs. Gail Hewson, lying on the floor of a lounge type room. Gail Hewson appeared to have been shot multiple times.\nAccording to Det. Benton, upon a preliminary inspection of the residence, broken glass was observed on the living room couch and there were bullet holes in the window directly behind the couch, indicating that the shooter was outside shooting into the residence. There was also a blood trail that led from the living room, down a hallway, and into the room where Gail Hewson was located by Officer Tully and Lewis. Four bullet holes were also observed in the windows of the room where Gail Hewson was located. Additionally, Det. Benton noted that spent shell casings were located outside of the residence, as well as in the room w[h]ere Gail Hewson was found, and black revolver [sic] was located outside on the front porch of the residence.\nWe find that the evidence submitted by defendant in support of his motion supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on the charge of first-degree murder based on premeditation and deliberation and based on the felony-murder rule, and does not support a jury instruction on the heat-of-passion defense. Defendant\u2019s contention that he was in close proximity to the victim at some point, even if supported by DNA evidence, does not minimize the significance of or otherwise refute the substantial evidence that defendant fired a gun into occupied property and that the victim suffered fatal gunshot wounds as a result. Based on this record, there is no reasonable probability that the disclosure of DNA evidence in support of defendant\u2019s contention would result in a different outcome in a jury\u2019s deliberation. See id. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that DNA testing was not material to defendant\u2019s defense and, consequently, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s motion failed to meet the criteria for a request for post-conviction DNA testing pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a715A-269(a)(l).\nFurther, because we hold that the trial court had sufficient basis to determine that post-conviction independent DNA testing was not material to defendant\u2019s defense and, thus, had grounds to deny defendant\u2019s motion for post-conviction DNA testing made pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-269(a), we need not address defendant\u2019s remaining arguments.\nAffirmed.\nJudges ELMORE and ERVIN concur.", "author": "BRYANT, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

The State dismissed the charge of obtaining property by false pretenses prior to trial. This case came on for trial during the 10 August 2010 Criminal Session of Wayne County Superior Court.\nAt trial, evidence was presented that in February 2007, defendant was stationed at Camp Lejeune in Onslow County and assigned to the Separations Section, 2d Marine Logistics Group. There, defendant assumed the position of staff Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC). The duties of the NCOIC included supervising the marines in the unit, including Lance Corporal Maria Lauterbach. Following a series of disciplinary infractions by Lance Cpl. Lauterbach, the Officer in Charge (OIC), Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Caroline Bier, instructed defendant to counsel Lauterbach.\nIn May 2007, Lance Cpl. Lauterbach accused defendant of a sexual assault that she alleged had occurred six weeks earlier. Defendant denied the allegation and an investigation ensued. Lauterbach was transferred to another section at Camp Lejeune, and a military protective order was issued commanding the separation of Lance Cpl. Lauterbach and defendant. Despite the order barring contact between the two, defendant and Lance Cpl. Lauterbach were seen together on multiple occasions, such as, in the giftware department of the Base Exchange and at a local dry cleaner. In June 2007, Lance Cpl. Lauterbach learned that she was pregnant. She claimed the pregnancy was the result of the sexual assault.\nOn Friday, 14 December 2007, Lance Cpl. Lauterbach worked at. her unit from 7:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. At 4:30 p.m., her roommate found a note stating \u201cSorry, but I cannot take this Marine Corps life anymore, so I am going away. Sorry for the inconvenience. Maria.\u201d The note was turned over to a warrant officer in Lauterbach\u2019s section. Lauterbach\u2019s mother filed a missing person\u2019s report.\nDuring the investigation into her disappearance, it was determined that on 14 December 2007, Lance Cpl. Lauterbach withdrew $700.00 from her bank account via an ATM machine and, at 5:00 p.m. that day, purchased a bus ticket for travel the next day from Jacksonville, North Carolina to El Paso, Texas. The ticket agent at the bus station was the last person to acknowledge seeing Lance Cpl. Lauterbach alive.\nOn 16 December 2007, defendant purchased supplies to build a fire pit in his back yard. Defendant\u2019s neighbors later testified that around the holidays in December 2007, defendant had a bonfire in his backyard \u2014 an event that had not previously occurred. On 20 December, Lauterbach\u2019s cell phone was found near the entrance to Camp Lejeune. On 24 December, a man who attempted to obscure his face from the video camera at an ATM but resembled defendant, used Lauterbach\u2019s debit card to access her bank account in an attempt to withdraw funds.\nOn 8 January 2008, defendant was interviewed about the disappearance of Lance Cpl. Lauterbach by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Following the interview, defendant asked what would happen to the investigation involving Lauterbach\u2019s accusations of sexual assault against him if she did not come back. On 11 January 2008, defendant did not report for work.\nOn 11 and 12 January 2008, investigators searched defendant\u2019s home pursuant to a search warrant. Blood stains later determined to contain the DNA of Lance Cpl. Lauterbach were found on numerous items in the garage. Lauterbach\u2019s body and that of her fetus were found burned and buried in the fire pit in defendant\u2019s back yard. A search of defendant\u2019s computer revealed that on 8 January at 11:30 a.m., defendant performed a computer search of Puerto Vallar\u00eda, Mexico.\nDefendant had fled in early January but was apprehended near San Juan de la Vina, a small town located in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, on 10 April 2008. Defendant was extradited back to the United States to stand trial. Due to pretrial publicity, a change of venue was granted. The case moved from Onslow County to Wayne County, and defendant received a trial by jury in Wayne County Superior Court.\nDefendant was convicted of first-degree murder, financial transaction card theft, and attempted financial transaction card fraud. Defendant was found not guilty of robbery with a dangerous weapon. Judgment on all offenses was consolidated, and defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Defendant appeals.\nOn appeal, defendant raises the following questions: did the trial court err (I) by failing to submit the lesser-included-offense of second-degree murder to the jury; and (II) by excluding evidence of the victim\u2019s behavior.\n/\nDefendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder. Defendant acknowledges that the evidence presented was sufficient to support an instruction on first-degree murder, necessarily acknow \u00a1edging support for a finding of premeditation and deliberation. However, defendant points out that there was no evidence presented to illustrate the circumstances leading up to the infliction of the fatal injury. On this basis, defendant contends that the jury should have been allowed to consider whether defendant formed the intent to kill without premeditation and deliberation, and, thus, the trial court erred in denying his request for an instruction on second-degree murder. We disagree.\nWe review the trial court\u2019s denial of the request for an instruction on the lesser included offense de novo. E.g. State v. Ligon, 332 N.C. 224, 240-41, 420 S.E.2d 136, 145-46 (1992); State v. Dyson, 165 N.C. App. 648, 653-55, 599 S.E.2d 73, 77 (2004) (de novo review of whether a trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request for a lesser included offense instruction was proper).\n\u201cIt is an elementary rule of law that a trial judge is required to declare and explain the law arising on the evidence and to instruct according to the evidence.\u201d State v. Strickland, 307 N.C. 274, 284, 298 S.E.2d 645, 652 (1983), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Johnson, 317 N.C. 193, 344 S.E.2d 775 (1986). \u201c[D]ue process requires an instruction on a lesser-included offense only \u2018if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find [the defendant] guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater.\u2019 \u201d State v. Conaway, 339 N.C. 487, 514, 453 S.E.2d 824, 841 (1995) (citing Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 635, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392, 401 (1980) (holding that \u201cif the unavailability of a lesser included offense instruction enhances the risk of an unwarranted conviction, [the court] is constitutionally prohibited from withdrawing that option from the jury . . . .\u201d Beck, 447 U.S. at 638, 65 L. Ed. 2d at 403)). However, \u201c[t]he trial court should refrain from \u2018indiscriminately or automatically\u2019 instructing on lesser included offenses. Such restraint ensures that the jury\u2019s discretion is . . . channelled [sic] so that it may convict a defendant of only those crimes fairly supported by the evidence.\u201d State v. Taylor, 362 N.C. 514, 530, 669 S.E.2d 239, 256 (2008) (citations, quotations, and brackets omitted).\n\u201cWhere the State\u2019s evidence is positive as to each element of the offense charged and there is no contradictory evidence relating to any element, no instruction on a lesser included offense is required.\u201d State v. Millsaps, 356 N.C. 556, 562, 572 S.E.2d 767, 772 (2002) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c \u2018a defendant is not entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense merely because the jury could possibly believe some of the State\u2019s evidence but not all of it.\u2019 \u201d Taylor, 362 N.C. at 533, 669 S.E.2d at 257 (quoting State v. Annadale, 329 N.C. 557, 568, 406 S.E.2d 837, 844 (1991)).\nFirst-degree murder is, inter alia, the unlawful killing of a human being committed with malice, premeditation, and deliberation. \u201cThe unlawful killing of a human being with malice but without premeditation and deliberation is murder in the second degree.\u201d\nState v. Bedford,__ N.C. App._, _, 702 S.E.2d 522, 526-27 (2010) (quoting State v. Geddie, 345 N.C. 73, 94, 478 S.E.2d 146, 156 (1996)) (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-17 (2009)).\nThe well-established rule for submission of second-degree murder as a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder is: \u201cIf the evidence is sufficient to fully satisfy the State\u2019s burden of proving each and every element of the offense of murder in the first degree . . . and there is no evidence to negate these elements other than [the] defendant\u2019s denial that he committed the offense, the trial judge should properly exclude from jury consideration the possibility of a conviction of second degree murder.\u201d\nState v. Locklear, 363 N.C. 438, 454-55, 681 S.E.2d 293, 306 (2009) (quoting Strickland, 307 N.C. at 293, 298 S.E.2d at 658).\nHere, the evidence presented illustrates that Lance Cpl. Lauterbach made a formal accusation of rape on 11 May 2007. She also maintained that the assault resulted in her pregnancy. An Article 32 hearing to present the findings of an investigation to a military court and determine whether to proceed to a general court martial was scheduled to be held in December 2007 or January 2008.\nIt is clear from the evidence that defendant was very concerned about the sexual assault allegation, the pregnancy, and the investigation. Lance Cpl. Blake Costa testified that defendant admitted to a sexual encounter with Lance Cpl. Lauterbach \u2014 though he described it as consensual \u2014 and acknowledged that the situation was temporarily affecting his career. Costa testified that defendant asked him to help defendant make contact with Lauterbach. Defendant stated that he wanted Lauterbach to move to Mexico, the purpose for which was to discredit her as a deserter and help salvage his military career.\nOn 14 December 2007, Lance Cpl. Lauterbach withdrew $700.00 from her bank account and purchased a bus ticket to El Paso, Texas. Shortly thereafter, she disappeared. At some point in December 2007, a blue Hyundai, had been observed parked at defendant\u2019s house. On 7 January 2008, Lance Cpl. Lauterbach\u2019s blue Hyundai was found at the Jacksonville bus station. Law enforcement was unable to retrieve identifiable prints from the vehicle.\nIn early January, following an interview with naval investigators in the investigation of Lance Cpl. Lauterbach\u2019s disappearance, defendant inquired as to how Lauterbach\u2019s disappearance would affect the investigation into her allegations against him. Shortly thereafter, defendant fled. On 11 and 12 January 2008, investigators searched defendant\u2019s home. Blood stains were found in the garage, specifically, on a black storage container, a paint can, a pink plastic swim raft, tan pillow case, painting equipment, a pegboard on the garage wall, a white plastic bag, an infant swing, a box, the garage wall, the ceiling, and the garage floor. These blood stains contained Lance Cpl. Lauterbach\u2019s DNA. In the back yard, Lauterbach\u2019s body and that of her fetus were found in the charred earth of defendant\u2019s firepit. Defendant\u2019s neighbors testified that around the holidays in December 2007, defendant had a bonfire in his back yard \u2014 the first and only time that such an event had ever occurred there.\nOn appeal, defendant concedes that the evidence presented warranted an instruction on the charge of first-degree murder, necessarily acknowledging support for findings of premeditation and deliberation. However, defendant asserts that because the evidence failed to illustrate the circumstances immediately preceding Lance Cpl. Lauterbach\u2019s murder, the jury should have been allowed to consider that he formed the intent to kill absent premeditation and deliberation and, therefore, was entitled to an instruction on second-degree murder. Defendant asserts that an absence of evidence (the failure to illustrate the exact circumstances surrounding the murder) entitles him to a jury instruction on second-degree murder, while simultaneously acknowledging the sufficiency of the evidence to support an instruction on first-degree murder. Defendant\u2019s assertions must fail.\nOn the evidence presented, an instruction by the trial court on the charge of second-degree murder would be, defendant must concede, an instruction for which no evidence was presented in support thereof. An instruction on the charge of second-degree murder requires that the unlawful killing of a human being occur without pre meditation and deliberation. See Bedford,_N.C. App. at_, 702 S.E.2d at 526-27 (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-17 (2009). Defendant fails to direct this Court\u2019s attention to any evidence that Lance Cpl. Lauterbach was killed without premeditation and deliberation. See Locklear, 363 N.C. 454-55, 681 S.E.2d at 306 (\u201c \u2018If the evidence is sufficient to fully satisfy the State\u2019s burden of proving each and every element of the offense of murder in the first degree . . . and there is no evidence to negate these elements other than defendant\u2019s denial that he committed the offense, the trial judge should properly exclude from jury consideration the possibility of a conviction of second degree murder.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Strickland, 307 N.C. at 293, 298 S.E.2d at 658)). Defendant does not deny that he committed a homicide, he simply challenges what he refers to as a lack of evidence of premeditation and deliberation. However, the facts in this case fully support a jury verdict of first-degree murder. See State v. Moses, 350 N.C. 741, 775, 517 S.E.2d 853, 874 (1999) (Our Supreme Court \u201chas stated \u2018the finding of premeditation and deliberation indicates a more coldblooded and calculated crime.\u2019 \u201d (quoting State v. Artis, 325 N.C. 278, 341, 384 S.E.2d 470, 506 (1989), sentence vacated on other grounds, 494 U.S. 1023, 108 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1990)). Accordingly, we overrule defendant\u2019s argument.\nII\nNext, defendant argues that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of specific instances of conduct by Lance Cpl. Lauterbach that led to defendant imposing military discipline on her immediately prior to her accusation of rape. Defendant argues that such evidence established that Lauterbach had a motive to falsely accuse defendant of rape and was admissible under Rule of Evidence 404(b). We disagree.\n\u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by the Constitution of North Carolina, by Act of Congress, by Act of the General Assembly or by these rules. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 402 (2011). \u201cA trial court\u2019s rulings on relevancy are technically not discretionary, though we accord them great deference on appeal.\u201d State v. Lane, 365 N.C. 7, 27, 707 S.E.2d 210, 223 (2011) (citing State v. Wallace, 104 N.C. App. 498, 502, 410 S.E.2d 226, 228 (1991); also State v. Lawrence, 352 N.C. 1, 17-18, 530 S.E.2d 807, 817-18 (2000) (reviewing trial court\u2019s exclusion of expert witness testimony on behalf of defendant for error and finding none)).\n\u201c \u2018In a criminal case every circumstance calculated to throw any light upon the supposed crime is admissible and permissible.\u2019 \u201d State v. Grant, 178 N.C. App. 565, 573, 632 S.E.2d 258, 265 (2006) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Bruton, 344 N.C. 381, 386, 474 S.E.2d 336, 340 (1996)). However, under Rule of Evidence 404(b),\n[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake, entrapment or accident.\nN.C. R. Evid. 404(b) (2011).\nTo be admissible under Rule 404(b), evidence of a prior crime or incident must be sufficiently similar to the incident at issue. State v. Boyd, 321 N.C. 574, 364 S.E.2d 118 (1988). Even if evidence is sufficiently similar to be admissible under Rule 404(b), it is nevertheless subject to the relevancy requirements and balancing test of Rule 403. State v. Thibodeaux, 352 N.C. 570, 532 S.E.2d 797 (2000) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1155, 148 L. Ed. 2d 976 (2001).\nState v. Nance, 157 N.C. App. 434, 438, 579 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2003).\nHere, defendant was indicted on charges of first-degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, attempted misdemeanor financial transaction card fraud, obtaining property by false pretenses, and financial transaction card theft stemming from the murder of Lance Cpl. Lauterbach and the use of her debit card in an attempt to withdraw funds from her bank account.\nAt trial, defendant sought to question CWO Bier and the OIC of the legal division, CWO Joel Larsen, about Lance Cpl. Lauterbach\u2019s disciplinary infractions which led to CWO Bier\u2019s request that defendant counsel Lauterbach. Defendant argued that this information was relevant because it established Lauterbach\u2019s motive for making a false allegation of rape against him. In a hearing outside of the jury\u2019s presence, the trial court expressed concern that the jury could reasonably be left with the uncontested assertion that defendant raped Lauterbach. The trial court ruled that defendant would be allowed to question CWO Larsen regarding Lauterbach\u2019s reputation of truthfulness, including the allegation of rape but, because the character trait was not an essential element of a charge or defense, sustained the State\u2019s objections as to specific instances of conduct leading to disciplinary infractions. The court further instructed CWO Bier, before her testimony, that while she was allowed to disclose the fact that Lauterbach received counseling, she was not to disclose the basis for such counseling.\nWe agree the question of whether Lance Cpl. Lauterbach\u2019s accusation of rape was grounded in fact or falsehood was not before the jury. Moreover, Lauterbach\u2019s specific instances of conduct unrelated to defendant shed no light upon the crimes for which defendant was charged. See Grant, 178 N.C. App. at 573, 632 S.E.2d at 265. Therefore, the specific instances of conduct for which Lance Cpl. Lauterbach received minor disciplinary infractions were not relevant to the issues presented to the jury and were properly excluded from evidence presented at trial.\nAccordingly, defendant\u2019s argument is overruled.\nNo error.\nJudges CALABRIA and STROUD concur.", "author": "BRYANT, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-16.3A (2011). Under White v. Tippett, 187 N.C. App. 285, 652 S.E.2d 728 (2007), however, because defendant did not actually stop at the checkpoint, its invalidity was immaterial to whether an officer had sufficient reasonable suspicion when stopping defendant once defendant drove into a residential driveway to avoid the checkpoint. We, therefore, vacate the order granting the motion to suppress and remand for further findings of fact and conclusions of law on the constitutionality of the stop of defendant.\nFacts\nThe evidence presented by the State at the motion to suppress hearing tended to show the following. On 3 September 2008, Troopers Jeff Hammonds and Scott Floyd of the N.C. State Highway Patrol set up a checkpoint to check for individuals driving with revoked driver\u2019s licenses. They had verbal permission from their supervisor as to the pattern of checking and the location.\nAt approximately 3:15 p.m., defendant was driving west toward the checkpoint. About a hundred yards before the checkpoint, defendant turned left into a residential driveway. Trooper Hammonds left the checkpoint and parked behind defendant in the driveway, with lights still flashing. Trooper Hammonds followed defendant because Trooper Hammonds knew the people who lived at the residence, and defendant did not live there.\nDefendant was knocking on the door when Trooper Hammonds rolled his window down and asked defendant what he was doing. Defendant said that he had heard somebody in the area was hiring, and he was trying to see if the residents of the house had a job for him. Defendant was on the porch during this conversation, standing a distance of about 50 feet from Trooper Hammonds, but then came off the porch and walked toward the trooper.\nWhen defendant got close to Trooper Hammonds, the trooper smelled a moderate odor of alcohol and noticed that defendant had red, glassy eyes. Trooper Hammonds asked defendant if he had a driver\u2019s license, and defendant answered affirmatively. When defendant could not produce his driver\u2019s license, he gave the trooper his son\u2019s driver\u2019s license, a credit card, a social security card, and a military ID. Defendant told Trooper Hammonds that he must have left his driver\u2019s license at home.\nAt that point, Trooper Hammonds asked defendant if he had been drinking and where he had been drinking. Defendant answered that he had been drinking earlier that day. Trooper Hammonds then asked defendant to come back to the highway patrol vehicle so that Trooper Hammonds could give him a road side test. The record does not clearly indicate what happened after that request although defendant was, that same day, arrested and charged with driving while impaired (\u201cDWI\u201d) and driving with a revoked license.\nDefendant was initially tried in district court where he moved to suppress all evidence obtained when defendant was stopped without reasonable articulable suspicion. Defendant further contended that the checkpoint was unconstitutional and violated policy and procedures of the N.C. State Highway Patrol. The district court denied his motion to suppress and found defendant guilty of DWI and driving with a revoked license.\nOn appeal to superior court, defendant renewed his motion to suppress. At the hearing on the motion, Trooper Hammonds was the only witness to testify. Defendant presented no evidence. Following the hearing, the trial court entered an order finding, as pertinent to this appeal, that Troopers Hammonds and Floyd obtained only oral permission to set up a driver\u2019s license checking station even though the Highway Patrol had a written policy adopted pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-16.3A that mandated written approval prior to establishing a checkpoint. Based on those findings, the trial court concluded that the checking station \u201cwas in violation of the Highway Patrol\u2019s written guidelines in that it was conducted without written authorization\u201d and that a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-16.3A was grounds for a motion to suppress.\nThe trial court then concluded that all evidence obtained as a result of the invalid checking station must be excluded. It found that \u201cTrooper Hammond\u2019s attention was drawn to the defendant as a result of Defendant turning left prior to reaching the unauthorized checking station. This led to the Trooper\u2019s belief and suspicion that Defendant turned left to avoid the unauthorized checking station.\u201d It then concluded that the \u201cactions taken to avoid an unlawful checking station could not lawfully constitute reasonable suspicion to stop defendant or probable cause for any arrest.\u201d\nBased on these conclusions, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. On or about 6 December 2010, the State filed a certification pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-979(c) (2009) that \u201cthe appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and that the evidence is essential to the case.\u201d The State timely appealed to this Court.\nDiscussion\nOur review of a trial court\u2019s order on a motion to suppress \u201cis strictly limited to determining whether the trial judge\u2019s underlying findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, in which event they are conclusively binding on appeal, and whether those factual findings in turn support the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions of law.\u201d State v. Cooke, 306 N.C. 132, 134, 291 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1982). Findings of fact not challenged on appeal are binding on this Court. State v. Brown, 199 N.C. App. 253, 256, 681 S.E.2d 460, 463 (2009). On the other hand, the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law \u201cmust be legally correct, reflecting a correct application of applicable legal principles to the facts found.\u201d State v. Fernandez, 346 N.C. 1, 11, 484 S.E.2d 350, 357 (1997).\nIn this case, the State contends that the trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress because the validity or invalidity of the driver\u2019s license checkpoint was immaterial since defendant was not stopped at the checkpoint, but rather was stopped at a residential location before he ever got to the checkpoint. The State contends that this Court\u2019s decision in White v. Tippett, 187 N.C. App. 285, 652 S.E.2d 728 (2007), is controlling.\nIn White, the petitioner challenged the suspension of her driving privileges by the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles due to her willful refusal to submit to an intoxilizer test. Id. at 286, 652 S.E.2d at 729. The petitioner had stopped at a checkpoint, but, before an officer could speak with her, drove off. Id. at 287, 652 S.E.2d at 729. An officer followed her and, when she exited her vehicle, found her to have a smell of alcohol and red, glassy eyes. Id. The petitioner was arrested when she registered a 0.10 on two Alcosenser tests and willfully refused to take an intoxilizer test. Id.\nThe petitioner made two arguments to the superior court: \u201cFirst, that the checkpoint was unconstitutional, and second, that the officer lacked reasonable grounds to believe she had committed the offense for which she was arrested.\u201d Id. at 288, 652 S.E.2d at 729. The Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s first argument, holding that \u201cthe constitutionality of certain types of checkpoints . . . applies only where the petitioner or defendant has in fact been stopped at a checkpoint. Here, petitioner was not stopped at the checkpoint . . . .\u201d Id., 652 S.E.2d at 730.\nThe Court observed that \u201c[w]hile the validity of the checkpoint is not at issue here, petitioner\u2019s avoidance of the checkpoint is relevant to her next argument\u201d that the officer lacked reasonable grounds to believe she had committed the offense for which she was arrested. Id. The Court concluded as to this second issue:\n[A]n officer pursued a person who had evaded\u2014intentionally or by accident\u2014a checkpoint and come to a stop in a residential driveway. The officer then approached the stopped car and spoke to the occupants. At that point, from a combination of the driver\u2019s evasion of a checkpoint, the odor of alcohol surrounding the driver, and a brief conversation with the driver, the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver had committed an implied-consent offense.\nId. at 289, 652 S.E.2d at 730.\nWe agree with the State that White is controlling. This Court squarely held that the validity of a checkpoint is not relevant in deciding whether an officer had reasonable grounds to stop a driver when the driver was not actually stopped at the allegedly invalid checkpoint. Since defendant, in this case, evaded the checkpoint, the trial court\u2019s determination that the invalidity of the checkpoint required exclusion of evidence obtained from the later stop cannot be reconciled with White. We must vacate the trial court\u2019s order.\nAlthough the trial court erred in its legal conclusion that the invalidity of the checkpoint ended the inquiry for purposes of the motion to suppress, the question remains whether Trooper Hammonds had a reasonable articulable suspicion to stop defendant at the residence. See id. (after concluding that the validity of the checkpoint was immaterial, holding that court still needed to address whether trooper had reasonable grounds to believe an implied consent offense had occurred).\nWhile the State contends that defendant\u2019s encounter with Trooper Hammonds was consensual, and defendant contends that Trooper Hammonds had no reasonable articulable suspicion before the investigatory stop occurred and, therefore, defendant was illegally seized, these arguments were not resolved by the trial court in its order. Although the trial court made findings of fact regarding what occurred after defendant turned into the residential driveway, those findings were made under the erroneous assumption that the invalidity of the checking station was dispositive of the motion to dismiss. It is well established that \u201c \u2018[f]acts found under misapprehension of the law will be set aside on the theory that the evidence should be considered in its true legal light.\u2019 \u201d Helms v. Rea, 282 N.C. 610, 620, 194 S.E.2d 1, 8 (1973) (quoting McGill v. Lumberton, 215 N.C. 752, 754, 3 S.E.2d 324, 326 (1939)).\nConsequently, we decline to address in the first instance whether Trooper Hammonds stopped defendant or had the necessary reasonable suspicion to stop defendant. Rather, we remand to the trial court for a determination whether defendant was unconstitutionally stopped at the residence. Depending on the facts that the trial court finds on remand, the court could determine that no unconstitutional stop occurred. See State v. Foreman, 351 N.C. 627, 632-33, 527 S.E.2d 921, 924 (2000); State v. Bowman, 193 N.C. App. 104, 107-08, 666 S.E.2d 831, 834 (2008). We, therefore, vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.\nReversed and remanded.\nJudges STEELMAN and BEASLEY concur.\n. As case law supports the proposition that defendant was not stopped at the checkpoint and, therefore, that the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the checkpoint is not an issue, we decline to address the State\u2019s contention that the violation of a state agency\u2019s internal guidelines was not a basis for granting a motion to suppress.", "author": "GEER, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.

On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress when, defendant argues, the police officer lacked a reasonable articulable suspicion to stop him. We hold that the order denying the motion to suppress was amply supported by the trial court\u2019s uncontested findings that defendant\u2019s weaving in his own lane was sufficiently frequent and erratic to prompt evasive maneuvers from other drivers. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying the motion to suppress.\nFacts\nAt the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and at trial, the State\u2019s evidence tended to show the following facts. On 8 May 2010, Deputy Sheriff Joshua Akers of the Sampson County Sheriff\u2019s Department observed a white Chevrolet Metro automobile with dim taillights while he was going to lock up the post office in Garland, North Carolina. He called Deputy Sheriff Austin Kelly Coleman and alerted him regarding the automobile.\nDeputy Coleman followed the car for three quarters of a mile to a mile and observed that the driver, subsequently identified as defendant, was driving erratically. Defendant was weaving within his lane of travel constantly and drove on the center line at least once. There was a high level of traffic that evening, and Deputy Coleman stopped defendant when he observed oncoming drivers pulling over to the side of the road in reaction to defendant\u2019s driving.\nIt was approximately 10:30 p.m. when Deputy Coleman pulled over defendant. When Deputy Coleman approached defendant\u2019s car, he smelled a strong odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle and from defendant\u2019s person.\nDeputy Coleman called Deputy Akers for backup. Deputy Akers, who believed defendant appeared intoxicated, obtained defendant\u2019s consent to search his vehicle. In the car, Deputy Akers found an open container of malt liquor as well as other alcohol. Deputy Akers then asked defendant and his passengers to get out of the car.\nAlthough defendant performed fairly on three field sobriety tests, Deputy Coleman formed the opinion that defendant had consumed enough alcohol so as to impair his physical and mental faculties. Deputy Coleman charged defendant with DWI and driving with his license revoked and transported defendant to the Sampson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. An intoxilyzer test was performed at 12:44 a.m., and defendant registered .13 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\nDefendant was indicted for driving with his license revoked and habitual DWI on 12 July 2010. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop in an order entered on or about 17 November 2010. The jury convicted defendant of DWI and driving with his license revoked, and defendant stipulated to three prior DWI convictions for purposes of the habitual DWI indictment. The trial court sentenced defendant to a presumptive-range term of 24 to 29 months imprisonment. Defendant timely appealed to this Court.\nDiscussion\nDefendant contends that Deputy Coleman lacked reasonable suspicion to justify his traffic stop of defendant and that the trial court, therefore, should have granted his motion to suppress. He further asserts that in the absence of the evidence obtained as a result of the stop, insufficient evidence existed to support his conviction, and the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\u201cThe scope of review of the denial of a motion to suppress is \u2018strictly limited to determining whether the trial judge\u2019s underlying findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, in which event they are conclusively binding on appeal, and whether those factual findings in turn support the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d State v. Bone, 354 N.C. 1, 7, 550 S.E.2d 482, 486 (2001) (quoting State v. Cooke, 306 N.C. 132, 134, 291 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1982)). The trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are fully reviewable on appeal. State v. Hughes, 353 N.C. 200, 208, 539 S.E.2d 625, 631 (2000).\nUnder the Fourth Amendment, a police officer is permitted to \u201cconduct a brief investigatory stop of a vehicle and detain its occupants without a warrant[.]\u201d State v. McArn, 159 N.C. App. 209, 212, 582 S.E.2d 371, 374 (2003). However, \u201cin order to conduct a warrant-less, investigatory stop, an officer must have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d Hughes, 353 N.C. at 206-07, 539 S.E.2d at 630. \u201cThe reasonable suspicion must arise from the officer\u2019s knowledge prior to the time of the stop.\u201d Id. at 208, 539 S.E.2d at 631.\nReasonable suspicion requires \u201ca minimal level of objective justification, something more than an \u2018unparticularized suspicion or hunch.\u2019 \u201d State v. Watkins, 337 N.C. 437, 442, 446 S.E.2d 67, 70 (1994) (quoting United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 10, 109 S. Ct. 1581, 1585 (1989)). \u201c[T]he overarching inquiry when assessing reasonable suspicion is always based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d State v. Maready, 362 N.C. 614, 619, 669 S.E.2d 564, 567 (2008).\nIn its order, the trial court made the following findings pertinent to whether Deputy Coleman had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant:\n4. Deputy Coleman thereafter encountered a white Chevrolet Metro operating on Garland Highway with dim tail lights.\n5. While following [defendant\u2019s] vehicle for three fourths of a mile to one mile, Deputy Coleman noticed the vehicle weaving erratically within its travel lane, weaving from the \u201cfog line\u201d to the center line several times.\n6. Deputy Coleman described the movements of the vehicle as \u201clike a ball bouncing in a small room.\u201d\n7. Deputy Coleman observed that traffic was heavy in the opposite direction of the followed vehicle due to traffic going to a popular local lake.\n8. Deputy Coleman became concerned that the driver\u2019s ability to control the vehicle was impaired.\n9. Deputy Coleman became concerned for the safety of the oncoming traffic traveling in the direction opposite that of the followed vehicle after observing oncoming traffic taking evasive action by moving to the far right.\nSince defendant does not challenge these findings of fact on appeal, they are \u201c \u2018presumed to be correct.\u2019 \u201d State v. Pickard, 178 N.C. App. 330, 334, 631 S.E.2d 203, 206 (2006) (quoting Inspirational Network, Inc. v. Combs, 131 N.C. App. 231, 235, 506 S.E.2d 754, 758 (1998)). Based on these findings of fact, the trial court concluded that \u201c [t]he weaving within the lane, it\u2019s character as \u2018bouncing\u2019, the dim lights, the evasive movements of the oncoming traffic when viewed through the eyes of a reasonable cautious officer, guided by his training and experience, taken in total provide at least a minimal level of objective justification for stopping the vehicle.\u201d The court, therefore, determined that Deputy Coleman had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle.\nDefendant contends that the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion. He argues that, at most, the court\u2019s findings establish that Deputy Coleman observed defendant weaving within his own lane of travel, which was insufficient to support the traffic stop.\nThis Court has previously held that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s weaving within his lane, standing alone, is insufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol.\u201d State v. Fields, 195 N.C. App. 740, 746, 673 S.E.2d 765, 769 (2009). In this case, however, the trial court did not find only that defendant was weaving in his lane, but rather that defendant\u2019s driving was \u201c \u2018like a ball bouncing in a small room.\u2019 \u201d The driving was so erratic that the officer observed other drivers\u2014in heavy traffic\u2014taking evasive maneuvers to avoid defendant\u2019s car.\nDefendant\u2019s conduct in this case was distinguishable from that of the defendants in Fields and State v. Peele, 196 N.C. App. 668, 675 S.E.2d 682 (2009), the cases upon which defendant relies. In Fields, this Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a traffic stop when the officer attempted to justify his stop based only on the fact that he saw the defendant weave within his lane three times over one and a half miles. 195 N.C. App. at 746, 673 S.E.2d at 769. In Peele, this Court found that an unreliable anonymous tip coupled with the defendant\u2019s weaving a single time did not create a reasonable suspicion to justify the stop. 196 N.C. App. at 671, 675 S.E.2d at 685. Thus, neither Fields nor Peele involved the level of erratic driving and potential danger to other drivers that was involved in this case.\nWe hold the trial court properly concluded that Officer Coleman had the \u201cminimal level of objective justification\u201d that our courts have required to constitute reasonable suspicion. Watkins, 337 N.C. at 442, 446 S.E.2d at 70. Therefore, the stop was proper, and the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\nNo error.\nJudges STEELMAN and BEASLEY concur.", "author": "GEER, Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "parties": ["STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.
