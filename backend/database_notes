Notes

- firstly do pip install pyodbc
- Download ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
- The username and the password should be the same for everyone i think, because it is the admins username and password
- If it doesnt work and doesnt give you access, you have to go to the Networking section in the SQL server and add your IP address
