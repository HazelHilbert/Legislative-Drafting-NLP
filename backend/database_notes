Notes

- firstly do pip install pyodbc
- Download ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
- May have to use phone hotspot as Trinity WiFi has a firewall against database connection
- The username and the password should be the same for everyone i think, because it is the admins username and password
- If it doesnt work and doesnt give you access, you have to go to the Networking section in the SQL server and add your IP address

- The commented out code creates a table in the database

run SELECT * FROM databaseTest; in the query editor on azure, logging in with the username and password in the code. This will print out all the files saved.

The data is converted from text to binary.
