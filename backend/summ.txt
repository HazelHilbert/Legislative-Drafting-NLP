Per Curiam. Appellant Robert Lewis by his attorney Sandra Cordi has filed a motion for rule on the clerk. His attorney admits that the record was tendered late due to a mistake on her part. We find that such error admittedly made by the attorney for a criminal defendant is good cause to grant the motion. See Terry v. State 272 Ark. 243 613 S.W.2d 90 (1981); In Re: Belated Appeals in Criminal Cases 295 Ark. 964 (1979)(per curiam). A copy of this per curiam will be forwarded to the Committee on Professional Conduct. In Re: Belated Appeals in Criminal Cases supra.
