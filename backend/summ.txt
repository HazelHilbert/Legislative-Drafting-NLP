Child abuse prevention.   reporting.    Existing law identifies specified persons as mandated reporterswho must submit a report to law enforcement whenever in theirprofessional capacity or within the scope of their employment, theyhave knowledge of or observe a child who is known or reasonablysuspected to have been the victim of child abuse or neglect. Existinglaw defines the term "reasonable suspicion" for purposes of thesechild abuse reporting provisions.   This bill would provide that "reasonable suspicion" does notrequire  certain knowledge   certainty that child abuse or neglect has occurred nor does it require aspecific medical indication of child abuse or neglect. The bill wouldalso provide that "reasonable suspicion" may be based on anyinformation considered credible by the reporter, including hearsay   statements from other individuals  .   Existing law requires the Department of Justice to maintain anindex of all reports of child abuse and severe neglect submitted byagencies mandated to make those reports.     This bill would require the department to make available tocertain health care practitioners who have delivered or treated anewborn infant information regarding any known or suspected childabuser maintained on the index concerning any parent or primary careprovider of the newborn infant. The bill would provide that thehealth care practitioner is responsible for obtaining the originalinvestigative report from the reporting agency and for drawingindependent conclusions on the evidence for purposes of evaluatingthe necessity for a child welfare risk assessment. The bill wouldrequire the health care practitioner to notify the local childprotective services agency if it is determined that a child welfarerisk assessment is appropriate.     Existing law requires a person convicted of any specified sexoffenses to register as a sex offender and provide specifiedinformation to law enforcement agencies. That information is kept atthe location where the offender registered and transmitted to theDepartment of Justice where it is electronically stored in theViolent Crime Information Network (VCIN), as specified.    This bill would require the Department of Justice to study thefeasibility and value of requiring every person who must register asa sex offender to include in the information provided by the personall e-mail addresses and instant message addresses, all screen namesand online pseudonyms, and all Internet protocol addresses he or sheuses, or intends to use, to communicate over the Internet. The billwould require the department's study to include a determination ofthe value and feasibility of incorporating this information in theVCIN, and would require the department to complete and publish itsreport by December 31, 2011.     This bill would make technical and conforming changes.    Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee:  yes  no  . State-mandated local program: no.THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:  SECTION 1.  Section 11166 of the Penal Code is amended to read:   11166.
