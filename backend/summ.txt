During this sprint we designed the project, laying out its aims and specifications. We planned each sprint in turn and brainstormed the technologies we would use. During the latter half of the sprint, we created a proof of concept in the form of a prototype, using the OpenAI API to process legislative data and provide insights. In the future we will create our own model. We reviewed our design decisions with all of the relevant stakeholders and showed them a video that showcased the development of our prototype. The feedback we received ensured that the clients and academic staff were satisfied with the outcome of this sprint. The product’s backlog was updated to match its new requirements. Initially, the NLP model would simply provide insights into the temporal and citation elements of the input legislation, but we decided to expand on our project specifications and allow our model to provide a summary of said legislation.
