Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed A yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air He held the bowl aloft and intoned

Introibo ad altare Dei

Halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely

Come up Kinch Come up you fearful jesuit

Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak

Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly

Back to barracks he said sternly

He added in a preachers tone

For this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul and blood and ouns Slow music please Shut your eyes gents One moment A little trouble about those white corpuscles Silence all

He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points Chrysostomos Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm

Thanks old chap he cried briskly That will do nicely Switch off the current will you

He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips

The mockery of it he said gaily Your absurd name an ancient Greek

He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck

Buck Mulligans gay voice went on

My name is absurd too Malachi Mulligan two dactyls But it has a Hellenic ring hasnt it Tripping and sunny like the buck himself We must go to Athens Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid

He laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried

Will he come The jejune jesuit

Ceasing he began to shave with care

Tell me Mulligan Stephen said quietly

Yes my love

How long is Haines going to stay in this tower

Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder

God isnt he dreadful he said frankly A ponderous Saxon He thinks youre not a gentleman God these bloody English Bursting with money and indigestion Because he comes from Oxford You know Dedalus you have the real Oxford manner He cant make you out O my name for you is the best Kinch the knifeblade

He shaved warily over his chin

He was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said Where is his guncase

A woful lunatic Mulligan said Were you in a funk

I was Stephen said with energy and growing fear Out here in the dark with a man I dont know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther You saved men from drowning Im not a hero however If he stays on here I am off

Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily

Scutter he cried thickly

He came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephens upper pocket said

Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor

Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly Then gazing over the handkerchief he said

The bards noserag A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreen You can almost taste it cant you

He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly

God he said quietly Isnt the sea what Algy calls it a great sweet mother The snotgreen sea The scrotumtightening sea Epi oinopa ponton Ah Dedalus the Greeks I must teach you You must read them in the original Thalatta Thalatta She is our great sweet mother Come and look

Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown

Our mighty mother Buck Mulligan said

He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephens face

The aunt thinks you killed your mother he said Thats why she wont let me have anything to do with you

Someone killed her Stephen said gloomily

You could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying mother asked you Buck Mulligan said Im hyperborean as much as you But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her And you refused There is something sinister in you

He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek A tolerant smile curled his lips

But a lovely mummer he murmured to himself Kinch the loveliest mummer of them all

He shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously

Stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coatsleeve Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart Silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting

Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade

Ah poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice I must give you a shirt and a few noserags How are the secondhand breeks

They fit well enough Stephen answered

Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip

The mockery of it he said contentedly Secondleg they should be God knows what poxy bowsy left them off I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey Youll look spiffing in them Im not joking Kinch You look damn well when youre dressed

Thanks Stephen said I cant wear them if they are grey

He cant wear them Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror Etiquette is etiquette He kills his mother but he cant wear grey trousers

He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin

Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes

That fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan says you have g p i Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman General paralysis of the insane

He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk

Look at yourself he said you dreadful bard

Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack Hair on end As he and others see me Who chose this face for me This dogsbody to rid of vermin It asks me too

I pinched it out of the skivvys room Buck Mulligan said It does her all right The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi Lead him not into temptation And her name is Ursula

Laughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephens peering eyes

The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said If Wilde were only alive to see you

Drawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitterness

It is a symbol of Irish art The cracked lookingglass of a servant

Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them

Its not fair to tease you like that Kinch is it he said kindly God knows you have more spirit than any of them

Parried again He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his The cold steel pen

Cracked lookingglass of a servant Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea Hes stinking with money and thinks youre not a gentleman His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other God Kinch if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island Hellenise it

Cranlys arm His arm

And to think of your having to beg from these swine Im the only one that knows what you are Why dont you trust me more What have you up your nose against me Is it Haines If he makes any noise here Ill bring down Seymour and well give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe

Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpes rooms Palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another O I shall expire Break the news to her gently Aubrey I shall die With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailors shears A scared calfs face gilded with marmalade I dont want to be debagged Dont you play the giddy ox with me

Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle A deaf gardener aproned masked with Matthew Arnolds face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms

To ourselves new paganism omphalos

Let him stay Stephen said Theres nothing wrong with him except at night

Then what is it Buck Mulligan asked impatiently Cough it up Im quite frank with you What have you against me now

They halted looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale Stephen freed his arm quietly

Do you wish me to tell you he asked

Yes what is it Buck Mulligan answered I dont remember anything

He looked in Stephens face as he spoke A light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes

Stephen depressed by his own voice said

Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothers death

Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said

What Where I cant remember anything I remember only ideas and sensations Why What happened in the name of God

You were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom She asked you who was in your room

Yes Buck Mulligan said What did I say I forget

You said Stephen answered O its only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead

A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligans cheek

Did I say that he asked Well What harm is that

He shook his constraint from him nervously

And what is death he asked your mothers or yours or my own You saw only your mother die I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom Its a beastly thing and nothing else It simply doesnt matter You wouldnt kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you Why Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only its injected the wrong way To me its all a mockery and beastly Her cerebral lobes are not functioning She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt Humour her till its over You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I dont whinge like some hired mute from Lalouettes Absurd I suppose I did say it I didnt mean to offend the memory of your mother

He had spoken himself into boldness Stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly

I am not thinking of the offence to my mother

Of what then Buck Mulligan asked

Of the offence to me Stephen answered

Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel

O an impossible person he exclaimed

He walked off quickly round the parapet Stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland Sea and headland now grew dim Pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks

A voice within the tower called loudly

Are you up there Mulligan

Im coming Buck Mulligan answered

He turned towards Stephen and said

Look at the sea What does it care about offences Chuck Loyola Kinch and come on down The Sassenach wants his morning rashers

His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof

Dont mope over it all day he said Im inconsequent Give up the moody brooding

His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead

And no more turn aside and brood
Upon loves bitter mystery
For Fergus rules the brazen cars

Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet White breast of the dim sea The twining stresses two by two A hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide

A cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green It lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters Fergus song I sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords Her door was open she wanted to hear my music Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside She was crying in her wretched bed For those words Stephen loves bitter mystery

Where now

Her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang

I am the boy
That can enjoy
Invisibility

Phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed

And no more turn aside and brood

Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys Memories beset his brooding brain Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament A cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrens shirts

In a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes

Her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul On me alone The ghostcandle to light her agony Ghostly light on the tortured face Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees Her eyes on me to strike me down Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat

Ghoul Chewer of corpses

No mother Let me be and let me live

Kinch ahoy

Buck Mulligans voice sang from within the tower It came nearer up the staircase calling again Stephen still trembling at his souls cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words

Dedalus come down like a good mosey Breakfast is ready Haines is apologising for waking us last night Its all right

Im coming Stephen said turning

Do for Jesus sake Buck Mulligan said For my sake and for all our sakes

His head disappeared and reappeared

I told him your symbol of Irish art He says its very clever Touch him for a quid will you A guinea I mean

I get paid this morning Stephen said

The school kip Buck Mulligan said How much Four quid Lend us one

If you want it Stephen said

Four shining sovereigns Buck Mulligan cried with delight Well have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids Four omnipotent sovereigns

He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a Cockney accent

O wont we have a merry time
Drinking whisky beer and wine
On coronation
Coronation day
O wont we have a merry time
On coronation day

Warm sunshine merrying over the sea The nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet Why should I bring it down Or leave it there all day forgotten friendship

He went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes I am another now and yet the same A servant too A server of a servant

In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligans gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning

Well be choked Buck Mulligan said Haines open that door will you

Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors

Have you the key a voice asked

Dedalus has it Buck Mulligan said Janey Mack Im choked

He howled without looking up from the fire

Kinch

Its in the lock Stephen said coming forward

The key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered Haines stood at the doorway looking out Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief

Im melting he said as the candle remarked when But hush Not a word more on that subject Kinch wake up Bread butter honey Haines come in The grub is ready Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts Wheres the sugar O jay theres no milk

Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet

What sort of a kip is this he said I told her to come after eight

We can drink it black Stephen said thirstily Theres a lemon in the locker

O damn you and your Paris fads Buck Mulligan said I want Sandycove milk

Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly

That woman is coming up with the milk

The blessings of God on you Buck Mulligan cried jumping up from his chair Sit down Pour out the tea there The sugar is in the bag Here I cant go fumbling at the damned eggs

He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying

In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti

Haines sat down to pour out the tea

Im giving you two lumps each he said But I say Mulligan you do make strong tea dont you

Buck Mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old womans wheedling voice

When I makes tea I makes tea as old mother Grogan said And when I makes water I makes water

By Jove it is tea Haines said

Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling

So I do Mrs Cahill says she Begob maam says Mrs Cahill God send you dont make them in the one pot

He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife

Thats folk he said very earnestly for your book Haines Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind

He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows

Can you recall brother is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads

I doubt it said Stephen gravely

Do you now Buck Mulligan said in the same tone Your reasons pray

I fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of Mary Ann

Buck Mulligans face smiled with delight

Charming he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly Do you think she was Quite charming

Then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf

For old Mary Ann
She doesnt care a damn
But hising up her petticoats

He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned

The doorway was darkened by an entering form

The milk sir

Come in maam Mulligan said Kinch get the jug

An old woman came forward and stood by Stephens elbow

Thats a lovely morning sir she said Glory be to God

To whom Mulligan said glancing at her Ah to be sure

Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker

The islanders Mulligan said to Haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces

How much sir asked the old woman

A quart Stephen said

He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers Old shrunken paps She poured again a measureful and a tilly Old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger She praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs They lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle Silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times A wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning To serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour

It is indeed maam Buck Mulligan said pouring milk into their cups

Taste it sir she said

He drank at her bidding

If we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldnt have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts Living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits

Are you a medical student sir the old woman asked

I am maam Buck Mulligan answered

Look at that now she said

Stephen listened in scornful silence She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her womans unclean loins of mans flesh made not in Gods likeness the serpents prey And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes

Do you understand what he says Stephen asked her

Is it French you are talking sir the old woman said to Haines

Haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently

Irish Buck Mulligan said Is there Gaelic on you

I thought it was Irish she said by the sound of it Are you from the west sir

I am an Englishman Haines answered

Hes English Buck Mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland

Sure we ought to the old woman said and Im ashamed I dont speak the language myself Im told its a grand language by them that knows

Grand is no name for it said Buck Mulligan Wonderful entirely Fill us out some more tea Kinch Would you like a cup maam

No thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go

Haines said to her

Have you your bill We had better pay her Mulligan hadnt we

Stephen filled again the three cups

Bill sir she said halting Well its seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling Thats a shilling and one and two is two and two sir

Buck Mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets

Pay up and look pleasant Haines said to him smiling

Stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk Buck Mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried

A miracle

He passed it along the table towards the old woman saying

Ask nothing more of me sweet All I can give you I give

Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand

Well owe twopence he said

Time enough sir she said taking the coin Time enough Good morning sir

She curtseyed and went out followed by Buck Mulligans tender chant

Heart of my heart were it more
More would be laid at your feet

He turned to Stephen and said

Seriously Dedalus Im stony Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money Today the bards must drink and junket Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty

That reminds me Haines said rising that I have to visit your national library today

Our swim first Buck Mulligan said

He turned to Stephen and asked blandly

Is this the day for your monthly wash Kinch

Then he said to Haines

The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month

All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf

Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke

I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me

Speaking to me They wash and tub and scrub Agenbite of inwit Conscience Yet heres a spot

That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good

Buck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said with warmth of tone

Wait till you hear him on Hamlet Haines

Well I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in

Would I make any money by it Stephen asked

Haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said

I dont know Im sure

He strolled out to the doorway Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour

You put your hoof in it now What did you say that for

Well Stephen said The problem is to get money From whom From the milkwoman or from him Its a toss up I think

I blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes

I see little hope Stephen said from her or from him

Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens arm

From me Kinch he said

In a suddenly changed tone he added

To tell you the Gods truth I think youre right Damn all else they are good for Why dont you play them as I do To hell with them all Let us get out of the kip

He stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly

Mulligan is stripped of his garments

He emptied his pockets on to the table

Theres your snotrag he said

And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief God well simply have to dress the character I want puce gloves and green boots Contradiction Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradict myself Mercurial Malachi A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands

And theres your Latin quarter hat he said

Stephen picked it up and put it on Haines called to them from the doorway

Are you coming you fellows

Im ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door Come out Kinch You have eaten all we left I suppose Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow

And going forth he met Butterly

Stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it He put the huge key in his inner pocket

At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked

Did you bring the key

I have it Stephen said preceding them

He walked on Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses

Down sir How dare you sir

Haines asked

Do you pay rent for this tower

Twelve quid Buck Mulligan said

To the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulder

They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last

Rather bleak in wintertime I should say Martello you call it

Billy Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were on the sea But ours is the omphalos

What is your idea of Hamlet Haines asked Stephen

No no Buck Mulligan shouted in pain Im not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up Wait till I have a few pints in me first

He turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat

You couldnt manage it under three pints Kinch could you

It has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longer

You pique my curiosity Haines said amiably Is it some paradox

Pooh Buck Mulligan said We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes Its quite simple He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson is Shakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father

What Haines said beginning to point at Stephen He himself

Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to Stephens ear

O shade of Kinch the elder Japhet in search of a father

Were always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines And it is rather long to tell

Buck Mulligan walking forward again raised his hands

The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he said

I mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore That beetles oer his base into the sea isnt it

Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires

Its a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt again

Eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent The seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins

I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused The Father and the Son idea The Son striving to be atoned with the Father

Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face He looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety He moved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice

Im the queerest young fellow that ever you heard
My mothers a jew my fathers a bird
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree
So heres to disciples and Calvary

He held up a forefinger of warning

If anyone thinks that I amnt divine
Hell get no free drinks when Im making the wine
But have to drink water and wish it were plain
That I make when the wine becomes water again

He tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted

Goodbye now goodbye Write down all I said
And tell Tom Dick and Harry I rose from the dead
Whats bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivets breezy Goodbye now goodbye

He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries

Haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephen and said

We oughtnt to laugh I suppose Hes rather blasphemous Im not a believer myself that is to say Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesnt it What did he call it Joseph the Joiner

The ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answered

O Haines said you have heard it before

Three times a day after meals Stephen said drily

Youre not a believer are you Haines asked I mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God

Theres only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen said

Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it

Thank you Stephen said taking a cigarette

Haines helped himself and snapped the case to He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands

Yes of course he said as they went on again Either you believe or you dont isnt it Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personal God You dont stand for that I suppose

You behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought

He walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side Its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels My familiar after me calling Steeeeeeeeeeeephen A wavering line along the path They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark He wants that key It is mine I paid the rent Now I eat his salt bread Give him the key too All He will ask for it That was in his eyes

After all Haines began

Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind

After all I should think you are able to free yourself You are your own master it seems to me

I am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an Italian

Italian Haines said

A crazy queen old and jealous Kneel down before me

And a third Stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs

Italian Haines said again What do you mean

The imperial British state Stephen answered his colour rising and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church

Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke

I can quite understand that he said calmly An Irishman must think like that I daresay We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly It seems history is to blame

The proud potent titles clanged over Stephens memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one and Arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father and Valentine spurning Christs terrene body and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger Idle mockery The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church Michaels host who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields

Hear hear Prolonged applause Zut Nom de Dieu

Of course Im a Britisher Hainess voice said and I feel as one I dont want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either Thats our national problem Im afraid just now

Two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman

Shes making for Bullock harbour

The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain

Theres five fathoms out there he said Itll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one Its nine days today

The man that was drowned A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite Here I am

They followed the winding path down to the creek Buck Mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water

Is the brother with you Malachi

Down in Westmeath With the Bannons

Still there I got a card from Bannon Says he found a sweet young thing down there Photo girl he calls her

Snapshot eh Brief exposure

Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face He scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth

Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at Haines and Stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone

Seymours back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock Chucked medicine and going in for the army

Ah go to God Buck Mulligan said

Going over next week to stew You know that red Carlisle girl Lily

Yes

Spooning with him last night on the pier The father is rotto with money

Is she up the pole

Better ask Seymour that

Seymour a bleeding officer Buck Mulligan said

He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely

Redheaded women buck like goats

He broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt

My twelfth rib is gone he cried Im the bermensch Toothless Kinch and I the supermen

He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay

Are you going in here Malachi

Yes Make room in the bed

The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes Haines sat down on a stone smoking

Are you not coming in Buck Mulligan asked

Later on Haines said Not on my breakfast

Stephen turned away

Im going Mulligan he said

Give us that key Kinch Buck Mulligan said to keep my chemise flat

Stephen handed him the key Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes

And twopence he said for a pint Throw it there

Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap Dressing undressing Buck Mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly

He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord Thus spake Zarathustra

His plump body plunged

Well see you again Haines said turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish

Horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a Saxon

The Ship Buck Mulligan cried Half twelve

Good Stephen said

He walked along the upwardcurving path

Liliata rutilantium
Turma circumdet
Iubilantium te virginum

The priests grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly I will not sleep here tonight Home also I cannot go

A voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea Turning the curve he waved his hand It called again A sleek brown head a seals far out on the water round

Usurper
 2 

You Cochrane what city sent for him

Tarentum sir

Very good Well

There was a battle sir

Very good Where

The boys blank face asked the blank window

Fabled by the daughters of memory And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it A phrase then of impatience thud of Blakes wings of excess I hear the ruin of all space shattered glass and toppling masonry and time one livid final flame Whats left us then

I forget the place sir 279 B C

Asculum Stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book

Yes sir And he said Another victory like that and we are done for

That phrase the world had remembered A dull ease of the mind From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers leaned upon his spear Any general to any officers They lend ear

You Armstrong Stephen said What was the end of Pyrrhus

End of Pyrrhus sir

I know sir Ask me sir Comyn said

Wait You Armstrong Do you know anything about Pyrrhus

A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrongs satchel He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips A sweetened boys breath Welloff people proud that their eldest son was in the navy Vico Road Dalkey

Pyrrhus sir Pyrrhus a pier

All laughed Mirthless high malicious laughter Armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile In a moment they will laugh more loudly aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay

Tell me now Stephen said poking the boys shoulder with the book what is a pier

A pier sir Armstrong said A thing out in the water A kind of a bridge Kingstown pier sir

Some laughed again mirthless but with meaning Two in the back bench whispered Yes They knew had never learned nor ever been innocent All With envy he watched their faces Edith Ethel Gerty Lily Their likes their breaths too sweetened with tea and jam their bracelets tittering in the struggle

Kingstown pier Stephen said Yes a disappointed bridge

The words troubled their gaze

How sir Comyn asked A bridge is across a river

For Hainess chapbook Noone here to hear Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind What then A jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement masters praise Why had they chosen all that part Not wholly for the smooth caress For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop

Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldams hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death They are not to be thought away Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted But can those have been possible seeing that they never were Or was that only possible which came to pass Weave weaver of the wind

Tell us a story sir

O do sir A ghoststory

Where do you begin in this Stephen asked opening another book

Weep no more Comyn said

Go on then Talbot

And the story sir

After Stephen said Go on Talbot

A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text

Weep no more woful shepherds weep no more
For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor

It must be a movement then an actuality of the possible as possible Aristotles phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of Paris night by night By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy Fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my minds darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds Thought is the thought of thought Tranquil brightness The soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms Tranquility sudden vast candescent form of forms

Talbot repeated

Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves
Through the dear might

Turn over Stephen said quietly I dont see anything

What sir Talbot asked simply bending forward

His hand turned the page over He leaned back and went on again having just remembered Of him that walked the waves Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffers heart and lips and on mine It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute To Caesar what is Caesars to God what is Gods A long look from dark eyes a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the churchs looms Ay

Riddle me riddle me randy ro
My father gave me seeds to sow

Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel

Have I heard all Stephen asked

Yes sir Hockey at ten sir

Half day sir Thursday

Who can answer a riddle Stephen asked

They bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily

A riddle sir Ask me sir

O ask me sir

A hard one sir

This is the riddle Stephen said

The cock crew
The sky was blue
The bells in heaven
Were striking eleven
Tis time for this poor soul
To go to heaven

What is that

What sir

Again sir We didnt hear

Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated After a silence Cochrane said

What is it sir We give it up

Stephen his throat itching answered

The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush

He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay

A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called

Hockey

They broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues

Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading On his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snails bed

He held out his copybook The word Sums was written on the headline Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot Cyril Sargent his name and seal

Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir

Stephen touched the edges of the book Futility

Do you understand how to do them now he asked

Numbers eleven to fifteen Sargent answered Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board sir

Can you do them yourself Stephen asked

No sir

Ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink a snails bed Yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own Was that then real The only true thing in life His mothers prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode She was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been A poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped

Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem He proves by algebra that Shakespeares ghost is Hamlets grandfather Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field

Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes Give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the Moors Gone too from the world Averroes and Moses Maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend

Do you understand now Can you work the second for yourself

Yes sir

In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin Amor matris subjective and objective genitive With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands

Like him was I these sloping shoulders this gracelessness My childhood bends beside me Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly Mine is far and his secret as our eyes Secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned

The sum was done

It is very simple Stephen said as he stood up

Yes sir Thanks Sargent answered

He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench

You had better get your stick and go out to the others Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boys graceless form

Yes sir

In the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield

Sargent

Run on Stephen said Mr Deasy is calling you

He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him He turned his angry white moustache

What is it now he cried continually without listening

Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen said

Will you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restore order here

And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voice cried sternly

What is the matter What is it now

Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head

Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs As on the first day he bargained with me here As it was in the beginning is now On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be And snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end

A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table

First our little financial settlement he said

He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong It slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table

Two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away

And now his strongroom for the gold Stephens embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emirs turban and this the scallop of saint James An old pilgrims hoard dead treasure hollow shells

A sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth

Three Mr Deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand These are handy things to have See This is for sovereigns This is for shillings Sixpences halfcrowns And here crowns See

He shot from it two crowns and two shillings

Three twelve he said I think youll find thats right

Thank you sir Stephen said gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers

No thanks at all Mr Deasy said You have earned it

Stephens hand free again went back to the hollow shells Symbols too of beauty and of power A lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery

Dont carry it like that Mr Deasy said Youll pull it out somewhere and lose it You just buy one of these machines Youll find them very handy

Answer something

Mine would be often empty Stephen said

The same room and hour the same wisdom and I the same Three times now Three nooses round me here Well I can break them in this instant if I will

Because you dont save Mr Deasy said pointing his finger You dont know yet what money is Money is power When you have lived as long as I have I know I know If youth but knew But what does Shakespeare say Put but money in thy purse

Iago Stephen murmured

He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old mans stare

He knew what money was Mr Deasy said He made money A poet yes but an Englishman too Do you know what is the pride of the English Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishmans mouth

The seas ruler His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words unhating

That on his empire Stephen said the sun never sets

Ba Mr Deasy cried Thats not English A French Celt said that He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail

I will tell you he said solemnly what is his proudest boast I paid my way

Good man good man

I paid my way I never borrowed a shilling in my life Can you feel that I owe nothing Can you

Mulligan nine pounds three pairs of socks one pair brogues ties Curran ten guineas McCann one guinea Fred Ryan two shillings Temple two lunches Russell one guinea Cousins ten shillings Bob Reynolds half a guinea Koehler three guineas Mrs MacKernan five weeks board The lump I have is useless

For the moment no Stephen answered

Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight putting back his savingsbox

I knew you couldnt he said joyously But one day you must feel it We are a generous people but we must also be just

I fear those big words Stephen said which make us so unhappy

Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs Albert Edward prince of Wales

You think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said I saw three generations since OConnells time I remember the famine in 46 Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before OConnell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue You fenians forget some things

Glorious pious and immortal memory The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes Hoarse masked and armed the planters covenant The black north and true blue bible Croppies lie down

Stephen sketched a brief gesture

I have rebel blood in me too Mr Deasy said On the spindle side But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union We are all Irish all kings sons

Alas Stephen said

Per vias rectas Mr Deasy said firmly was his motto He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so

Lal the ral the ra
The rocky road to Dublin

A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots Soft day sir John Soft day your honour Day Day Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin Lal the ral the ra Lal the ral the raddy

That reminds me Mr Deasy said You can do me a favour Mr Dedalus with some of your literary friends I have a letter here for the press Sit down a moment I have just to copy the end

He went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter

Sit down Excuse me he said over his shoulder the dictates of common sense Just a moment

He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error

Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord Hastings Repulse the duke of Westminsters Shotover the duke of Beauforts Ceylon prix de Paris 1866 Elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign He saw their speeds backing kings colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds

Full stop Mr Deasy bade his keys But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question

Where Cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen over the motley slush Even money Fair Rebel Ten to one the field Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman a butchers dame nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange

Shouts rang shrill from the boys playfield and a whirring whistle

Again a goal I am among them among their battling bodies in a medley the joust of life You mean that knockkneed mothers darling who seems to be slightly crawsick Jousts Time shocked rebounds shock by shock Jousts slush and uproar of battles the frozen deathspew of the slain a shout of spearspikes baited with mens bloodied guts

Now then Mr Deasy said rising

He came to the table pinning together his sheets Stephen stood up

I have put the matter into a nutshell Mr Deasy said Its about the foot and mouth disease Just look through it There can be no two opinions on the matter

May I trespass on your valuable space That doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history Our cattle trade The way of all our old industries Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme European conflagration Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture Pardoned a classical allusion Cassandra By a woman who was no better than she should be To come to the point at issue

I dont mince words do I Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on

Foot and mouth disease Known as Kochs preparation Serum and virus Percentage of salted horses Rinderpest Emperors horses at Mrzsteg lower Austria Veterinary surgeons Mr Henry Blackwood Price Courteous offer a fair trial Dictates of common sense Allimportant question In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns

I want that to be printed and read Mr Deasy said You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle And it can be cured It is cured My cousin Blackwood Price writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there They offer to come over here I am trying to work up influence with the department Now Im going to try publicity I am surrounded by difficulties by intrigues by backstairs influence by

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke

Mark my words Mr Dedalus he said England is in the hands of the jews In all the highest places her finance her press And they are the signs of a nations decay Wherever they gather they eat up the nations vital strength I have seen it coming these years As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction Old England is dying

He stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam He faced about and back again

Dying he said again if not dead by now

The harlots cry from street to street
Shall weave old Englands windingsheet

His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted

A merchant Stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not

They sinned against the light Mr Deasy said gravely And you can see the darkness in their eyes And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day

On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers Gabble of geese They swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats Not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures Their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain Vain patience to heap and hoard Time surely would scatter all A hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on Their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh

Who has not Stephen said

What do you mean Mr Deasy asked

He came forward a pace and stood by the table His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly Is this old wisdom He waits to hear from me

History Stephen said is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake

From the playfield the boys raised a shout A whirring whistle goal What if that nightmare gave you a back kick

The ways of the Creator are not our ways Mr Deasy said All human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of God

Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window saying

That is God

Hooray Ay Whrrwhee

What Mr Deasy asked

A shout in the street Stephen answered shrugging his shoulders

Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers Looking up again he set them free

I am happier than you are he said We have committed many errors and many sins A woman brought sin into the world For a woman who was no better than she should be Helen the runaway wife of Menelaus ten years the Greeks made war on Troy A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here MacMurroughs wife and her leman ORourke prince of Breffni A woman too brought Parnell low Many errors many failures but not the one sin I am a struggler now at the end of my days But I will fight for the right till the end

For Ulster will fight
And Ulster will be right

Stephen raised the sheets in his hand

Well sir he began

I foresee Mr Deasy said that you will not remain here very long at this work You were not born to be a teacher I think Perhaps I am wrong

A learner rather Stephen said

And here what will you learn more

Mr Deasy shook his head

Who knows he said To learn one must be humble But life is the great teacher

Stephen rustled the sheets again

As regards these he began

Yes Mr Deasy said You have two copies there If you can have them published at once

Telegraph Irish Homestead

I will try Stephen said and let you know tomorrow I know two editors slightly

That will do Mr Deasy said briskly I wrote last night to Mr Field MP There is a meeting of the cattletraders association today at the City Arms hotel I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting You see if you can get it into your two papers What are they

The Evening Telegraph

That will do Mr Deasy said There is no time to lose Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin

Good morning sir Stephen said putting the sheets in his pocket Thank you

Not at all Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk I like to break a lance with you old as I am

Good morning sir Stephen said again bowing to his bent back

He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors Still I will help him in his fight Mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard

Mr Dedalus

Running after me No more letters I hope

Just one moment

Yes sir Stephen said turning back at the gate

Mr Deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath

I just wanted to say he said Ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews Do you know that No And do you know why

He frowned sternly on the bright air

Why sir Stephen asked beginning to smile

Because she never let them in Mr Deasy said solemnly

A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm He turned back quickly coughing laughing his lifted arms waving to the air

She never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path Thats why

On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles dancing coins

He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots The new air greeted him harping in wild nerves wind of wild air of seeds of brightness Here I am not walking out to the Kish lightship am I He stood suddenly his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil Turn back

Turning he scanned the shore south his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets The cold domed room of the tower waits Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever slowly ever as my feet are sinking creeping duskward over the dial floor Blue dusk nightfall deep blue night In the darkness of the dome they wait their pushedback chairs my obelisk valise around a board of abandoned platters Who to clear it He has the key I will not sleep there when this night comes A shut door of a silent tower entombing their blind bodies the panthersahib and his pointer Call no answer He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders Take all keep all My soul walks with me form of forms So in the moons midwatches I pace the path above the rocks in sable silvered hearing Elsinores tempting flood

The flood is following me I can watch it flow past from here Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock resting his ashplant in a grike

Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand trotting sniffing on all sides Looking for something lost in a past life Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare ears flung back chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull The mans shrieked whistle struck his limp ears He turned bounded back came nearer trotted on twinkling shanks On a field tenney a buck trippant proper unattired At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs seawardpointed ears His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise herds of seamorse They serpented towards his feet curling unfurling many crests every ninth breaking plashing from far from farther out waves and waves

Cocklepickers They waded a little way in the water and stooping soused their bags and lifting them again waded out The dog yelped running to them reared up and pawed them dropping on all fours again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand a rag of wolfs tongue redpanting from his jaws His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calfs gallop The carcass lay on his path He stopped sniffed stalked round it brother nosing closer went round it sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dogs bedraggled fell Dogskull dogsniff eyes on the ground moves to one great goal Ah poor dogsbody Here lies poor dogsbodys body

Tatters Out of that you mongrel

The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand crouched in flight He slunk back in a curve Doesnt see me Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped dawdled smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it He trotted forward and lifting again his hindleg pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock The simple pleasures of the poor His hindpaws then scattered the sand then his forepaws dabbled and delved Something he buried there his grandmother He rooted in the sand dabbling delving and stopped to listen to the air scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws soon ceasing a pard a panther got in spousebreach vulturing the dead

His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent ending Why not endless till the farthest star Darkly they are there behind this light darkness shining in the brightness delta of Cassiopeia worlds Me sits there with his augurs rod of ash in borrowed sandals by day beside a livid sea unbeheld in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars I throw this ended shadow from me manshape ineluctable call it back Endless would it be mine form of my form Who watches me here Who ever anywhere will read these written words Signs on a white field Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field Hold hard Coloured on a flat yes thats right Flat I see then think distance near far flat I see east back Ah see now Falls back suddenly frozen in stereoscope Click does the trick You find my words dark Darkness is in our souls do you not think Flutier Our souls shamewounded by our sins cling to us yet more a woman to her lover clinging the more the more

Touch me Soft eyes Soft soft soft hand I am lonely here O touch me soon now What is that word known to all men I am quiet here alone Sad too Touch touch me

He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket his hat tilted down on his eyes That is Kevin Egans movement I made nodding for his nap sabbath sleep Et vidit Deus Et erant valde bona Alo Bonjour Welcome as the flowers in May Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun I am caught in this burning scene Pans hour the faunal noon Among gumheavy serpentplants milkoozing fruits where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide Pain is far

And no more turn aside and brood

His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots a bucks castoffs nebeneinander He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein anothers foot had nested warm The foot that beat the ground in tripudium foot I dislove But you were delighted when Esther Osvalts shoe went on you girl I knew in Paris Tiens quel petit pied Staunch friend a brother soul Wildes love that dare not speak its name His arm Cranlys arm He now will leave me And the blame As I am As I am All or not at all

My handkerchief He threw it I remember Did I not take it up

His hand groped vainly in his pockets No I didnt Better buy one

He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock carefully For the rest let look who will

Behind Perhaps there is someone

He turned his face over a shoulder rere regardant Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster her sails brailed up on the crosstrees homing upstream silently moving a silent ship

Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls He liked thick giblet soup nutty gizzards a stuffed roast heart liverslices fried with crustcrumbs fried hencods roes Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine

Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere Made him feel a bit peckish

The coals were reddening

Another slice of bread and butter three four right She didnt like her plate full Right He turned from the tray lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire It sat there dull and squat its spout stuck out Cup of tea soon Good Mouth dry The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high

Mkgnao

O there you are Mr Bloom said turning from the fire

The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table mewing Just how she stalks over my writingtable Prr Scratch my head Prr

Mr Bloom watched curiously kindly the lithe black form Clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide the white button under the butt of her tail the green flashing eyes He bent down to her his hands on his knees

Milk for the pussens he said

Mrkgnao the cat cried

They call them stupid They understand what we say better than we understand them She understands all she wants to Vindictive too Cruel Her nature Curious mice never squeal Seem to like it Wonder what I look like to her Height of a tower No she can jump me

Afraid of the chickens she is he said mockingly Afraid of the chookchooks I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens

Mrkrgnao the cat said loudly

She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes mewing plaintively and long showing him her milkwhite teeth He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones Then he went to the dresser took the jug Hanlons milkman had just filled for him poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor

Gurrhr she cried running to lap

He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly Wonder is it true if you clip them they cant mouse after Why They shine in the dark perhaps the tips Or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps

He listened to her licking lap Ham and eggs no No good eggs with this drouth Want pure fresh water Thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckleys Fried with butter a shake of pepper Better a pork kidney at Dlugaczs While the kettle is boiling She lapped slower then licking the saucer clean Why are their tongues so rough To lap better all porous holes Nothing she can eat He glanced round him No

On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door She might like something tasty Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning Still perhaps once in a way

He said softly in the bare hall

Im going round the corner Be back in a minute

And when he had heard his voice say it he added

You dont want anything for breakfast

A sleepy soft grunt answered

Mn

No She didnt want anything He heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled Must get those settled really Pity All the way from Gibraltar Forgotten any little Spanish she knew Wonder what her father gave for it Old style Ah yes of course Bought it at the governors auction Got a short knock Hard as nails at a bargain old Tweedy Yes sir At Plevna that was I rose from the ranks sir and Im proud of it Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps Now that was farseeing

His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof Stamps stickyback pictures Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too Course they do The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely Plastos high grade ha He peeped quickly inside the leather headband White slip of paper Quite safe

On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey Not there In the trousers I left off Must get it Potato I have Creaky wardrobe No use disturbing her She turned over sleepily that time He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly more till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold a limp lid Looked shut All right till I come back anyhow

He crossed to the bright side avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive The sun was nearing the steeple of Georges church Be a warm day I fancy Specially in these black clothes feel it more Black conducts reflects refracts is it the heat But I couldnt go in that light suit Make a picnic of it His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth Bolands breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterdays loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot Makes you feel young Somewhere in the east early morning set off at dawn Travel round in front of the sun steal a days march on him Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically Walk along a strand strange land come to a city gate sentry there old ranker too old Tweedys big moustaches leaning on a long kind of a spear Wander through awned streets Turbaned faces going by Dark caves of carpet shops big man Turko the terrible seated crosslegged smoking a coiled pipe Cries of sellers in the streets Drink water scented with fennel sherbet Dander along all day Might meet a robber or two Well meet him Getting on to sundown The shadows of the mosques among the pillars priest with a scroll rolled up A shiver of the trees signal the evening wind I pass on Fading gold sky A mother watches me from her doorway She calls her children home in their dark language High wall beyond strings twanged Night sky moon violet colour of Mollys new garters Strings Listen A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them dulcimers I pass

Probably not a bit like it really Kind of stuff you read in the track of the sun Sunburst on the titlepage He smiled pleasing himself What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the Freeman leader a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland He prolonged his pleased smile Ikey touch that homerule sun rising up in the northwest

He approached Larry ORourkes From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger teadust biscuitmush Good house however just the end of the city traffic For instance MAuleys down there n g as position Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot

Baldhead over the blind Cute old codger No use canvassing him for an ad Still he knows his own business best There he is sure enough my bold Larry leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up Do you know what Im going to tell you Whats that Mr ORourke Do you know what The Russians theyd only be an eight oclock breakfast for the Japanese

Stop and say a word about the funeral perhaps Sad thing about poor Dignam Mr ORourke

Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway

Good day Mr ORourke

Good day to you

Lovely weather sir

Tis all that

Where do they get the money Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim rinsing empties and old man in the cellar Then lo and behold they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons Then think of the competition General thirst Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub Save it they cant Off the drunks perhaps Put down three and carry five What is that a bob here and there dribs and drabs On the wholesale orders perhaps Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers Square it you with the boss and well split the job see

How much would that tot to off the porter in the month Say ten barrels of stuff Say he got ten per cent off O more Fifteen He passed Saint Josephs National school Brats clamour Windows open Fresh air helps memory Or a lilt Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou Boys are they Yes Inishturk Inishark Inishboffin At their joggerfry Mine Slieve Bloom

He halted before Dlugaczs window staring at the hanks of sausages polonies black and white Fifteen multiplied by The figures whitened in his mind unsolved displeased he let them fade The shiny links packed with forcemeat fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs blood

A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish the last He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter Would she buy it too calling the items from a slip in her hand Chapped washingsoda And a pound and a half of Dennys sausages His eyes rested on her vigorous hips Woods his name is Wonder what he does Wife is oldish New blood No followers allowed Strong pair of arms Whacking a carpet on the clothesline She does whack it by George The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack

The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers sausagepink Sound meat there like a stallfed heifer

He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias Can become ideal winter sanatorium Moses Montefiore I thought he was Farmhouse wall round it blurred cattle cropping He held the page from him interesting read it nearer the title the blurred cropping cattle the page rustling A young white heifer Those mornings in the cattlemarket the beasts lowing in their pens branded sheep flop and fall of dung the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter theres a prime one unpeeled switches in their hands He held the page aslant patiently bending his senses and his will his soft subject gaze at rest The crooked skirt swinging whack by whack by whack

The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace

Now my miss he said

She tendered a coin smiling boldly holding her thick wrist out

Thank you my miss And one shilling threepence change For you please

Mr Bloom pointed quickly To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly behind her moving hams Pleasant to see first thing in the morning Hurry up damn it Make hay while the sun shines She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right He sighed down his nose they never understand Sodachapped hands Crusted toenails too Brown scapulars in tatters defending her both ways The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast For another a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles Lane They like them sizeable Prime sausage O please Mr Policeman Im lost in the wood

Threepence please

His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles They lay were read quickly and quickly slid disc by disc into the till

Thank you sir Another time

A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him He withdrew his gaze after an instant No better not another time

Good morning he said moving away

Good morning sir

No sign Gone What matter

He walked back along Dorset street reading gravely Agendath Netaim planters company To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees Excellent for shade fuel and construction Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives oranges almonds or citrons Olives cheaper oranges need artificial irrigation Every year you get a sending of the crop Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments Bleibtreustrasse 34 Berlin W 15

Nothing doing Still an idea behind it

He looked at the cattle blurred in silver heat Silverpowdered olivetrees Quiet long days pruning ripening Olives are packed in jars eh I have a few left from Andrews Molly spitting them out Knows the taste of them now Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates Citrons too Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevins parade And Mastiansky with the old cither Pleasant evenings we had then Molly in Citrons basketchair Nice to hold cool waxen fruit hold in the hand lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume Like that heavy sweet wild perfume Always the same year after year They fetched high prices too Moisel told me Arbutus place Pleasants street pleasant old times Must be without a flaw he said Coming all that way Spain Gibraltar Mediterranean the Levant Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa chap ticking them off in a book navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees Theres whatdoyoucallhim out of How do you Doesnt see Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore His back is like that Norwegian captains Wonder if Ill meet him today Watering cart To provoke the rain On earth as it is in heaven

A cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly Grey Far

No not like that A barren land bare waste Vulcanic lake the dead sea no fish weedless sunk deep in the earth No wind could lift those waves grey metal poisonous foggy waters Brimstone they called it raining down the cities of the plain Sodom Gomorrah Edom All dead names A dead sea in a dead land grey and old Old now It bore the oldest the first race A bent hag crossed from Cassidys clutching a naggin bottle by the neck The oldest people Wandered far away over all the earth captivity to captivity multiplying dying being born everywhere It lay there now Now it could bear no more Dead an old womans the grey sunken cunt of the world

Desolation

Grey horror seared his flesh Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street hurrying homeward Cold oils slid along his veins chilling his blood age crusting him with a salt cloak Well I am here now Yes I am here now Morning mouth bad images Got up wrong side of the bed Must begin again those Sandows exercises On the hands down Blotchy brown brick houses Number eighty still unlet Why is that Valuation is only twentyeight Towers Battersby North MacArthur parlour windows plastered with bills Plasters on a sore eye To smell the gentle smoke of tea fume of the pan sizzling butter Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh Yes yes

Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road swiftly in slim sandals along the brightening footpath Runs she runs to meet me a girl with gold hair on the wind

Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor He stooped and gathered them Mrs Marion Bloom His quickened heart slowed at once Bold hand Mrs Marion

Poldy

Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head

Who are the letters for

He looked at them Mullingar Milly

A letter for me from Milly he said carefully and a card to you And a letter for you

He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees

Do you want the blind up

Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow

That do he asked turning

She was reading the card propped on her elbow

She got the things she said

He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh

Hurry up with that tea she said Im parched

The kettle is boiling he said

But he delayed to clear the chair her striped petticoat tossed soiled linen and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed

As he went down the kitchen stairs she called

Poldy

What

Scald the teapot

On the boil sure enough a plume of steam from the spout He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in Having set it to draw he took off the kettle crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him Give her too much meat she wont mouse Say they wont eat pork Kosher Here He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce Pepper He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup

Then he slit open his letter glancing down the page and over Thanks new tam Mr Coghlan lough Owel picnic young student Blazes Boylans seaside girls

The tea was drawn He filled his own moustachecup sham crown Derby smiling Silly Millys birthday gift Only five she was then No wait four I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her He smiled pouring

O Milly Bloom you are my darling
You are my lookingglass from night to morning
Id rather have you without a farthing
Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden

Poor old professor Goodwin Dreadful old case Still he was a courteous old chap Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform And the little mirror in his silk hat The night Milly brought it into the parlour O look what I found in professor Goodwins hat All we laughed Sex breaking out even then Pert little piece she was

He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over then fitted the teapot on the tray Its hump bumped as he took it up Everything on it Bread and butter four sugar spoon her cream Yes He carried it upstairs his thumb hooked in the teapot handle

Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead

What a time you were she said

She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly an elbow on the pillow He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoats udder The warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured

A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread

Who was the letter from he asked

Bold hand Marion

O Boylan she said Hes bringing the programme

What are you singing

L ci darem with J C Doyle she said and Loves Old Sweet Song

Her full lips drinking smiled Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day Like foul flowerwater

Would you like the window open a little

She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth asking

What time is the funeral

Eleven I think he answered I didnt see the paper

Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed No Then a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking rumpled shiny sole

No that book

Other stocking Her petticoat

It must have fell down she said

He felt here and there Voglio e non vorrei Wonder if she pronounces that right voglio Not in the bed Must have slid down He stooped and lifted the valance The book fallen sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot

Show here she said I put a mark in it Theres a word I wanted to ask you

She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word

Met him what he asked

Here she said What does that mean

He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail

Metempsychosis

Yes Whos he when hes at home

Metempsychosis he said frowning Its Greek from the Greek That means the transmigration of souls

O rocks she said Tell us in plain words

He smiled glancing askance at her mocking eyes The same young eyes The first night after the charades Dolphins Barn He turned over the smudged pages Ruby the Pride of the Ring Hello Illustration Fierce Italian with carriagewhip Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked Sheet kindly lent The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath Cruelty behind it all Doped animals Trapeze at Henglers Had to look the other way Mob gaping Break your neck and well break our sides Families of them Bone them young so they metamspychosis That we live after death Our souls That a mans soul after he dies Dignams soul

Did you finish it he asked

Yes she said Theres nothing smutty in it Is she in love with the first fellow all the time

Never read it Do you want another

Yes Get another of Paul de Kocks Nice name he has

She poured more tea into her cup watching it flow sideways

Must get that Capel street library book renewed or theyll write to Kearney my guarantor Reincarnation thats the word

Some people believe he said that we go on living in another body after death that we lived before They call it reincarnation That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet They say we have forgotten it Some say they remember their past lives

The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea Better remind her of the word metempsychosis An example would be better An example

The Bath of the Nymph over the bed Given away with the Easter number of Photo Bits Splendid masterpiece in art colours Tea before you put milk in Not unlike her with her hair down slimmer Three and six I gave for the frame She said it would look nice over the bed Naked nymphs Greece and for instance all the people that lived then

He turned the pages back

Metempsychosis he said is what the ancient Greeks called it They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree for instance What they called nymphs for example

Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar She gazed straight before her inhaling through her arched nostrils

Theres a smell of burn she said Did you leave anything on the fire

The kidney he cried suddenly

He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and stubbing his toes against the broken commode hurried out towards the smell stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried storks legs Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back Only a little burnt He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it

Cup of tea now He sat down cut and buttered a slice of the loaf He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat Then he put a forkful into his mouth chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat Done to a turn A mouthful of tea Then he cut away dies of bread sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth What was that about some young student and a picnic He creased out the letter at his side reading it slowly as he chewed sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth

Dearest Papli

Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present It suits me splendid Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam I got mummys lovely box of creams and am writing They are lovely I am getting on swimming in the photo business now Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs Will send when developed We did great biz yesterday Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks I hear them at the piano downstairs There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylans I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylans song about those seaside girls Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects I must now close with fondest love

                    Your fond daughter

                        Milly

P S Excuse bad writing am in hurry Byby

                        M

Fifteen yesterday Curious fifteenth of the month too Her first birthday away from home Separation Remember the summer morning she was born running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street Jolly old woman Lot of babies she must have helped into the world She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldnt live Well God is good sir She knew at once He would be eleven now if he had lived

His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript Excuse bad writing Hurry Piano downstairs Coming out of her shell Row with her in the XL Caf about the bracelet Wouldnt eat her cakes or speak or look Saucebox He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney Twelve and six a week Not much Still she might do worse Music hall stage Young student He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal Then he read the letter again twice

O well she knows how to mind herself But if not No nothing has happened Of course it might Wait in any case till it does A wild piece of goods Her slim legs running up the staircase Destiny Ripening now Vain very

He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red Anemic a little Was given milk too long On the Erins King that day round the Kish Damned old tub pitching about Not a bit funky Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair

All dimpled cheeks and curls
Your head it simply swirls

Seaside girls Torn envelope Hands stuck in his trousers pockets jarvey off for the day singing Friend of the family Swurls he says Pier with lamps summer evening band

Those girls those girls
Those lovely seaside girls

Milly too Young kisses the first Far away now past Mrs Marion Reading lying back now counting the strands of her hair smiling braiding

A soft qualm regret flowed down his backbone increasing Will happen yes Prevent Useless cant move Girls sweet light lips Will happen too He felt the flowing qualm spread over him Useless to move now Lips kissed kissing kissed Full gluey womans lips

Better where she is down there away Occupy her Wanted a dog to pass the time Might take a trip down there August bank holiday only two and six return Six weeks off however Might work a press pass Or through MCoy

The cat having cleaned all her fur returned to the meatstained paper nosed at it and stalked to the door She looked back at him mewing Wants to go out Wait before a door sometime it will open Let her wait Has the fidgets Electric Thunder in the air Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too

He felt heavy full then a gentle loosening of his bowels He stood up undoing the waistband of his trousers The cat mewed to him

Miaow he said in answer Wait till Im ready

Heaviness hot day coming Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing

A paper He liked to read at stool Hope no ape comes knocking just as Im

In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits He folded it under his armpit went to the door and opened it The cat went up in soft bounds Ah wanted to go upstairs curl up in a ball on the bed

Listening he heard her voice

Come come pussy Come

He went out through the backdoor into the garden stood to listen towards the next garden No sound Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry The maid was in the garden Fine morning

He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall Make a summerhouse here Scarlet runners Virginia creepers Want to manure the whole place over scabby soil A coat of liver of sulphur All soil like that without dung Household slops Loam what is this that is The hens in the next garden their droppings are very good top dressing Best of all though are the cattle especially when they are fed on those oilcakes Mulch of dung Best thing to clean ladies kid gloves Dirty cleans Ashes too Reclaim the whole place Grow peas in that corner there Lettuce Always have fresh greens then Still gardens have their drawbacks That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday

He walked on Where is my hat by the way Must have put it back on the peg Or hanging up on the floor Funny I dont remember that Hallstand too full Four umbrellas her raincloak Picking up the letters Dragos shopbell ringing Queer I was just thinking that moment Brown brillantined hair over his collar Just had a wash and brushup Wonder have I time for a bath this morning Tara street Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens they say OBrien

Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has Agendath what is it Now my miss Enthusiast

He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral He went in bowing his head under the low lintel Leaving the door ajar amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows The king was in his countinghouse Nobody

Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper turning its pages over on his bared knees Something new and easy No great hurry Keep it a bit Our prize titbit Matchams Masterstroke Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy Playgoers Club London Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer Three and a half Three pounds three Three pounds thirteen and six

Quietly he read restraining himself the first column and yielding but resisting began the second Midway his last resistance yielding he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone Hope its not too big bring on piles again No just right So Ah Costive One tabloid of cascara sagrada Life might be so It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat Print anything now Silly season He read on seated calm above his own rising smell Neat certainly Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now Begins and ends morally Hand in hand Smart He glanced back through what he had read and while feeling his water flow quietly he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds thirteen and six

Might manage a sketch By Mr and Mrs L M Bloom Invent a story for some proverb Which Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing Dislike dressing together Nicked myself shaving Biting her nether lip hooking the placket of her skirt Timing her 915 Did Roberts pay you yet 920 What had Gretta Conroy on 923 What possessed me to buy this comb 924 Im swelled after that cabbage A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot

Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf Morning after the bazaar dance when Mays band played Ponchiellis dance of the hours Explain that morning hours noon then evening coming on then night hours Washing her teeth That was the first night Her head dancing Her fansticks clicking Is that Boylan well off He has money Why I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing No use humming then Allude to it Strange kind of music that last night The mirror was in shadow She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub Peering into it Lines in her eyes It wouldnt pan out somehow

Evening hours girls in grey gauze Night hours then black with daggers and eyemasks Poetical idea pink then golden then grey then black Still true to life also Day then the night

He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it Then he girded up his trousers braced and buttoned himself He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air

In the bright light lightened and cooled in limb he eyed carefully his black trousers the ends the knees the houghs of the knees What time is the funeral Better find out in the paper

A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up The bells of Georges church They tolled the hour loud dark iron

Heigho Heigho
Heigho Heigho
Heigho Heigho

Quarter to There again the overtone following through the air A third

Poor Dignam

By lorries along sir John Rogersons quay Mr Bloom walked soberly past Windmill lane Leasks the linseed crusher the postal telegraph office Could have given that address too And past the sailors home He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street By Bradys cottages a boy for the skins lolled his bucket of offal linked smoking a chewed fagbutt A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him listlessly holding her battered caskhoop Tell him if he smokes he wont grow O let him His life isnt such a bed of roses Waiting outside pubs to bring da home Come home to ma da Slack hour wont be many there He crossed Townsend street passed the frowning face of Bethel El yes house of Aleph Beth And past Nichols the undertaker At eleven it is Time enough Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for ONeills Singing with his eyes shut Corny Met her once in the park In the dark What a lark Police tout Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay O surely he bagged it Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom

In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets choice blend finest quality family tea Rather warm Tea Must get some from Tom Kernan Couldnt ask him at a funeral though While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair Very warm morning Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha Just there His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket

So warm His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair Then he put on his hat again relieved and read again choice blend made of the finest Ceylon brands The far east Lovely spot it must be the garden of the world big lazy leaves to float about on cactuses flowery meads snaky lianas they call them Wonder is it like that Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente not doing a hands turn all day Sleep six months out of twelve Too hot to quarrel Influence of the climate Lethargy Flowers of idleness The air feeds most Azotes Hothouse in Botanic gardens Sensitive plants Waterlilies Petals too tired to Sleeping sickness in the air Walk on roseleaves Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere Ah yes in the dead sea floating on his back reading a book with a parasol open Couldnt sink if you tried so thick with salt Because the weight of the water no the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what Or is it the volume is equal to the weight Its a law something like that Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints teaching The college curriculum Cracking curriculum What is weight really when you say the weight Thirtytwo feet per second per second Law of falling bodies per second per second They all fall to the ground The earth Its the force of gravity of the earth is the weight

He turned away and sauntered across the road How did she walk with her sausages Like that something As he walked he took the folded Freeman from his sidepocket unfolded it rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg Careless air just drop in to see Per second per second Per second for every second it means From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice Too late box Post here Noone In

He handed the card through the brass grill

Are there any letters for me he asked

While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils smelling freshprinted rag paper No answer probably Went too far last time

The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope

Henry Flower Esq
co P O Westland Row
            City

Answered anyhow He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket reviewing again the soldiers on parade Wheres old Tweedys regiment Castoff soldier There bearskin cap and hackle plume No hes a grenadier Pointed cuffs There he is royal Dublin fusiliers Redcoats Too showy That must be why the women go after them Uniform Easier to enlist and drill Maud Gonnes letter about taking them off OConnell street at night disgrace to our Irish capital Griffiths paper is on the same tack now an army rotten with venereal disease overseas or halfseasover empire Half baked they look hypnotised like Eyes front Mark time Table able Bed ed The Kings own Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby A mason yes

He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right Talk as if that would mend matters His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope ripping it open in jerks Women will pay a lot of heed I dont think His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket Something pinned on photo perhaps Hair No

MCoy Get rid of him quickly Take me out of my way Hate company when you

Hello Bloom Where are you off to

Hello MCoy Nowhere in particular

Hows the body

Fine How are you

Just keeping alive MCoy said

His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect

Is there any no trouble I hope I see youre

O no Mr Bloom said Poor Dignam you know The funeral is today

To be sure poor fellow So it is What time

A photo it isnt A badge maybe

Eeleven Mr Bloom answered

I must try to get out there MCoy said Eleven is it I only heard it last night Who was telling me Holohan You know Hoppy

I know

Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor The porter hoisted the valise up on the well She stood still waiting while the man husband brother like her searched his pockets for change Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar warm for a day like this looks like blanketcloth Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets Like that haughty creature at the polo match Women all for caste till you touch the spot Handsome is and handsome does Reserved about to yield The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man Possess her once take the starch out of her

I was with Bob Doran hes on one of his periodical bends and what do you call him Bantam Lyons Just down there in Conways we were

Doran Lyons in Conways She raised a gloved hand to her hair In came Hoppy Having a wet Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare the braided drums Clearly I can see today Moisture about gives long sight perhaps Talking of one thing or another Ladys hand Which side will she get up

And he said Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy What Paddy I said Poor little Paddy Dignam he said

Off to the country Broadstone probably High brown boots with laces dangling Wellturned foot What is he foostering over that change for Sees me looking Eye out for other fellow always Good fallback Two strings to her bow

Why I said Whats wrong with him I said

Proud rich silk stockings

Yes Mr Bloom said

He moved a little to the side of MCoys talking head Getting up in a minute

Whats wrong with him He said Hes dead he said And faith he filled up Is it Paddy Dignam I said I couldnt believe it when I heard it I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch Yes he said Hes gone He died on Monday poor fellow

Watch Watch Silk flash rich stockings white Watch

A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between

Lost it Curse your noisy pugnose Feels locked out of it Paradise and the peri Always happening like that The very moment Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter Her friend covering the display of Esprit de corps Well what are you gaping at

Yes yes Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh Another gone

One of the best MCoy said

The tram passed They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge her rich gloved hand on the steel grip Flicker flicker the laceflare of her hat in the sun flicker flick

Wife well I suppose MCoys changed voice said

O yes Mr Bloom said Tiptop thanks

He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly

What is home without
Plumtrees Potted Meat
Incomplete
With it an abode of bliss

My missus has just got an engagement At least its not settled yet

Valise tack again By the way no harm Im off that thanks

Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness

My wife too he said Shes going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall Belfast on the twentyfifth

That so MCoy said Glad to hear that old man Whos getting it up

Mrs Marion Bloom Not up yet Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and No book Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens Dark lady and fair man Letter Cat furry black ball Torn strip of envelope

Loves
Old
Sweet
Song
Comes looves old

Its a kind of a tour dont you see Mr Bloom said thoughtfully Sweeeet song Theres a committee formed Part shares and part profits

MCoy nodded picking at his moustache stubble

O well he said Thats good news

He moved to go

Well glad to see you looking fit he said Meet you knocking around

Yes Mr Bloom said

Tell you what MCoy said You might put down my name at the funeral will you Id like to go but I mightnt be able you see Theres a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found You just shove in my name if Im not there will you

Ill do that Mr Bloom said moving to get off Thatll be all right

Right MCoy said brightly Thanks old man Id go if I possibly could Well tolloll Just C P MCoy will do

That will be done Mr Bloom answered firmly

Didnt catch me napping that wheeze The quick touch Soft mark Id like my job Valise I have a particular fancy for Leather Capped corners rivetted edges double action lever lock Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this

Mr Bloom strolling towards Brunswick street smiled My missus has just got an Reedy freckled soprano Cheeseparing nose Nice enough in its way for a little ballad No guts in it You and me dont you know in the same boat Softsoaping Give you the needle that would Cant he hear the difference Think hes that way inclined a bit Against my grain somehow Thought that Belfast would fetch him I hope that smallpox up there doesnt get worse Suppose she wouldnt let herself be vaccinated again Your wife and my wife

Wonder is he pimping after me

Mr Bloom stood at the corner his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings Cantrell and Cochranes Ginger Ale Aromatic Clerys Summer Sale No hes going on straight Hello Leah tonight Mrs Bandmann Palmer Like to see her again in that Hamlet she played last night Male impersonator Perhaps he was a woman Why Ophelia committed suicide Poor papa How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in Year before I was born that was sixtyfive And Ristori in Vienna What is this the right name is By Mosenthal it is Rachel is it No The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face

Nathans voice His sons voice I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms who left the house of his father and left the God of his father

Every word is so deep Leopold

Poor papa Poor man Im glad I didnt go into the room to look at his face That day O dear O dear Ffoo Well perhaps it was best for him

Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard No use thinking of it any more Nosebag time Wish I hadnt met that MCoy fellow

He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats the gently champing teeth Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss Their Eldorado Poor jugginses Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags Too full for words Still they get their feed all right and their doss Gelded too a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches Might be happy all the same that way Good poor brutes they look Still their neigh can be very irritating

He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried Might just walk into her here The lane is safer

He passed the cabmans shelter Curious the life of drifting cabbies All weathers all places time or setdown no will of their own Voglio e non Like to give them an odd cigarette Sociable Shout a few flying syllables as they pass He hummed

L ci darem la mano
La la lala la la

He turned into Cumberland street and going on some paces halted in the lee of the station wall Noone Meades timberyard Piled balks Ruins and tenements With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone Not a sinner Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles alone shooting the taw with a cunnythumb A wise tabby a blinking sphinx watched from her warm sill Pity to disturb them Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her Open it And once I played marbles when I went to that old dames school She liked mignonette Mrs Elliss And Mr He opened the letter within the newspaper

A flower I think its a A yellow flower with flattened petals Not annoyed then What does she say

Dear Henry

I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it I am sorry you did not like my last letter Why did you enclose the stamps I am awfully angry with you I do wish I could punish you for that I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy I do wish I could do something for you Please tell me what you think of poor me I often think of the beautiful name you have Dear Henry when will we meet I think of you so often you have no idea I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you I feel so bad about Please write me a long letter and tell me more Remember if you do not I will punish you So now you know what I will do to you you naughty boy if you do not wrote O how I long to meet you Henry dear do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted Then I will tell you all Goodbye now naughty darling I have such a bad headache today and write by return to your longing

Martha

P S Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use I want to know

He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket Language of flowers They like it because noone can hear Or a poison bouquet to strike him down Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again murmuring here and there a word Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you dont please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Marthas perfume Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket

Weak joy opened his lips Changed since the first letter Wonder did she wrote it herself Doing the indignant a girl of good family like me respectable character Could meet one Sunday after the rosary Thank you not having any Usual love scrimmage Then running round corners Bad as a row with Molly Cigar has a cooling effect Narcotic Go further next time Naughty boy punish afraid of words of course Brutal why not Try it anyhow A bit at a time

Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it Common pin eh He threw it on the road Out of her clothes somewhere pinned together Queer the number of pins they always have No roses without thorns

Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head Those two sluts that night in the Coombe linked together in the rain

O Mairy lost the pin of her drawers
She didnt know what to do
To keep it up
To keep it up

It Them Such a bad headache Has her roses probably Or sitting all day typing Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves What perfume does your wife use Now could you make out a thing like that

To keep it up

Martha Mary I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money He is sitting in their house talking Mysterious Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen

To keep it up

Nice kind of evening feeling No more wandering about Just loll there quiet dusk let everything rip Forget Tell about places you have been strange customs The other one jar on her head was getting the supper fruit olives lovely cool water out of a well stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches She listens with big dark soft eyes Tell her more and more all Then a sigh silence Long long long rest

Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road The shreds fluttered away sank in the dank air a white flutter then all sank

Henry Flower You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way Simple bit of paper Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland Shows you the money to be made out of porter Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day they say Skin breeds lice or vermin A million pounds wait a moment Twopence a pint fourpence a quart eightpence a gallon of porter no one and fourpence a gallon of porter One and four into twenty fifteen about Yes exactly Fifteen millions of barrels of porter

What am I saying barrels Gallons About a million barrels all the same

An incoming train clanked heavily above his head coach after coach Barrels bumped in his head dull porter slopped and churned inside The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out flowing together winding through mudflats all over the level land a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth

He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband Damn it I might have tried to work MCoy for a pass to Mullingar

Same notice on the door Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S J on saint Peter Claver S J and the African Mission Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious The protestants are the same Convert Dr William J Walsh DD to the true religion Save Chinas millions Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee Prefer an ounce of opium Celestials Rank heresy for them Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum Taking it easy with hand under his cheek Josssticks burning Not like Ecce Homo Crown of thorns and cross Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock Chopsticks Conmee Martin Cunningham knows him distinguishedlooking Sorry I didnt work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasnt Theyre taught that Hes not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks is he The glasses would take their fancy flashing Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips entranced listening Still life Lap it up like milk I suppose

The cold smell of sacred stone called him He trod the worn steps pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere

Something going on some sodality Pity so empty Nice discreet place to be next some girl Who is my neighbour Jammed by the hour to slow music That woman at midnight mass Seventh heaven Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks heads bowed A batch knelt at the altarrails The priest went along by them murmuring holding the thing in his hands He stopped at each took out a communion shook a drop or two are they in water off it and put it neatly into her mouth Her hat and head sank Then the next one Her hat sank at once Then the next one a small old woman The priest bent down to put it into her mouth murmuring all the time Latin The next one Shut your eyes and open your mouth What Corpus body Corpse Good idea the Latin Stupefies them first Hospice for the dying They dont seem to chew it only swallow it down Rum idea eating bits of a corpse Why the cannibals cotton to it

He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle one by one and seek their places He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner nursing his hat and newspaper These pots we have to wear We ought to have hats modelled on our heads They were about him here and there with heads still bowed in their crimson halters waiting for it to melt in their stomachs Something like those mazzoth its that sort of bread unleavened shewbread Look at them Now I bet it makes them feel happy Lollipop It does Yes bread of angels its called Theres a big idea behind it kind of kingdom of God is within you feel First communicants Hokypoky penny a lump Then feel all like one family party same in the theatre all in the same swim They do Im sure of that Not so lonely In our confraternity Then come out a bit spreeish Let off steam Thing is if you really believe in it Lourdes cure waters of oblivion and the Knock apparition statues bleeding Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox Hence those snores Blind faith Safe in the arms of kingdom come Lulls all pain Wake this time next year

He saw the priest stow the communion cup away well in and kneel an instant before it showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on Suppose he lost the pin of his He wouldnt know what to do to Bald spot behind Letters on his back INRI No IHS Molly told me one time I asked her I have sinned or no I have suffered it is And the other one Iron nails ran in

Meet one Sunday after the rosary Do not deny my request Turn up with a veil and black bag Dusk and the light behind her She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly Their character That fellow that turned queens evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the Carey was his name the communion every morning This very church Peter Carey yes No Peter Claver I am thinking of Denis Carey And just imagine that Wife and six children at home And plotting that murder all the time Those crawthumpers now thats a good name for them theres always something shiftylooking about them Theyre not straight men of business either O no shes not here the flower no no By the way did I tear up that envelope Yes under the bridge

The priest was rinsing out the chalice then he tossed off the dregs smartly Wine Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinnesss porter or some temperance beverage Wheatleys Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochranes ginger ale aromatic Doesnt give them any of it shew wine only the other Cold comfort Pious fraud but quite right otherwise theyd have one old booser worse than another coming along cadging for a drink Queer the whole atmosphere of the Quite right Perfectly right that is

Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir Not going to be any music Pity Who has the organ here I wonder Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk the vibrato fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street Molly was in fine voice that day the Stabat Mater of Rossini Father Bernard Vaughans sermon first Christ or Pilate Christ but dont keep us all night over it Music they wanted Footdrill stopped Could hear a pin drop I told her to pitch her voice against that corner I could feel the thrill in the air the full the people looking up

Quis est homo

Some of that old sacred music splendid Mercadante seven last words Mozarts twelfth mass Gloria in that Those old popes keen on music on art and statues and pictures of all kinds Palestrina for example too They had a gay old time while it lasted Healthy too chanting regular hours then brew liqueurs Benedictine Green Chartreuse Still having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick What kind of voice is it Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses Connoisseurs Suppose they wouldnt feel anything after Kind of a placid No worry Fall into flesh dont they Gluttons tall long legs Who knows Eunuch One way out of it

He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people All crossed themselves and stood up Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up looking over the risen hats Stand up at the gospel of course Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench The priest came down from the altar holding the thing out from him and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card

O God our refuge and our strength

Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words English Throw them the bone I remember slightly How long since your last mass Glorious and immaculate virgin Joseph her spouse Peter and Paul More interesting if you understood what it was all about Wonderful organisation certainly goes like clockwork Confession Everyone wants to Then I will tell you all Penance Punish me please Great weapon in their hands More than doctor or solicitor Woman dying to And I schschschschschsch And did you chachachachacha And why did you Look down at her ring to find an excuse Whispering gallery walls have ears Husband learn to his surprise Gods little joke Then out she comes Repentance skindeep Lovely shame Pray at an altar Hail Mary and Holy Mary Flowers incense candles melting Hide her blushes Salvation army blatant imitation Reformed prostitute will address the meeting How I found the Lord Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome they work the whole show And dont they rake in the money too Bequests also to the PP for the time being in his absolute discretion Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors Monasteries and convents The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the witnessbox No browbeating him He had his answer pat for everything Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church The doctors of the church they mapped out the whole theology of it

The priest prayed

Blessed Michael archangel defend us in the hour of conflict Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil may God restrain him we humbly pray and do thou O prince of the heavenly host by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls

The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off All over The women remained behind thanksgiving

Better be shoving along Brother Buzz Come around with the plate perhaps Pay your Easter duty

He stood up Hello Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time Women enjoy it Never tell you But we Excuse miss theres a whh just a whh fluff Or their skirt behind placket unhooked Glimpses of the moon Annoyed if you dont Why didnt you tell me before Still like you better untidy Good job it wasnt farther south He passed discreetly buttoning down the aisle and out through the main door into the light He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water Trams a car of Prescotts dyeworks a widow in her weeds Notice because Im in mourning myself He covered himself How goes the time Quarter past Time enough yet Better get that lotion made up Where is this Ah yes the last time Swenys in Lincoln place Chemists rarely move Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir Hamilton Longs founded in the year of the flood Huguenot churchyard near there Visit some day

He walked southward along Westland row But the recipe is in the other trousers O and I forgot that latchkey too Bore this funeral affair O well poor fellow its not his fault When was it I got it made up last Wait I changed a sovereign I remember First of the month it must have been or the second O he can look it up in the prescriptions book

The chemist turned back page after page Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have Shrunken skull And old Quest for the philosophers stone The alchemists Drugs age you after mental excitement Lethargy then Why Reaction A lifetime in a night Gradually changes your character Living all the day among herbs ointments disinfectants All his alabaster lilypots Mortar and pestle Aq Dist Fol Laur Te Virid Smell almost cure you like the dentists doorbell Doctor Whack He ought to physic himself a bit Electuary or emulsion The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck Simples Want to be careful Enough stuff here to chloroform you Test turns blue litmus paper red Chloroform Overdose of laudanum Sleeping draughts Lovephiltres Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough Clogs the pores or the phlegm Poisons the only cures Remedy where you least expect it Clever of nature

About a fortnight ago sir

Yes Mr Bloom said

He waited by the counter inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains

Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin Mr Bloom said and then orangeflower water

It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax

And white wax also he said

Brings out the darkness of her eyes Looking at me the sheet up to her eyes Spanish smelling herself when I was fixing the links in my cuffs Those homely recipes are often the best strawberries for the teeth nettles and rainwater oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk Skinfood One of the old queens sons duke of Albany was it had only one skin Leopold yes Three we have Warts bunions and pimples to make it worse But you want a perfume too What perfume does your Peau dEspagne That orangeflower water is so fresh Nice smell these soaps have Pure curd soap Time to get a bath round the corner Hammam Turkish Massage Dirt gets rolled up in your navel Nicer if a nice girl did it Also I think I Yes I Do it in the bath Curious longing I Water to water Combine business with pleasure Pity no time for massage Feel fresh then all the day Funeral be rather glum

Yes sir the chemist said That was two and nine Have you brought a bottle

No Mr Bloom said Make it up please Ill call later in the day and Ill take one of these soaps How much are they

Fourpence sir

Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils Sweet lemony wax

Ill take this one he said That makes three and a penny

Yes sir the chemist said You can pay all together sir when you come back

Good Mr Bloom said

He strolled out of the shop the newspaper baton under his armpit the coolwrappered soap in his left hand

At his armpit Bantam Lyons voice and hand said

Hello Bloom Whats the best news Is that todays Show us a minute

Shaved off his moustache again by Jove Long cold upper lip To look younger He does look balmy Younger than I am

Bantam Lyonss yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton Wants a wash too Take off the rough dirt Good morning have you used Pears soap Dandruff on his shoulders Scalp wants oiling

I want to see about that French horse thats running today Bantam Lyons said Where the bugger is it

He rustled the pleated pages jerking his chin on his high collar Barbers itch Tight collar hell lose his hair Better leave him the paper and get shut of him

You can keep it Mr Bloom said

Ascot Gold cup Wait Bantam Lyons muttered Half a mo Maximum the second

I was just going to throw it away Mr Bloom said

Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly

Whats that his sharp voice said

I say you can keep it Mr Bloom answered I was going to throw it away that moment

Bantam Lyons doubted an instant leering then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Blooms arms

Ill risk it he said Here thanks

He sped off towards Conways corner God speed scut

Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it smiling Silly lips of that chap Betting Regular hotbed of it lately Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence Raffle for large tender turkey Your Christmas dinner for threepence Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America Keeps a hotel now They never come back Fleshpots of Egypt

He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths Remind you of a mosque redbaked bricks the minarets College sports today I see He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot Damn bad ad Now if they had made it round like a wheel Then the spokes sports sports sports and the hub big college Something to catch the eye

Theres Hornblower standing at the porters lodge Keep him on hands might take a turn in there on the nod How do you do Mr Hornblower How do you do sir

Heavenly weather really If life was always like that Cricket weather Sit around under sunshades Over after over Out They cant play it here Duck for six wickets Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg Donnybrook fair more in their line And the skulls we were acracking when MCarthy took the floor Heatwave Wont last Always passing the stream of life which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all

Enjoy a bath now clean trough of water cool enamel the gentle tepid stream This is my body

He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full naked in a womb of warmth oiled by scented melting soap softly laved He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained buoyed lightly upward lemonyellow his navel bud of flesh and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands a languid floating flower

Martin Cunningham first poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and entering deftly seated himself Mr Power stepped in after him curving his height with care

Come on Simon

After you Mr Bloom said

Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in saying

Yes yes

Are we all here now Martin Cunningham asked Come along Bloom

Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue One dragged aside an old woman peeping Nose whiteflattened against the pane Thanking her stars she was passed over Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming Job seems to suit them Huggermugger in corners Slop about in slipperslappers for fear hed wake Then getting it ready Laying it out Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed Pull it more to your side Our windingsheet Never know who will touch you dead Wash and shampoo I believe they clip the nails and the hair Keep a bit in an envelope Grows all the same after Unclean job

All waited Nothing was said Stowing in the wreaths probably I am sitting on something hard Ah that soap in my hip pocket Better shift it out of that Wait for an opportunity

All waited Then wheels were heard from in front turning then nearer then horses hoofs A jolt Their carriage began to move creaking and swaying Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker door ajar At walking pace

They waited still their knees jogging till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks Tritonville road Quicker The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes

What way is he taking us Mr Power asked through both windows

Irishtown Martin Cunningham said Ringsend Brunswick street

Mr Dedalus nodded looking out

Thats a fine old custom he said I am glad to see it has not died out

All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers Respect The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man clad in mourning a wide hat

Theres a friend of yours gone by Dedalus he said

Who is that

Your son and heir

Where is he Mr Dedalus said stretching over across

The carriage passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses lurched round the corner and swerving back to the tramtrack rolled on noisily with chattering wheels Mr Dedalus fell back saying

Was that Mulligan cad with him His fidus Achates

No Mr Bloom said He was alone

Down with his aunt Sally I suppose Mr Dedalus said the Goulding faction the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie papas little lump of dung the wise child that knows her own father

Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road Wallace Bros the bottleworks Dodder bridge

Richie Goulding and the legal bag Goulding Collis and Ward he calls the firm His jokes are getting a bit damp Great card he was Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning the landladys two hats pinned on his head Out on the rampage all night Beginning to tell on him now that backache of his I fear Wife ironing his back Thinks hell cure it with pills All breadcrumbs they are About six hundred per cent profit

Hes in with a lowdown crowd Mr Dedalus snarled That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts His name stinks all over Dublin But with the help of God and His blessed mother Ill make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate Ill tickle his catastrophe believe you me

He cried above the clatter of the wheels

I wont have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son A counterjumpers son Selling tapes in my cousin Peter Paul MSwineys Not likely

He ceased Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Powers mild face and Martin Cunninghams eyes and beard gravely shaking Noisy selfwilled man Full of his son He is right Something to hand on If little Rudy had lived See him grow up Hear his voice in the house Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit My son Me in his eyes Strange feeling it would be From me Just a chance Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil And the sergeant grinning up She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched Give us a touch Poldy God Im dying for it How life begins

Got big then Had to refuse the Greystones concert My son inside her I could have helped him on in life I could Make him independent Learn German too

Are we late Mr Power asked

Ten minutes Martin Cunningham said looking at his watch

Molly Milly Same thing watered down Her tomboy oaths O jumping Jupiter Ye gods and little fishes Still shes a dear girl Soon be a woman Mullingar Dearest Papli Young student Yes yes a woman too Life life

The carriage heeled over and back their four trunks swaying

Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke Mr Power said

He might Mr Dedalus said if he hadnt that squint troubling him Do you follow me

He closed his left eye Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs

What is this he said in the name of God Crumbs

Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately Mr Power said

All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats Mr Dedalus twisting his nose frowned downward and said

Unless Im greatly mistaken What do you think Martin

It struck me too Martin Cunningham said

Mr Bloom set his thigh down Glad I took that bath Feel my feet quite clean But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better

Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly

After all he said its the most natural thing in the world

Did Tom Kernan turn up Martin Cunningham asked twirling the peak of his beard gently

Yes Mr Bloom answered Hes behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes

And Corny Kelleher himself Mr Power asked

At the cemetery Martin Cunningham said

I met MCoy this morning Mr Bloom said He said hed try to come

The carriage halted short

Whats wrong

Were stopped

Where are we

Mr Bloom put his head out of the window

The grand canal he said

Gasworks Whooping cough they say it cures Good job Milly never got it Poor children Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions Shame really Got off lightly with illnesses compared Only measles Flaxseed tea Scarlatina influenza epidemics Canvassing for death Dont miss this chance Dogs home over there Poor old Athos Be good to Athos Leopold is my last wish Thy will be done We obey them in the grave A dying scrawl He took it to heart pined away Quiet brute Old mens dogs usually are

A raindrop spat on his hat He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags Apart Curious Like through a colander I thought it would My boots were creaking I remember now

The weather is changing he said quietly

A pity it did not keep up fine Martin Cunningham said

Wanted for the country Mr Power said Theres the sun again coming out

Mr Dedalus peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun hurled a mute curse at the sky

Its as uncertain as a childs bottom he said

Were off again

The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard

Tom Kernan was immense last night he said And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face

O draw him out Martin Mr Power said eagerly Wait till you hear him Simon on Ben Dollards singing of The Croppy Boy

Immense Martin Cunningham said pompously His singing of that simple ballad Martin is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience

Trenchant Mr Power said laughing Hes dead nuts on that And the retrospective arrangement

Did you read Dan Dawsons speech Martin Cunningham asked

I did not then Mr Dedalus said Where is it

In the paper this morning

Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket That book I must change for her

No no Mr Dedalus said quickly Later on please

Mr Blooms glance travelled down the edge of the paper scanning the deaths Callan Coleman Dignam Fawcett Lowry Naumann Peake what Peake is that is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleynes no Sexton Urbright Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper Thanks to the Little Flower Sadly missed To the inexpressible grief of his Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness Months mind Quinlan On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy

It is now a month since dear Henry fled
To his home up above in the sky
While his family weeps and mourns his loss
Hoping some day to meet him on high

I tore up the envelope Yes Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath He patted his waistcoatpocket There all right Dear Henry fled Before my patience are exhausted

National school Meades yard The hazard Only two there now Nodding Full as a tick Too much bone in their skulls The other trotting round with a fare An hour ago I was passing there The jarvies raised their hats

A pointsmans back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Blooms window Couldnt they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier Well but that fellow would lose his job then Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention

Antient concert rooms Nothing on there A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet Not much grief there Quarter mourning People in law perhaps

They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Marks under the railway bridge past the Queens theatre in silence Hoardings Eugene Stratton Mrs Bandmann Palmer Could I go to see Leah tonight I wonder I said I Or the Lily of Killarney Elster Grimes Opera Company Big powerful change Wet bright bills for next week Fun on the Bristol Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety Have to stand a drink or two As broad as its long

Hes coming in the afternoon Her songs

Plastos Sir Philip Cramptons memorial fountain bust Who was he

How do you do Martin Cunningham said raising his palm to his brow in salute

He doesnt see us Mr Power said Yes he does How do you do

Who Mr Dedalus asked

Blazes Boylan Mr Power said There he is airing his quiff

Just that moment I was thinking

Mr Dedalus bent across to salute From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply spruce figure passed

Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand then those of his right hand The nails yes Is there anything more in him that they she sees Fascination Worst man in Dublin That keeps him alive They sometimes feel what a person is Instinct But a type like that My nails I am just looking at them well pared And after thinking alone Body getting a bit softy I would notice that from remembering What causes that I suppose the skin cant contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off But the shape is there The shape is there still Shoulders Hips Plump Night of the dance dressing Shift stuck between the cheeks behind

He clasped his hands between his knees and satisfied sent his vacant glance over their faces

Mr Power asked

How is the concert tour getting on Bloom

O very well Mr Bloom said I hear great accounts of it Its a good idea you see

Are you going yourself

Well no Mr Bloom said In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business You see the idea is to tour the chief towns What you lose on one you can make up on the other

Quite so Martin Cunningham said Mary Anderson is up there now

Have you good artists

Louis Werner is touring her Mr Bloom said O yes well have all topnobbers J C Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and The best in fact

And Madame Mr Power said smiling Last but not least

Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them Smith OBrien Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there Woman Must be his deathday For many happy returns The carriage wheeling by Farrells statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees

Oot a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares his mouth opening oot

Four bootlaces for a penny

Wonder why he was struck off the rolls Had his office in Hume street Same house as Mollys namesake Tweedy crown solicitor for Waterford Has that silk hat ever since Relics of old decency Mourning too Terrible comedown poor wretch Kicked about like snuff at a wake OCallaghan on his last legs

And Madame Twenty past eleven Up Mrs Fleming is in to clean Doing her hair humming voglio e non vorrei No vorrei e non Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split Mi trema un poco il Beautiful on that tre her voice is weeping tone A thrush A throstle There is a word throstle that expresses that

His eyes passed lightly over Mr Powers goodlooking face Greyish over the ears Madame smiling I smiled back A smile goes a long way Only politeness perhaps Nice fellow Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps Not pleasant for the wife Yet they say who was it told me there is no carnal You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick Yes it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak What is this she was Barmaid in Jurys Or the Moira was it

They passed under the hugecloaked Liberators form

Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power

Of the tribe of Reuben he said

A tall blackbearded figure bent on a stick stumping round the corner of Elverys Elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine

In all his pristine beauty Mr Power said

Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly

The devil break the hasp of your back

Mr Power collapsing in laughter shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Grays statue

We have all been there Martin Cunningham said broadly

His eyes met Mr Blooms eyes He caressed his beard adding

Well nearly all of us

Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions faces

Thats an awfully good one thats going the rounds about Reuben J and the son

About the boatman Mr Power asked

Yes Isnt it awfully good

What is that Mr Dedalus asked I didnt hear it

There was a girl in the case Mr Bloom began and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harms way but when they were both

What Mr Dedalus asked That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it

Yes Mr Bloom said They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown

Drown Barabbas Mr Dedalus cried I wish to Christ he did

Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils

No Mr Bloom said the son himself

Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely

Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey

For Gods sake Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright Is he dead

Dead Martin Cunningham cried Not he A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive Half the town was there

Yes Mr Bloom said But the funny part is

And Reuben J Martin Cunningham said gave the boatman a florin for saving his sons life

A stifled sigh came from under Mr Powers hand

O he did Martin Cunningham affirmed Like a hero A silver florin

Isnt it awfully good Mr Bloom said eagerly

One and eightpence too much Mr Dedalus said drily

Mr Powers choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage

Nelsons pillar

Eight plums a penny Eight for a penny

We had better look a little serious Martin Cunningham said

Mr Dedalus sighed

Ah then indeed he said poor little Paddy wouldnt grudge us a laugh Many a good one he told himself

The Lord forgive me Mr Power said wiping his wet eyes with his fingers Poor Paddy I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that Id be driving after him like this Hes gone from us

As decent a little man as ever wore a hat Mr Dedalus said He went very suddenly

Breakdown Martin Cunningham said Heart

He tapped his chest sadly

Blazing face redhot Too much John Barleycorn Cure for a red nose Drink like the devil till it turns adelite A lot of money he spent colouring it

Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension

He had a sudden death poor fellow he said

The best death Mr Bloom said

Their wide open eyes looked at him

No suffering he said A moment and all is over Like dying in sleep

Noone spoke

Dead side of the street this Dull business by day land agents temperance hotel Falconers railway guide civil service college Gills catholic club the industrious blind Why Some reason Sun or wind At night too Chummies and slaveys Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew Foundation stone for Parnell Breakdown Heart

White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner galloping A tiny coffin flashed by In a hurry to bury A mourning coach Unmarried Black for the married Piebald for bachelors Dun for a nun

Sad Martin Cunningham said A child

A dwarfs face mauve and wrinkled like little Rudys was Dwarfs body weak as putty in a whitelined deal box Burial friendly society pays Penny a week for a sod of turf Our Little Beggar Baby Meant nothing Mistake of nature If its healthy its from the mother If not from the man Better luck next time

Poor little thing Mr Dedalus said Its well out of it

The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square Rattle his bones Over the stones Only a pauper Nobody owns

In the midst of life Martin Cunningham said

But the worst of all Mr Power said is the man who takes his own life

Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly coughed and put it back

The greatest disgrace to have in the family Mr Power added

Temporary insanity of course Martin Cunningham said decisively We must take a charitable view of it

They say a man who does it is a coward Mr Dedalus said

It is not for us to judge Martin Cunningham said

Mr Bloom about to speak closed his lips again Martin Cunninghams large eyes Looking away now Sympathetic human man he is Intelligent Like Shakespeares face Always a good word to say They have no mercy on that here or infanticide Refuse christian burial They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave As if it wasnt broken already Yet sometimes they repent too late Found in the riverbed clutching rushes He looked at me And that awful drunkard of a wife of his Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost Leading him the life of the damned Wear the heart out of a stone that Monday morning Start afresh Shoulder to the wheel Lord she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there Drunk about the place and capering with Martins umbrella

And they call me the jewel of Asia
Of Asia
The geisha

He looked away from me He knows Rattle his bones

That afternoon of the inquest The redlabelled bottle on the table The room in the hotel with hunting pictures Stuffy it was Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind The coroners sunlit ears big and hairy Boots giving evidence Thought he was asleep first Then saw like yellow streaks on his face Had slipped down to the foot of the bed Verdict overdose Death by misadventure The letter For my son Leopold

No more pain Wake no more Nobody owns

The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street Over the stones

We are going the pace I think Martin Cunningham said

God grant he doesnt upset us on the road Mr Power said

I hope not Martin Cunningham said That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany The Gordon Bennett

Yes by Jove Mr Dedalus said That will be worth seeing faith

As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls Has anybody here seen Kelly Kay ee double ell wy Dead March from Saul Hes as bad as old Antonio He left me on my ownio Pirouette The Mater Misericordiae Eccles street My house down there Big place Ward for incurables there Very encouraging Our Ladys Hospice for the dying Deadhouse handy underneath Where old Mrs Riordan died They look terrible the women Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon Then the screen round her bed for her to die Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me Hes gone over to the lyingin hospital they told me From one extreme to the other

The carriage galloped round a corner stopped

Whats wrong now

A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows lowing slouching by on padded hoofs whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear

Emigrants Mr Power said

Huuuh the drovers voice cried his switch sounding on their flanks Huuuh out of that

Thursday of course Tomorrow is killing day Springers Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each For Liverpool probably Roastbeef for old England They buy up all the juicy ones And then the fifth quarter lost all that raw stuff hide hair horns Comes to a big thing in a year Dead meat trade Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries soap margarine Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla

The carriage moved on through the drove

I cant make out why the corporation doesnt run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays Mr Bloom said All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats

Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare Martin Cunningham said Quite right They ought to

Yes Mr Bloom said and another thing I often thought is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan you know Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams hearse and carriage and all Dont you see what I mean

O that be damned for a story Mr Dedalus said Pullman car and saloon diningroom

A poor lookout for Corny Mr Power added

Why Mr Bloom asked turning to Mr Dedalus Wouldnt it be more decent than galloping two abreast

Well theres something in that Mr Dedalus granted

And Martin Cunningham said we wouldnt have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphys and upset the coffin on to the road

That was terrible Mr Powers shocked face said and the corpse fell about the road Terrible

First round Dunphys Mr Dedalus said nodding Gordon Bennett cup

Praises be to God Martin Cunningham said piously

Bom Upset A coffin bumped out on to the road Burst open Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him Red face grey now Mouth fallen open Asking whats up now Quite right to close it Looks horrid open Then the insides decompose quickly Much better to close up all the orifices Yes also With wax The sphincter loose Seal up all

Dunphys Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right

Dunphys corner Mourning coaches drawn up drowning their grief A pause by the wayside Tiptop position for a pub Expect well pull up here on the way back to drink his health Pass round the consolation Elixir of life

But suppose now it did happen Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about He would and he wouldnt I suppose Depends on where The circulation stops Still some might ooze out of an artery It would be better to bury them in red a dark red

In silence they drove along Phibsborough road An empty hearse trotted by coming from the cemetery looks relieved

Crossguns bridge the royal canal

Water rushed roaring through the sluices A man stood on his dropping barge between clamps of turf On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse Aboard of the Bugabu

Their eyes watched him On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds over slime mudchoked bottles carrion dogs Athlone Mullingar Moyvalley I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal Or cycle down Hire some old crock safety Wren had one the other day at the auction but a ladys Developing waterways James MCanns hobby to row me oer the ferry Cheaper transit By easy stages Houseboats Camping out Also hearses To heaven by water Perhaps I will without writing Come as a surprise Leixlip Clonsilla Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin With turf from the midland bogs Salute He lifted his brown straw hat saluting Paddy Dignam

They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house Near it now

I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on Mr Power said

Better ask Tom Kernan Mr Dedalus said

How is that Martin Cunningham said Left him weeping I suppose

Though lost to sight Mr Dedalus said to memory dear

The carriage steered left for Finglas road

The stonecutters yard on the right Last lap Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared white sorrowful holding out calm hands knelt in grief pointing Fragments of shapes hewn In white silence appealing The best obtainable Thos H Dennany monumental builder and sculptor

Passed

On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary the sextons an old tramp sat grumbling emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot After lifes journey

Gloomy gardens then went by one by one gloomy houses

Mr Power pointed

That is where Childs was murdered he said The last house

So it is Mr Dedalus said A gruesome case Seymour Bushe got him off Murdered his brother Or so they said

The crown had no evidence Mr Power said

Only circumstantial Martin Cunningham added Thats the maxim of the law Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned

They looked Murderers ground It passed darkly Shuttered tenantless unweeded garden Whole place gone to hell Wrongfully condemned Murder The murderers image in the eye of the murdered They love reading about it Mans head found in a garden Her clothing consisted of How she met her death Recent outrage The weapon used Murderer is still at large Clues A shoelace The body to be exhumed Murder will out

Cramped in this carriage She mightnt like me to come that way without letting her know Must be careful about women Catch them once with their pants down Never forgive you after Fifteen

The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze Dark poplars rare white forms Forms more frequent white shapes thronged amid the trees white forms and fragments streaming by mutely sustaining vain gestures on the air

The felly harshed against the curbstone stopped Martin Cunningham put out his arm and wrenching back the handle shoved the door open with his knee He stepped out Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed

Change that soap now Mr Blooms hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket He stepped out of the carriage replacing the newspaper his other hand still held

Paltry funeral coach and three carriages Its all the same Pallbearers gold reins requiem mass firing a volley Pomp of death Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit Simnel cakes those are stuck together cakes for the dead Dogbiscuits Who ate them Mourners coming out

He followed his companions Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed Hynes walking after them Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths He handed one to the boy

Where is that childs funeral disappeared to

A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block The waggoner marching at their head saluted

Coffin now Got here before us dead as he is Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways Dull eye collar tight on his neck pressing on a bloodvessel or something Do they know what they cart out here every day Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day Then Mount Jerome for the protestants Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick Thousands every hour Too many in the world

Mourners came out through the gates woman and a girl Leanjawed harpy hard woman at a bargain her bonnet awry Girls face stained with dirt and tears holding the womans arm looking up at her for a sign to cry Fishs face bloodless and livid

The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates So much dead weight Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath First the stiff then the friends of the stiff Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths Who is that beside them Ah the brotherinlaw

All walked after

Martin Cunningham whispered

I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom

What Mr Power whispered How so

His father poisoned himself Martin Cunningham whispered Had the Queens hotel in Ennis You heard him say he was going to Clare Anniversary

O God Mr Power whispered First I heard of it Poisoned himself

He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinals mausoleum Speaking

Was he insured Mr Bloom asked

I believe so Mr Kernan answered But the policy was heavily mortgaged Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane

How many children did he leave

Five Ned Lambert says hell try to get one of the girls into Todds

A sad case Mr Bloom said gently Five young children

A great blow to the poor wife Mr Kernan added

Indeed yes Mr Bloom agreed

Has the laugh at him now

He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished She had outlived him Lost her husband More dead for her than for me One must outlive the other Wise men say There are more women than men in the world Condole with her Your terrible loss I hope youll soon follow him For Hindu widows only She would marry another Him No Yet who knows after Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died Drawn on a guncarriage Victoria and Albert Frogmore memorial mourning But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet Vain in her heart of hearts All for a shadow Consort not even a king Her son was the substance Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back waiting It never comes One must go first alone under the ground and lie no more in her warm bed

How are you Simon Ned Lambert said softly clasping hands Havent seen you for a month of Sundays

Never better How are all in Corks own town

I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday Ned Lambert said Same old six and eightpence Stopped with Dick Tivy

And how is Dick the solid man

Nothing between himself and heaven Ned Lambert answered

By the holy Paul Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder Dick Tivy bald

Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters Ned Lambert said pointing ahead A few bob a skull Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up

Yes yes Mr Dedalus said dubiously Is that the eldest boy in front

Yes Ned Lambert said with the wifes brother John Henry Menton is behind He put down his name for a quid

Ill engage he did Mr Dedalus said I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job John Henry is not the worst in the world

How did he lose it Ned Lambert asked Liquor what

Many a good mans fault Mr Dedalus said with a sigh

They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar Poor boy Was he there when the father Both unconscious Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time All he might have done I owe three shillings to OGrady Would he understand The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel Which end is his head

After a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners Always in front of us Corny Kelleher laying a wreath at each fore corner beckoned to the boy to kneel The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously

A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door The whitesmocked priest came after him tidying his stole with one hand balancing with the other a little book against his toads belly Wholl read the book I said the rook

They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak

Father Coffey I knew his name was like a coffin Dominenamine Bully about the muzzle he looks Bosses the show Muscular christian Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him priest Thou art Peter Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will With a belly on him like a poisoned pup Most amusing expressions that man finds Hhhn burst sideways

Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo Domine

Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin Requiem mass Crape weepers Blackedged notepaper Your name on the altarlist Chilly place this Want to feed well sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please Eyes of a toad too What swells him up that way Molly gets swelled after cabbage Air of the place maybe Looks full up of bad gas Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place Butchers for instance they get like raw beefsteaks Who was telling me Mervyn Browne Down in the vaults of saint Werburghs lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it Out it rushes blue One whiff of that and youre a goner

My kneecap is hurting me Ow Thats better

The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boys bucket and shook it over the coffin Then he walked to the other end and shook it again Then he came back and put it back in the bucket As you were before you rested Its all written down he has to do it

Et ne nos inducas in tentationem

The server piped the answers in the treble I often thought it would be better to have boy servants Up to fifteen or so After that of course 

Holy water that was I expect Shaking sleep out of it He must be fed up with that job shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over Every mortal day a fresh batch middleaged men old women children women dead in childbirth men with beards baldheaded businessmen consumptive girls with little sparrows breasts All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them sleep On Dignam now

In paradisum

Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise Says that over everybody Tiresome kind of a job But he has to say something

The priest closed his book and went off followed by the server Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in hoisted the coffin again carried it out and shoved it on their cart Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brotherinlaw All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres

The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo Lord I mustnt lilt here

The OConnell circle Mr Dedalus said about him

Mr Powers soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone

Hes at rest he said in the middle of his people old Dan O But his heart is buried in Rome How many broken hearts are buried here Simon

Her grave is over there Jack Mr Dedalus said Ill soon be stretched beside her Let Him take me whenever He likes

Breaking down he began to weep to himself quietly stumbling a little in his walk Mr Power took his arm

Shes better where she is he said kindly

I suppose so Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven

Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by

Sad occasions Mr Kernan began politely

Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head

The others are putting on their hats Mr Kernan said I suppose we can do so too We are the last This cemetery is a treacherous place

They covered their heads

The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly dont you think Mr Kernan said with reproof

Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes Secret eyes secretsearching Mason I think not sure Beside him again We are the last In the same boat Hope hell say something else

Mr Kernan added

The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler more impressive I must say

Mr Bloom gave prudent assent The language of course was another thing

Mr Kernan said with solemnity

I am the resurrection and the life That touches a mans inmost heart

It does Mr Bloom said

Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies No touching that Seat of the affections Broken heart A pump after all pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day One fine day it gets bunged up and there you are Lots of them lying around here lungs hearts livers Old rusty pumps damn the thing else The resurrection and the life Once you are dead you are dead That last day idea Knocking them all up out of their graves Come forth Lazarus And he came fifth and lost the job Get up Last day Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps Find damn all of himself that morning Pennyweight of powder in a skull Twelve grammes one pennyweight Troy measure

Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side

Everything went off A1 he said What

He looked on them from his drawling eye Policemans shoulders With your tooraloom tooraloom

As it should be Mr Kernan said

What Eh Corny Kelleher said

Mr Kernan assured him

Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan John Henry Menton asked I know his face

Ned Lambert glanced back

Bloom he said Madame Marion Tweedy that was is I mean the soprano Shes his wife

O to be sure John Henry Menton said I havent seen her for some time She was a finelooking woman I danced with her wait fifteen seventeen golden years ago at Mat Dillons in Roundtown And a good armful she was

He looked behind through the others

What is he he asked What does he do Wasnt he in the stationery line I fell foul of him one evening I remember at bowls

Ned Lambert smiled

Yes he was he said in Wisdom Helys A traveller for blottingpaper

In Gods name John Henry Menton said what did she marry a coon like that for She had plenty of game in her then

Has still Ned Lambert said He does some canvassing for ads

John Henry Mentons large eyes stared ahead

The barrow turned into a side lane A portly man ambushed among the grasses raised his hat in homage The gravediggers touched their caps

John OConnell Mr Power said pleased He never forgets a friend

Mr OConnell shook all their hands in silence Mr Dedalus said

I am come to pay you another visit

My dear Simon the caretaker answered in a low voice I dont want your custom at all

Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunninghams side puzzling two long keys at his back

Did you hear that one he asked them about Mulcahy from the Coombe

I did not Martin Cunningham said

They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles

They tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough One of the drunks spelt out the name Terence Mulcahy The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up

The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed He resumed

And after blinking up at the sacred figure Not a bloody bit like the man says he Thats not Mulcahy says he whoever done it

Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked

Thats all done with a purpose Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes

I know Hynes said I know that

To cheer a fellow up Martin Cunningham said Its pure goodheartedness damn the thing else

Mr Bloom admired the caretakers prosperous bulk All want to be on good terms with him Decent fellow John OConnell real good sort Keys like Keyess ad no fear of anyone getting out No passout checks Habeas corpus I must see about that ad after the funeral Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha Hope its not chucked in the dead letter office Be the better of a shave Grey sprouting beard Thats the first sign when the hairs come out grey And temper getting cross Silver threads among the grey Fancy being his wife Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl Come out and live in the graveyard Dangle that before her It might thrill her first Courting death Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel OConnell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark Will o the wisp Gas of graves Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all Women especially are so touchy Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep Have you ever seen a ghost Well I have It was a pitchdark night The clock was on the stroke of twelve Still theyd kiss all right if properly keyed up Whores in Turkish graveyards Learn anything if taken young You might pick up a young widow here Men like that Love among the tombstones Romeo Spice of pleasure In the midst of death we are in life Both ends meet Tantalising for the poor dead Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving Gnawing their vitals Desire to grig people Molly wanting to do it at the window Eight children he has anyway

He has seen a fair share go under in his time lying around him field after field Holy fields More room if they buried them standing Sitting or kneeling you couldnt Standing His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing All honeycombed the ground must be oblong cells And very neat he keeps it too trim grass and edgings His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome Well so it is Ought to be flowers of sleep Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me The Botanic Gardens are just over there Its the blood sinking in the earth gives new life Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy Every man his price Well preserved fat corpse gentleman epicure invaluable for fruit garden A bargain By carcass of William Wilkinson auditor and accountant lately deceased three pounds thirteen and six With thanks

I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure bones flesh nails Charnelhouses Dreadful Turning green and pink decomposing Rot quick in damp earth The lean old ones tougher Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy Then begin to get black black treacle oozing out of them Then dried up Deathmoths Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living Changing about Live for ever practically Nothing to feed on feed on themselves

But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots Soil must be simply swirling with them Your head it simply swurls Those pretty little seaside gurls He looks cheerful enough over it Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first Wonder how he looks at life Cracking his jokes too warms the cockles of his heart The one about the bulletin Spurgeon went to heaven 4 am this morning 11 pm closing time Not arrived yet Peter The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know whats in fashion A juicy pear or ladies punch hot strong and sweet Keep out the damp You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way Gravediggers in Hamlet Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart Darent joke about the dead for two years at least De mortuis nil nisi prius Go out of mourning first Hard to imagine his funeral Seems a sort of a joke Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer Gives you second wind New lease of life

How many have you for tomorrow the caretaker asked

Two Corny Kelleher said Half ten and eleven

The caretaker put the papers in his pocket The barrow had ceased to trundle The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole stepping with care round the graves The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink looping the bands round it

Burying him We come to bury Csar His ides of March or June He doesnt know who is here nor care Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh Now who is he Id like to know Now Id give a trifle to know who he is Always someone turns up you never dreamt of A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life Yes he could Still hed have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave We all do Only man buries No ants too First thing strikes anybody Bury the dead Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life Well then Friday buried him Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it

O poor Robinson Crusoe
How could you possibly do so

Poor Dignam His last lie on the earth in his box When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood All gnawed through They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding let it down that way Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellows Theyre so particular Lay me in my native earth Bit of clay from the holy land Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin I see what it means I see To protect him as long as possible even in the earth The Irishmans house is his coffin Embalming in catacombs mummies the same idea

Mr Bloom stood far back his hat in his hand counting the bared heads Twelve Im thirteen No The chap in the macintosh is thirteen Deaths number Where the deuce did he pop out of He wasnt in the chapel that Ill swear Silly superstition that about thirteen

Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit Tinge of purple I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west Dressy fellow he was once Used to change three suits in the day Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias Hello Its dyed His wife I forgot hes not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him

The coffin dived out of sight eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles They struggled up and out and all uncovered Twenty

Pause

If we were all suddenly somebody else

Far away a donkey brayed Rain No such ass Never see a dead one they say Shame of death They hide Also poor papa went away

Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper Whisper The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker Wellcut frockcoat Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next Well it is a long rest Feel no more Its the moment you feel Must be damned unpleasant Cant believe it at first Mistake must be someone else Try the house opposite Wait I wanted to I havent yet Then darkened deathchamber Light they want Whispering around you Would you like to see a priest Then rambling and wandering Delirium all you hid all your life The death struggle His sleep is not natural Press his lower eyelid Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since hes doomed Devil in that picture of sinners death showing him a woman Dying to embrace her in his shirt Last act of Lucia Shall I nevermore behold thee Bam He expires Gone at last People talk about you a bit forget you Dont forget to pray for him Remember him in your prayers Even Parnell Ivy day dying out Then they follow dropping into a hole one after the other

We are praying now for the repose of his soul Hoping youre well and not in hell Nice change of air Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory

Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself They say you do when you shiver in the sun Someone walking over it Callboys warning Near you Mine over there towards Finglas the plot I bought Mamma poor mamma and little Rudy

The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin Mr Bloom turned away his face And if he was alive all the time Whew By jingo that would be awful No no he is dead of course Of course he is dead Monday he died They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole Flag of distress Three days Rather long to keep them in summer Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure theres no

The clay fell softer Begin to be forgotten Out of sight out of mind

The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat Had enough of it The mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves Quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields

Hynes jotting down something in his notebook Ah the names But he knows them all No coming to me

I am just taking the names Hynes said below his breath What is your christian name Im not sure

L Mr Bloom said Leopold And you might put down MCoys name too He asked me to

Charley Hynes said writing I know He was on the Freeman once

So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne Good idea a postmortem for doctors Find out what they imagine they know He died of a Tuesday Got the run Levanted with the cash of a few ads Charley youre my darling That was why he asked me to O well does no harm I saw to that MCoy Thanks old chap much obliged Leave him under an obligation costs nothing

And tell us Hynes said do you know that fellow in the fellow was over there in the

He looked around

Macintosh Yes I saw him Mr Bloom said Where is he now

MIntosh Hynes said scribbling I dont know who he is Is that his name

He moved away looking about him

No Mr Bloom began turning and stopping I say Hynes

Didnt hear What Where has he disappeared to Not a sign Well of all the Has anybody here seen Kay ee double ell Become invisible Good Lord what became of him

A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade

O excuse me

He stepped aside nimbly

Clay brown damp began to be seen in the hole It rose Nearly over A mound of damp clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades All uncovered again for a few instants The boy propped his wreath against a corner the brotherinlaw his on a lump The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass One leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband His navelcord The brotherinlaw turning away placed something in his free hand Thanks in silence Sorry sir trouble Headshake I know that For yourselves just

The mourners moved away slowly without aim by devious paths staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb

Let us go round by the chiefs grave Hynes said We have time

Let us Mr Power said

They turned to the right following their slow thoughts With awe Mr Powers blank voice spoke

Some say he is not in that grave at all That the coffin was filled with stones That one day he will come again

Hynes shook his head

Parnell will never come again he said Hes there all that was mortal of him Peace to his ashes

Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels crosses broken pillars family vaults stone hopes praying with upcast eyes old Irelands hearts and hands More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living Pray for the repose of the soul of Does anybody really Plant him and have done with him Like down a coalshoot Then lump them together to save time All souls day Twentyseventh Ill be at his grave Ten shillings for the gardener He keeps it free of weeds Old man himself Bent down double with his shears clipping Near deaths door Who passed away Who departed this life As if they did it of their own accord Got the shove all of them Who kicked the bucket More interesting if they told you what they were So and So wheelwright I travelled for cork lino I paid five shillings in the pound Or a womans with her saucepan I cooked good Irish stew Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell Entered into rest the protestants put it Old Dr Murrens The great physician called him home Well its Gods acre for them Nice country residence Newly plastered and painted Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times Marriage ads they never try to beautify Rusty wreaths hung on knobs garlands of bronzefoil Better value that for the money Still the flowers are more poetical The other gets rather tiresome never withering Expresses nothing Immortelles

A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch Like stuffed Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us Hoo Not a budge out of him Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him Dead animal even sadder SillyMilly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave

The Sacred Heart that is showing it Heart on his sleeve Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that Seems anything but pleased Why this infliction Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy Apollo that was

How many All these here once walked round Dublin Faithful departed As you are now so once were we

Besides how could you remember everybody Eyes walk voice Well the voice yes gramophone Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house After dinner on a Sunday Put on poor old greatgrandfather Kraahraark Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face Otherwise you couldnt remember the face after fifteen years say For instance who For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Helys

Rtststr A rattle of pebbles Wait Stop

He looked down intently into a stone crypt Some animal Wait There he goes

An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt moving the pebbles An old stager greatgrandfather he knows the ropes The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth wriggled itself in under it Good hidingplace for treasure

Who lives there Are laid the remains of Robert Emery Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight wasnt he Making his rounds

Tail gone now

One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow Pick the bones clean no matter who it was Ordinary meat for them A corpse is meat gone bad Well and whats cheese Corpse of milk I read in that Voyages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse Cremation better Priests dead against it Devilling for the other firm Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers Time of the plague Quicklime feverpits to eat them Lethal chamber Ashes to ashes Or bury at sea Where is that Parsee tower of silence Eaten by birds Earth fire water Drowning they say is the pleasantest See your whole life in a flash But being brought back to life no Cant bury in the air however Out of a flying machine Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down Underground communication We learned that from them Wouldnt be surprised Regular square feed for them Flies come before hes well dead Got wind of Dignam They wouldnt care about the smell of it Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse smell taste like raw white turnips

The gates glimmered in front still open Back to the world again Enough of this place Brings you a bit nearer every time Last time I was here was Mrs Sinicos funeral Poor papa too The love that kills And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores Give you the creeps after a bit I will appear to you after death You will see my ghost after death My ghost will haunt you after death There is another world after death named hell I do not like that other world she wrote No more do I Plenty to see and hear and feel yet Feel live warm beings near you Let them sleep in their maggoty beds They are not going to get me this innings Warm beds warm fullblooded life

Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath talking gravely

Solicitor I think I know his face Menton John Henry solicitor commissioner for oaths and affidavits Dignam used to be in his office Mat Dillons long ago Jolly Mat Convivial evenings Cold fowl cigars the Tantalus glasses Heart of gold really Yes Menton Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him Pure fluke of mine the bias Why he took such a rooted dislike to me Hate at first sight Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree laughing Fellow always like that mortified if women are by

Got a dinge in the side of his hat Carriage probably

Excuse me sir Mr Bloom said beside them

They stopped

Your hat is a little crushed Mr Bloom said pointing

John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving

There Martin Cunningham helped pointing also

John Henry Menton took off his hat bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve He clapped the hat on his head again

Its all right now Martin Cunningham said

John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment

Thank you he said shortly

They walked on towards the gates Mr Bloom chapfallen drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear Martin laying down the law Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger without his seeing it

Oyster eyes Never mind Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him Get the pull over him that way

Thank you How grand we are this morning

There it is Red Murray said Alexander Keyes

Just cut it out will you Mr Bloom said and Ill take it round to the Telegraph office

The door of Ruttledges office creaked again Davy Stephens minute in a large capecoat a small felt hat crowning his ringlets passed out with a roll of papers under his cape a kings courier

Red Murrays long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes Scissors and paste

Ill go through the printingworks Mr Bloom said taking the cut square

Of course if he wants a par Red Murray said earnestly a pen behind his ear we can do him one

Right Mr Bloom said with a nod Ill rub that in

WILLIAM BRAYDEN ESQUIRE OF OAKLANDS SANDYMOUNT

Red Murray touched Mr Blooms arm with the shears and whispered

Brayden

Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the Weekly Freeman and National Press and the Freemans Journal and National Press Dullthudding Guinnesss barrels It passed statelily up the staircase steered by an umbrella a solemn beardframed face The broadcloth back ascended each step back All his brains are in the nape of his neck Simon Dedalus says Welts of flesh behind on him Fat folds of neck fat neck fat neck

Dont you think his face is like Our Saviour Red Murray whispered

The door of Ruttledges office whispered ee cree They always build one door opposite another for the wind to Way in Way out

Our Saviour beardframed oval face talking in the dusk Mary Martha Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights Mario the tenor

Or like Mario Mr Bloom said

Yes Red Murray agreed But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour

Jesusmario with rougy cheeks doublet and spindle legs Hand on his heart In Martha

Coome thou lost one
Coome thou dear one
THE CROZIER AND THE PEN

His grace phoned down twice this morning Red Murray said gravely

They watched the knees legs boots vanish Neck

A telegram boy stepped in nimbly threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word

Freeman

Mr Bloom said slowly

Well he is one of our saviours also

A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage along the now reverberating boards But will he save the circulation Thumping Thumping

He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered stepping over strewn packing paper Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannettis reading closet
WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS

Hynes here too account of the funeral probably Thumping Thump This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam Machines Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught Rule the world today His machineries are pegging away too Like these got out of hand fermenting Working away tearing away And that old grey rat tearing to get in
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT

Mr Bloom halted behind the foremans spare body admiring a glossy crown

Strange he never saw his real country Ireland my country Member for College green He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth Its the ads and side features sell a weekly not the stale news in the official gazette Queen Anne is dead Published by authority in the year one thousand and Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis barony of Tinnahinch To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina Nature notes Cartoons Phil Blakes weekly Pat and Bull story Uncle Tobys page for tiny tots Country bumpkins queries Dear Mr Editor what is a good cure for flatulence Id like that part Learn a lot teaching others The personal note M A P Mainly all pictures Shapely bathers on golden strand Worlds biggest balloon Double marriage of sisters celebrated Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other Cuprani too printer More Irish than the Irish

The machines clanked in threefour time Thump thump thump Now if he got paralysed there and noone knew how to stop them theyd clank on and on the same print it over and over and up and back Monkeydoodle the whole thing Want a cool head

Well get it into the evening edition councillor Hynes said

Soon be calling him my lord mayor Long John is backing him they say

The foreman without answering scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen

Right thanks Hynes said moving off

Mr Bloom stood in his way

If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch he said pointing backward with his thumb

Did you Hynes asked

Mm Mr Bloom said Look sharp and youll catch him

Thanks old man Hynes said Ill tap him too

He hurried on eagerly towards the Freemans Journal

Three bob I lent him in Meaghers Three weeks Third hint
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK

Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannettis desk

Excuse me councillor he said This ad you see Keyes you remember

Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded

He wants it in for July Mr Bloom said

The foreman moved his pencil towards it

But wait Mr Bloom said He wants it changed Keyes you see He wants two keys at the top

Hell of a racket they make He doesnt hear it Nannan Iron nerves Maybe he understands what I

The foreman turned round to hear patiently and lifting an elbow began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket

Like that Mr Bloom said crossing his forefingers at the top

Let him take that in first

Mr Bloom glancing sideways up from the cross he had made saw the foremans sallow face think he has a touch of jaundice and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper Clank it Clank it Miles of it unreeled What becomes of it after O wrap up meat parcels various uses thousand and one things

Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork
HOUSE OF KEYES

Like that see Two crossed keys here A circle Then here the name Alexander Keyes tea wine and spirit merchant So on

Better not teach him his own business

You know yourself councillor just what he wants Then round the top in leaded the house of keys You see Do you think thats a good idea

The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly

The idea Mr Bloom said is the house of keys You know councillor the Manx parliament Innuendo of home rule Tourists you know from the isle of Man Catches the eye you see Can you do that

I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio But then if he didnt know only make it awkward for him Better not

We can do that the foreman said Have you the design

I can get it Mr Bloom said It was in a Kilkenny paper He has a house there too Ill just run out and ask him Well you can do that and just a little par calling attention You know the usual Highclass licensed premises Longfelt want So on

The foreman thought for an instant

We can do that he said Let him give us a three months renewal

A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage He began to check it silently Mr Bloom stood by hearing the loud throbs of cranks watching the silent typesetters at their cases
ORTHOGRAPHICAL

Want to be sure of his spelling Proof fever Martin Cunningham forgot to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning It is amusing to view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it double ess ment of a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear under a cemetery wall Silly isnt it Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry

I should have said when he clapped on his topper Thank you I ought to have said something about an old hat or something No I could have said Looks as good as new now See his phiz then

Sllt The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers Sllt Almost human the way it sllt to call attention Doing its level best to speak That door too sllt creaking asking to be shut Everything speaks in its own way Sllt
NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR

The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly saying

Wait Wheres the archbishops letter Its to be repeated in the Telegraph Wheres whats his name

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines

Monks sir a voice asked from the castingbox

Ay Wheres Monks

Monks

Mr Bloom took up his cutting Time to get out

Then Ill get the design Mr Nannetti he said and youll give it a good place I know

Monks

Yes sir

Three months renewal Want to get some wind off my chest first Try it anyhow Rub in August good idea horseshow month Ballsbridge Tourists over for the show
A DAYFATHER

He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man bowed spectacled aproned Old Monks the dayfather Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time obituary notices pubs ads speeches divorce suits found drowned Nearing the end of his tether now Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank Id say Wife a good cook and washer Daughter working the machine in the parlour Plain Jane no damn nonsense
AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER

He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type Reads it backwards first Quickly he does it Must require some practice that mangiD kcirtaP Poor papa with his hagadah book reading backwards with his finger to me Pessach Next year in Jerusalem Dear O dear All that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage alleluia Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu No thats the other Then the twelve brothers Jacobs sons And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well Justice it means but its everybody eating everyone else Thats what life is after all How quickly he does that job Practice makes perfect Seems to see with his fingers

Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps Better phone him up first Number Yes Same as Citrons house Twentyeight Twentyeight double four
ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP

He went down the house staircase Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches Looks as if they did it for a bet Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works Lukewarm glue in Thoms next door when I was there

He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose Citronlemon Ah the soap I put there Lose it out of that pocket Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away buttoned into the hip pocket of his trousers

What perfume does your wife use I could go home still tram something I forgot Just to see before dressing No Here No

A sudden screech of laughter came from the Evening Telegraph office Know who that is Whats up Pop in a minute to phone Ned Lambert it is

He entered softly
ERIN GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA

The ghost walks professor MacHugh murmured softly biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane

Mr Dedalus staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lamberts quizzing face asked of it sourly

Agonising Christ wouldnt it give you a heartburn on your arse

Ned Lambert seated on the table read on

Or again note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way tho quarrelling with the stony obstacles to the tumbling waters of Neptunes blue domain mid mossy banks fanned by gentlest zephyrs played on by the glorious sunlight or neath the shadows cast oer its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest What about that Simon he asked over the fringe of his newspaper Hows that for high

Changing his drink Mr Dedalus said

Ned Lambert laughing struck the newspaper on his knees repeating

The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage O boys O boys

And Xenophon looked upon Marathon Mr Dedalus said looking again on the fireplace and to the window and Marathon looked on the sea

That will do professor MacHugh cried from the window I dont want to hear any more of the stuff

He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and hungered made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand

High falutin stuff Bladderbags Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see Rather upsets a mans day a funeral does He has influence they say Old Chatterton the vicechancellor is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle Close on ninety they say Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps Living to spite them Might go first himself Johnny make room for your uncle The right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days Windfall when he kicks out Alleluia

Just another spasm Ned Lambert said

What is it Mr Bloom asked

A recently discovered fragment of Cicero professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone Our lovely land
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT

Whose land Mr Bloom said simply

Most pertinent question the professor said between his chews With an accent on the whose

Dan Dawsons land Mr Dedalus said

Is it his speech last night Mr Bloom asked

Ned Lambert nodded

But listen to this he said

The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in

Excuse me J J OMolloy said entering

Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside

I beg yours he said

Good day Jack

Come in Come in

Good day

How are you Dedalus

Well And yourself

J J OMolloy shook his head
SAD

Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be Decline poor chap That hectic flush spells finis for a man Touch and go with him Whats in the wind I wonder Money worry

Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks

Youre looking extra

Is the editor to be seen J J OMolloy asked looking towards the inner door

Very much so professor MacHugh said To be seen and heard Hes in his sanctum with Lenehan

J J OMolloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file

Practice dwindling A mighthavebeen Losing heart Gambling Debts of honour Reaping the whirlwind Used to get good retainers from D and T Fitzgerald Their wigs to show the grey matter Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin Believe he does some literary work for the Express with Gabriel Conroy Wellread fellow Myles Crawford began on the Independent Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening Weathercocks Hot and cold in the same breath Wouldnt know which to believe One story good till you hear the next Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over Hail fellow well met the next moment

Ah listen to this for God sake Ned Lambert pleaded Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks

Bombast the professor broke in testily Enough of the inflated windbag

Peaks Ned Lambert went on towering high on high to bathe our souls as it were

Bathe his lips Mr Dedalus said Blessed and eternal God Yes Is he taking anything for it

As twere in the peerless panorama of Irelands portfolio unmatched despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions for very beauty of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight
HIS NATIVE DORIC

The moon professor MacHugh said He forgot Hamlet

That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence

O Mr Dedalus cried giving vent to a hopeless groan Shite and onions Thatll do Ned Life is too short

He took off his silk hat and blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache welshcombed his hair with raking fingers

Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside chuckling with delight An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHughs unshaven blackspectacled face

Doughy Daw he cried
WHAT WETHERUP SAID

All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff He was in the bakery line too wasnt he Why they call him Doughy Daw Feathered his nest well anyhow Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor Hooked that nicely Entertainments Open house Big blowout Wetherup always said that Get a grip of them by the stomach

The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face crested by a comb of feathery hair thrust itself in The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked

What is it

And here comes the sham squire himself professor MacHugh said grandly

Getonouthat you bloody old pedagogue the editor said in recognition

Come Ned Mr Dedalus said putting on his hat I must get a drink after that

Drink the editor cried No drinks served before mass

Quite right too Mr Dedalus said going out Come on Ned

Ned Lambert sidled down from the table The editors blue eyes roved towards Mr Blooms face shadowed by a smile

Will you join us Myles Ned Lambert asked
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED

North Cork militia the editor cried striding to the mantelpiece We won every time North Cork and Spanish officers

Where was that Myles Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps

In Ohio the editor shouted

So it was begad Ned Lambert agreed

Passing out he whispered to J J OMolloy

Incipient jigs Sad case

Ohio the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face My Ohio

A perfect cretic the professor said Long short and long
O HARP EOLIAN

He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and breaking off a piece twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth

Bingbang bangbang

Mr Bloom seeing the coast clear made for the inner door

Just a moment Mr Crawford he said I just want to phone about an ad

He went in

What about that leader this evening professor MacHugh asked coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder

Thatll be all right Myles Crawford said more calmly Never you fret Hello Jack Thats all right

Good day Myles J J OMolloy said letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file Is that Canada swindle case on today

The telephone whirred inside

Twentyeight No twenty Double four Yes
SPOT THE WINNER

Lenehan came out of the inner office with Sports tissues

Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup he asked Sceptre with O Madden up

He tossed the tissues on to the table

Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open

Hush Lenehan said I hear feetstoops

Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps The tissues rustled up in the draught floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth

It wasnt me sir It was the big fellow shoved me sir

Throw him out and shut the door the editor said Theres a hurricane blowing

Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor grunting as he stooped twice

Waiting for the racing special sir the newsboy said It was Pat Farrell shoved me sir

He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe

Him sir

Out of this with you professor MacHugh said gruffly

He hustled the boy out and banged the door to

J J OMolloy turned the files crackingly over murmuring seeking

Continued on page six column four

Yes Evening Telegraph here Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office Is the boss Yes Telegraph To where Aha Which auction rooms Aha I see Right Ill catch him
A COLLISION ENSUES

The bell whirred again as he rang off He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue

Pardon monsieur Lenehan said clutching him for an instant and making a grimace

My fault Mr Bloom said suffering his grip Are you hurt Im in a hurry

Knee Lenehan said

He made a comic face and whined rubbing his knee

The accumulation of the anno Domini

Sorry Mr Bloom said

He went to the door and holding it ajar paused J J OMolloy slapped the heavy pages over The noise of two shrill voices a mouthorgan echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps

We are the boys of Wexford
Who fought with heart and hand
EXIT BLOOM

Im just running round to Bachelors walk Mr Bloom said about this ad of Keyess Want to fix it up They tell me hes round there in Dillons

He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces The editor who leaning against the mantelshelf had propped his head on his hand suddenly stretched forth an arm amply

Begone he said The world is before you

Back in no time Mr Bloom said hurrying out

J J OMolloy took the tissues from Lenehans hand and read them blowing them apart gently without comment

Hell get that advertisement the professor said staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind Look at the young scamps after him

Show Where Lenehan cried running to the window
A STREET CORTGE

Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Blooms wake the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite a tail of white bowknots

Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry Lenehan said and youll kick O my rib risible Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk Small nines Steal upon larks

He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J J OMolloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands

Whats that Myles Crawford said with a start Where are the other two gone

Who the professor said turning Theyre gone round to the Oval for a drink Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall Came over last night

Come on then Myles Crawford said Wheres my hat

He walked jerkily into the office behind parting the vent of his jacket jingling his keys in his back pocket They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer

Hes pretty well on professor MacHugh said in a low voice

Seems to be J J OMolloy said taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation but it is not always as it seems Who has the most matches
THE CALUMET OF PEACE

He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn J J OMolloy opened his case again and offered it

Thanky vous Lenehan said helping himself

The editor came from the inner office a straw hat awry on his brow He declaimed in song pointing sternly at professor MacHugh

Twas rank and fame that tempted thee
Twas empire charmed thy heart

The professor grinned locking his long lips

Eh You bloody old Roman empire Myles Crawford said

He took a cigarette from the open case Lenehan lighting it for him with quick grace said

Silence for my brandnew riddle

Imperium romanum J J OMolloy said gently It sounds nobler than British or Brixton The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire

Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling

Thats it he said We are the fat You and I are the fat in the fire We havent got the chance of a snowball in hell
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME

Wait a moment professor MacHugh said raising two quiet claws We mustnt be led away by words by sounds of words We think of Rome imperial imperious imperative

He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs pausing

What was their civilisation Vast I allow but vile Cloacae sewers The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said It is meet to be here Let us build an altar to Jehovah The Roman like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps brought to every new shore on which he set his foot on our shore he never set it only his cloacal obsession He gazed about him in his toga and he said It is meet to be here Let us construct a watercloset

Which they accordingly did do Lenehan said Our old ancient ancestors as we read in the first chapter of Guinnesss were partial to the running stream

They were natures gentlemen J J OMolloy murmured But we have also Roman law

And Pontius Pilate is its prophet professor MacHugh responded

Do you know that story about chief baron Palles J J OMolloy asked It was at the royal university dinner Everything was going swimmingly 

First my riddle Lenehan said Are you ready

Mr OMadden Burke tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed came in from the hallway Stephen Dedalus behind him uncovered as he entered

Entrez mes enfants Lenehan cried

I escort a suppliant Mr OMadden Burke said melodiously Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety

How do you do the editor said holding out a hand Come in Your governor is just gone


Lenehan said to all

Silence What opera resembles a railwayline Reflect ponder excogitate reply

Stephen handed over the typed sheets pointing to the title and signature

Who the editor asked

Bit torn off

Mr Garrett Deasy Stephen said

That old pelters the editor said Who tore it Was he short taken

On swift sail flaming
From storm and south
He comes pale vampire
Mouth to my mouth

Good day Stephen the professor said coming to peer over their shoulders Foot and mouth Are you turned

Bullockbefriending bard
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT

Good day sir Stephen answered blushing The letter is not mine Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to

O I know him Myles Crawford said and I knew his wife too The bloodiest old tartar God ever made By Jesus she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake The night she threw the soup in the waiters face in the Star and Garter Oho

A woman brought sin into the world For Helen the runaway wife of Menelaus ten years the Greeks ORourke prince of Breffni

Is he a widower Stephen asked

Ay a grass one Myles Crawford said his eye running down the typescript Emperors horses Habsburg An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna Dont you forget Maximilian Karl ODonnell graf von Tirconnell in Ireland Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now Going to be trouble there one day Wild geese O yes every time Dont you forget that

The moot point is did he forget it J J OMolloy said quietly turning a horseshoe paperweight Saving princes is a thank you job

Professor MacHugh turned on him

And if not he said

Ill tell you how it was Myles Crawford began A Hungarian it was one day
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED

We were always loyal to lost causes the professor said Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination We were never loyal to the successful We serve them I teach the blatant Latin language I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim time is money Material domination Dominus Lord Where is the spirituality Lord Jesus Lord Salisbury A sofa in a westend club But the Greek
KYRIE ELEISON

A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes lengthened his long lips

The Greek he said again Kyrios Shining word The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not Kyrie The radiance of the intellect I ought to profess Greek the language of the mind Kyrie eleison The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit not an imperium that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami Yes yes They went under Pyrrhus misled by an oracle made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece Loyal to a lost cause

He strode away from them towards the window

They went forth to battle Mr OMadden Burke said greyly but they always fell

Boohoo Lenehan wept with a little noise Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the matine Poor poor poor Pyrrhus

He whispered then near Stephens ear
LENEHANS LIMERICK

Theres a ponderous pundit MacHugh
Who wears goggles of ebony hue
As he mostly sees double
To wear them why trouble
I cant see the Joe Miller Can you

In mourning for Sallust Mulligan says Whose mother is beastly dead

Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket

Thatll be all right he said Ill read the rest after Thatll be all right

Lenehan extended his hands in protest

But my riddle he said What opera is like a railwayline

Opera Mr OMadden Burkes sphinx face reriddled

Lenehan announced gladly

The Rose of Castile See the wheeze Rows of cast steel Gee

He poked Mr OMadden Burke mildly in the spleen Mr OMadden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella feigning a gasp

Help he sighed I feel a strong weakness

Lenehan rising to tiptoe fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues

The professor returning by way of the files swept his hand across Stephens and Mr OMadden Burkes loose ties

Paris past and present he said You look like communards

Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile J J OMolloy said in quiet mockery Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you You look as though you had done the deed General Bobrikoff
OMNIUM GATHERUM

We were only thinking about it Stephen said

All the talents Myles Crawford said Law the classics

The turf Lenehan put in

Literature the press

If Bloom were here the professor said The gentle art of advertisement

And Madam Bloom Mr OMadden Burke added The vocal muse Dublins prime favourite

Lenehan gave a loud cough

Ahem he said very softly O for a fresh of breath air I caught a cold in the park The gate was open
YOU CAN DO IT

The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephens shoulder

I want you to write something for me he said Something with a bite in it You can do it I see it in your face In the lexicon of youth

See it in your face See it in your eye Lazy idle little schemer

Foot and mouth disease the editor cried in scornful invective Great nationalist meeting in BorrisinOssory All balls Bulldosing the public Give them something with a bite in it Put us all into it damn its soul Father Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes MCarthy

We can all supply mental pabulum Mr OMadden Burke said

Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare

He wants you for the pressgang J J OMolloy said
THE GREAT GALLAHER

You can do it Myles Crawford repeated clenching his hand in emphasis Wait a minute Well paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun doing billiardmarking in the Clarence Gallaher that was a pressman for you That was a pen You know how he made his mark Ill tell you That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known That was in eightyone sixth of May time of the invincibles murder in the Phoenix park before you were born I suppose Ill show you

He pushed past them to the files

Look at here he said turning The New York World cabled for a special Remember that time

Professor MacHugh nodded

New York World the editor said excitedly pushing back his straw hat Where it took place Tim Kelly or Kavanagh I mean Joe Brady and the rest of them Where SkintheGoat drove the car Whole route see

SkintheGoat Mr OMadden Burke said Fitzharris He has that cabmans shelter they say down there at Butt bridge Holohan told me You know Holohan

Hop and carry one is it Myles Crawford said

And poor Gumley is down there too so he told me minding stones for the corporation A night watchman

Stephen turned in surprise

Gumley he said You dont say so A friend of my fathers is it

Never mind Gumley Myles Crawford cried angrily Let Gumley mind the stones see they dont run away Look at here What did Ignatius Gallaher do Ill tell you Inspiration of genius Cabled right away Have you Weekly Freeman of 17 March Right Have you got that

He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point

Take page four advertisement for Bransomes coffee let us say Have you got that Right

The telephone whirred
A DISTANT VOICE

Ill answer it the professor said going

B is parkgate Good

His finger leaped and struck point after point vibrating

T is viceregal lodge C is where murder took place K is Knockmaroon gate

The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cocks wattles An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat

Hello Evening Telegraph here Hello Whos there Yes Yes Yes

F to P is the route SkintheGoat drove the car for an alibi Inchicore Roundtown Windy Arbour Palmerston Park Ranelagh FABP Got that X is Davys publichouse in upper Leeson street

The professor came to the inner door

Bloom is at the telephone he said

Tell him go to hell the editor said promptly X is Davys publichouse see
CLEVER VERY

Clever Lenehan said Very

Gave it to them on a hot plate Myles Crawford said the whole bloody history

Nightmare from which you will never awake

I saw it the editor said proudly I was present Dick Adams the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in and myself

Lenehan bowed to a shape of air announcing

Madam Im Adam And Able was I ere I saw Elba

History Myles Crawford cried The Old Woman of Princes street was there first There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that Out of an advertisement Gregor Grey made the design for it That gave him the leg up Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the Star Now hes got in with Blumenfeld Thats press Thats talent Pyatt He was all their daddies

The father of scare journalism Lenehan confirmed and the brotherinlaw of Chris Callinan

Hello Are you there Yes hes here still Come across yourself

Where do you find a pressman like that now eh the editor cried

He flung the pages down

Clamn dever Lenehan said to Mr OMadden Burke

Very smart Mr OMadden Burke said

Professor MacHugh came from the inner office

Talking about the invincibles he said did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder

O yes J J OMolloy said eagerly Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought shed buy a view of Dublin And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or SkintheGoat Right outside the viceregal lodge imagine

Theyre only in the hook and eye department Myles Crawford said Psha Press and the bar Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows like Whiteside like Isaac Butt like silvertongued OHagan Eh Ah bloody nonsense Psha Only in the halfpenny place

His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain

Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss How do you know Why did you write it then
RHYMES AND REASONS

Mouth south Is the mouth south someway Or the south a mouth Must be some South pout out shout drouth Rhymes two men dressed the same looking the same two by two

 la tua pace
 che parlar ti piace
Mentre che il vento come fa si tace

He saw them three by three approaching girls in green in rose in russet entwining per laer perso in mauve in purple quella pacifica oriafiamma gold of oriflamme di rimirar f pi ardenti But I old men penitent leadenfooted underdarkneath the night mouth south tomb womb

Speak up for yourself Mr OMadden Burke said
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY

J J OMolloy smiling palely took up the gage

My dear Myles he said flinging his cigarette aside you put a false construction on my words I hold no brief as at present advised for the third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away with you Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss Harmsworth of the farthing press and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention Paddy Kellys Budget Pues Occurrences and our watchful friend The Skibbereen Eagle Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE

Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper the editor cried in his face Irish volunteers Where are you now Established 1763 Dr Lucas Who have you now like John Philpot Curran Psha

Well J J OMolloy said Bushe KC for example

Bushe the editor said Well yes Bushe yes He has a strain of it in his blood Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe

He would have been on the bench long ago the professor said only for  But no matter

J J OMolloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly

One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe It was in that case of fratricide the Childs murder case Bushe defended him

And in the porches of mine ear did pour

By the way how did he find that out He died in his sleep Or the other story beast with two backs

What was that the professor asked
ITALIA MAGISTRA ARTIUM

He spoke on the law of evidence J J OMolloy said of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code the lex talionis And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican

Ha

A few wellchosen words Lenehan prefaced Silence

Pause J J OMolloy took out his cigarettecase

False lull Something quite ordinary

Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar

I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act trivial in itself that striking of that match that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives
A POLISHED PERIOD

J J OMolloy resumed moulding his words

He said of it that stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live

His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall

Fine Myles Crawford said at once

The divine afflatus Mr OMadden Burke said

You like it J J OMolloy asked Stephen

Stephen his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture blushed He took a cigarette from the case J J OMolloy offered his case to Myles Crawford Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy saying

A MAN OF HIGH MORALE

Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you J J OMolloy said to Stephen What do you think really of that hermetic crowd the opal hush poets A E the mastermystic That Blavatsky woman started it She was a nice old bag of tricks A E has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A Es leg He is a man of the very highest morale Magennis

Speaking about me What did he say What did he say What did he say about me Dont ask

No thanks professor MacHugh said waving the cigarettecase aside Wait a moment Let me say one thing The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society Mr Justice Fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the Irish tongue

He turned towards Myles Crawford and said

You know Gerald Fitzgibbon Then you can imagine the style of his discourse

He is sitting with Tim Healy J J OMolloy said rumour has it on the Trinity college estates commission

He is sitting with a sweet thing Myles Crawford said in a childs frock Go on Well

It was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud mans contumely upon the new movement It was then a new movement We were weak therefore worthless

He closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus
IMPROMPTU

In ferial tone he addressed J J OMolloy

Taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man

His gaze turned at once but slowly from J J OMolloys towards Stephens face and then bent at once to the ground seeking His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair Still seeking he said

When Fitzgibbons speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply Briefly as well as I can bring them to mind his words were these

He raised his head firmly His eyes bethought themselves once more Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet

He began

Mr Chairman ladies and gentlemen Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses

His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech And let our crooked smokes Noble words coming Look out Could you try your hand at it yourself

And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me
FROM THE FATHERS

It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted Ah curse you Thats saint Augustine

Why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people You have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys trireme and quadrireme laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe You have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature a priesthood an agelong history and a polity

Nile

Child man effigy

By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel cradle of bulrushes a man supple in combat stonehorned stonebearded heart of stone

You pray to a local and obscure idol our temples majestic and mysterious are the abodes of Isis and Osiris of Horus and Ammon Ra Yours serfdom awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas Israel is weak and few are her children Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms Vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name

A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech He lifted his voice above it boldly

But ladies and gentlemen had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinais mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw

He ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence
OMINOUSFOR HIM

J J OMolloy said not without regret

And yet he died without having entered the land of promise

Asuddenatthemomentthoughfromlingeringillnessoftenpreviouslyexpectorateddemise Lenehan added And with a great future behind him

The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase

That is oratory the professor said uncontradicted

Gone with the wind Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings Miles of ears of porches The tribunes words howled and scattered to the four winds A people sheltered within his voice Dead noise Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was Love and laud him me no more

I have money

Gentlemen Stephen said As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn

You take my breath away It is not perchance a French compliment Mr OMadden Burke asked Tis the hour methinks when the winejug metaphorically speaking is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry

That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved All that are in favour say ay Lenehan announced The contrary no I declare it carried To which particular boosing shed My casting vote is Mooneys

He led the way admonishing

We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters will we not Yes we will not By no manner of means

Mr OMadden Burke following close said with an allys lunge of his umbrella

Lay on Macduff

Chip of the old block the editor cried clapping Stephen on the shoulder Let us go Where are those blasted keys

He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets

Foot and mouth I know Thatll be all right Thatll go in Where are they Thats all right

He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office
LET US HOPE

J J OMolloy about to follow him in said quietly to Stephen

I hope you will live to see it published Myles one moment

He went into the inner office closing the door behind him

Come along Stephen the professor said That is fine isnt it It has the prophetic vision Fuit Ilium The sack of windy Troy Kingdoms of this world The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today

The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street yelling

Racing special

Dublin I have much much to learn

They turned to the left along Abbey street

I have a vision too Stephen said

Yes the professor said skipping to get into step Crawford will follow

Another newsboy shot past them yelling as he ran

Racing special
DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN

Dubliners

Two Dublin vestals Stephen said elderly and pious have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumballys lane

Where is that the professor asked

Off Blackpitts Stephen said

Damp night reeking of hungry dough Against the wall Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl Frantic hearts Akasic records Quicker darlint

On now Dare it Let there be life

They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelsons pillar They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain

Wise virgins professor MacHugh said
LIFE ON THE RAW

They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins proprietress They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelsons pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase grunting encouraging each other afraid of the dark panting one asking the other have you the brawn praising God and the Blessed Virgin threatening to come down peeping at the airslits Glory be to God They had no idea it was that high

Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday

Antithesis the professor said nodding twice Vestal virgins I can see them Whats keeping our friend

He turned

A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps scattering in all directions yelling their white papers fluttering Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps his hat aureoling his scarlet face talking with J J OMolloy

Come along the professor cried waving his arm

He set off again to walk by Stephens side
RETURN OF BLOOM

Yes he said I see them

Mr Bloom breathless caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the Irish Catholic and Dublin Penny Journal called

Mr Crawford A moment

Telegraph Racing special

What is it Myles Crawford said falling back a pace

A newsboy cried in Mr Blooms face

Terrible tragedy in Rathmines A child bit by a bellows

KMRIA

He can kiss my royal Irish arse Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder Any time he likes tell him

While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily
RAISING THE WIND

Nulla bona Jack he said raising his hand to his chin Im up to here Ive been through the hoop myself I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week Sorry Jack You must take the will for the deed With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow

J J OMolloy pulled a long face and walked on silently They caught up on the others and walked abreast

When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings

Something for you the professor explained to Myles Crawford Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelsons pillar
SOME COLUMNTHATS WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID

Thats new Myles Crawford said Thats copy Out for the waxies Dargle Two old trickies what

But they are afraid the pillar will fall Stephen went on They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are Rathmines blue dome Adam and Eves saint Laurence OTooles But it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES

Easy all Myles Crawford said No poetic licence Were in the archdiocese here

And settle down on their striped petticoats peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer

Onehandled adulterer the professor cried I like that I see the idea I see what you mean
DAMES DONATE DUBLINS CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS BELIEF

It gives them a crick in their necks Stephen said and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it one after another wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings

He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close Lenehan and Mr OMadden Burke hearing turned beckoned and led on across towards Mooneys

Finished Myles Crawford said So long as they do no worse
SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP

You remind me of Antisthenes the professor said a disciple of Gorgias the sophist It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope

Poor Penelope Penelope Rich

They made ready to cross OConnell street

VIRGILIAN SAYS PEDAGOGUE SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES

Call it wait the professor said opening his long lips wide to reflect Call it let me see Call it deus nobis hc otia fecit

No Stephen said I call it A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of The Plums

I see the professor said

He laughed richly

I see he said again with new pleasure Moses and the promised land We gave him that idea he added to J J OMolloy
HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY

J J OMolloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace

I see the professor said

He halted on sir John Grays pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile
DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS ANNE WIMBLES FLO WANGLESYET CAN YOU BLAME THEM

Looking down he saw flapping strongly wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls gulls Rough weather outside If I threw myself down Reuben Js son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage One and eightpence too much Hhhhm Its the droll way he comes out with the things Knows how to tell a story too

They wheeled lower Looking for grub Wait

His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand Australians they must be this time of year Shiny peels polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief

Wait Those poor birds

He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey See that The gulls swooped silently two then all from their heights pouncing on prey Gone Every morsel

Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands They never expected that Manna Live on fish fishy flesh they have all seabirds gulls seagoose Swans from Anna Liffey swim down here sometimes to preen themselves No accounting for tastes Wonder what kind is swanmeat Robinson Crusoe had to live on them

Indeed it is Mr Bloom said

She took back the card sighing

And now hes going round to Mr Mentons office Hes going to take an action for ten thousand pounds he says

She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch

Same blue serge dress she had two years ago the nap bleaching Seen its best days Wispish hair over her ears And that dowdy toque three old grapes to take the harm out of it Shabby genteel She used to be a tasty dresser Lines round her mouth Only a year or so older than Molly

His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news His tongue clacked in compassion Dth Dth

Im sorry to hear that he said Poor thing Three days Thats terrible for her

Mrs Breen nodded

She was taken bad on the Tuesday

Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently warning her

Mind Let this man pass

A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head From his arm a folded dustcoat a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride

Watch him Mr Bloom said He always walks outside the lampposts Watch

Who is he if its a fair question Mrs Breen asked Is he dotty

His name is Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell Mr Bloom said smiling Watch

He has enough of them she said Denis will be like that one of these days

She broke off suddenly

There he is she said I must go after him Goodbye Remember me to Molly wont you

I will Mr Bloom said

He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrisons hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs Blown in from the bay Like old times He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly

Meshuggah Off his chump

Mr Bloom walked on again easily seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat Going the two days Watch him Out he goes again One way of getting on in the world And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds Hard time she must have with him

U p up Ill take my oath thats Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything Round to Mentons office His oyster eyes staring at the postcard Be a feast for the gods

Funny sight two of them together their bellies out Molly and Mrs Moisel Mothers meeting Phthisis retires for the time being then returns How flat they look all of a sudden after Peaceful eyes Weight off their mind Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul All my babies she said The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them O thats nyumnyum Got her hand crushed by old Tom Walls son His first bow to the public Head like a prize pumpkin Snuffy Dr Murren People knocking them up at all hours For God sake doctor Wife in her throes Then keep them waiting months for their fee To attendance on your wife No gratitude in people Humane doctors most of them

Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of pigeons flew Their little frolic after meals Who will we do it on I pick the fellow in black Here goes Heres good luck Must be thrilling from the air Apjohn myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near Goose green playing the monkeys Mackerel they called me

A squad of constables debouched from College street marching in Indian file Goosestep Foodheated faces sweating helmets patting their truncheons After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts Policemans lot is oft a happy one They split up in groups and scattered saluting towards their beats Let out to graze Best moment to attack one in pudding time A punch in his dinner A squad of others marching irregularly rounded Trinity railings making for the station Bound for their troughs Prepare to receive cavalry Prepare to receive soup

He crossed under Tommy Moores roguish finger They did right to put him up over a urinal meeting of the waters Ought to be places for women Running into cakeshops Settle my hat straight There is not in this wide world a vallee Great song of Julia Morkans Kept her voice up to the very last Pupil of Michael Balfes wasnt she

He gazed after the last broad tunic Nasty customers to tackle Jack Power could a tale unfold father a G man If a fellow gave them trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell Cant blame them after all with the job they have especially the young hornies That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money My word he did His horses hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street Lucky I had the presence of mind to dive into Mannings or I was souped He did come a wallop by George Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones I oughtnt to have got myself swept along with those medicals And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards Looking for trouble Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now hes in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy Wheels within wheels Police whistle in my ears still All skedaddled Why he fixed on me Give me in charge Right here it began

Noone is anything

This is the very worst hour of the day Vitality Dull gloomy hate this hour Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed

Provosts house The reverend Dr Salmon tinned salmon Well tinned in there Like a mortuary chapel Wouldnt live in it if they paid me Hope they have liver and bacon today Nature abhors a vacuum

The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware opposite in Walter Sextons window by which John Howard Parnell passed unseeing

There he is the brother Image of him Haunting face Now thats a coincidence Course hundreds of times you think of a person and dont meet him Like a man walking in his sleep Noone knows him Must be a corporation meeting today They say he never put on the city marshals uniform since he got the job Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his high horse cocked hat puffed powdered and shaved Look at the woebegone walk of him Eaten a bad egg Poached eyes on ghost I have a pain Great mans brother his brothers brother Hed look nice on the city charger Drop into the DBC probably for his coffee play chess there His brother used men as pawns Let them all go to pot Afraid to pass a remark on him Freeze them up with that eye of his Thats the fascination the name All a bit touched Mad Fanny and his other sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness Bolt upright like surgeon MArdle Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life The patriots banquet Eating orangepeels in the park Simon Dedalus said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm

Of the twoheaded octopus one of whose heads is the head upon which the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a Scotch accent The tentacles

They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone Beard and bicycle Young woman

And there he is too Now thats really a coincidence second time Coming events cast their shadows before With the approval of the eminent poet Mr Geo Russell That might be Lizzie Twigg with him A E what does that mean Initials perhaps Albert Edward Arthur Edmund Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire What was he saying The ends of the world with a Scotch accent Tentacles octopus Something occult symbolism Holding forth Shes taking it all in Not saying a word To aid gentleman in literary work

His eyes followed the high figure in homespun beard and bicycle a listening woman at his side Coming from the vegetarian Only weggebobbles and fruit Dont eat a beefsteak If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity They say its healthier Windandwatery though Tried it Keep you on the run all day Bad as a bloater Dreams all night Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak Nutarians Fruitarians To give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak Absurd Salty too They cook in soda Keep you sitting by the tap all night

Her stockings are loose over her ankles I detest that so tasteless Those literary etherial people they are all Dreamy cloudy symbolistic Esthetes they are I wouldnt be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldnt squeeze a line of poetry out of him Dont know what poetry is even Must be in a certain mood

He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and Son pricing the fieldglasses Or will I drop into old Harriss and have a chat with young Sinclair Wellmannered fellow Probably at his lunch Must get those old glasses of mine set right Goerz lenses six guineas Germans making their way everywhere Sell on easy terms to capture trade Undercutting Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office Astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms What do they be thinking about Women too Incredible Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmers daughters bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction Unclaimed money too Theres a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by

His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides Cant see it If you imagine its there you can almost see it Cant see it

He faced about and standing between the awnings held out his right hand at arms length towards the sun Wanted to try that often Yes completely The tip of his little finger blotted out the suns disk Must be the focus where the rays cross If I had black glasses Interesting There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west Looking up from the back garden Terrific explosions they are There will be a total eclipse this year autumn some time

Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time Its the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink Must go out there some first Saturday of the month If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn up something about his family That would do to man always feels complimented Flattery where least expected Nobleman proud to be descended from some kings mistress His foremother Lay it on with a trowel Cap in hand goes through the land Not go in and blurt out what you know youre not to whats parallax Show this gentleman the door

Ah

His hand fell to his side again

Never know anything about it Waste of time Gasballs spinning about crossing each other passing Same old dingdong always Gas then solid then world then cold then dead shell drifting around frozen rock like that pineapple rock The moon Must be a new moon out she said I believe there is

He went on by la maison Claire

Wait The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon Walking down by the Tolka Not bad for a Fairview moon She was humming The young May moon shes beaming love He other side of her Elbow arm He Glowworms laamp is gleaming love Touch Fingers Asking Answer Yes

Stop Stop If it was it was Must

Mr Bloom quickbreathing slowlier walking passed Adam court

With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here middle of the day of Bob Dorans bottle shoulders On his annual bend MCoy said They drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la femme Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year sober as a judge

Yes Thought so Sloping into the Empire Gone Plain soda would do him good Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queens Broth of a boy Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon face in a poky bonnet Three Purty Maids from School How time flies eh Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts Drinkers drinking laughed spluttering their drink against their breath More power Pat Coarse red fun for drunkards guffaw and smoke Take off that white hat His parboiled eyes Where is he now Beggar somewhere The harp that once did starve us all

I was happier then Or was that I Or am I now I Twentyeight I was She twentythree When we left Lombard street west something changed Could never like it again after Rudy Cant bring back time Like holding water in your hand Would you go back to then Just beginning then Would you Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy Wants to sew on buttons for me I must answer Write it in the library

Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses Muslin prints silkdames and dowagers jingle of harnesses hoofthuds lowringing in the baking causeway Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings Hope the rain mucks them up on her Countrybred chawbacon All the beef to the heels were in Always gives a woman clumsy feet Molly looks out of plumb

He passed dallying the windows of Brown Thomas silk mercers Cascades of ribbons Flimsy China silks A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin lustrous blood The huguenots brought that here La causa  santa Tara tara Great chorus that Taree tara Must be washed in rainwater Meyerbeer Tara bom bom bom

Pincushions Im a long time threatening to buy one Sticking them all over the place Needles in window curtains

He bared slightly his left forearm Scrape nearly gone Not today anyhow Must go back for that lotion For her birthday perhaps Junejulyaugseptember eighth Nearly three months off Then she mightnt like it Women wont pick up pins Say it cuts lo

Gleaming silks petticoats on slim brass rails rays of flat silk stockings

Useless to go back Had to be Tell me all

High voices Sunwarm silk Jingling harnesses All for a woman home and houses silkwebs silver rich fruits spicy from Jaffa Agendath Netaim Wealth of the world

A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain His brain yielded Perfume of embraces all him assailed With hungered flesh obscurely he mutely craved to adore

Duke street Here we are Must eat The Burton Feel better then

He turned Combridges corner still pursued Jingling hoofthuds Perfumed bodies warm full All kissed yielded in deep summer fields tangled pressed grass in trickling hallways of tenements along sofas creaking beds

Jack love

Darling

Kiss me Reggy

My boy

Love

His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant Stink gripped his trembling breath pungent meatjuice slush of greens See the animals feed

Men men men

Perched on high stools by the bar hats shoved back at the tables calling for more bread no charge swilling wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food their eyes bulging wiping wetted moustaches A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin New set of microbes A man with an infants saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet A man spitting back on his plate halfmasticated gristle gums no teeth to chewchewchew it Chump chop from the grill Bolting to get it over Sad boosers eyes Bitten off more than he can chew Am I like that See ourselves as others see us Hungry man is an angry man Working tooth and jaw Dont O A bone That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne Wonder what he was eating Something galoptious Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity Couldnt swallow it all however

Roast beef and cabbage

One stew

Smells of men Spaton sawdust sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke reek of plug spilt beer mens beery piss the stale of ferment

His gorge rose

Couldnt eat a morsel here Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him old chap picking his tootles Slight spasm full chewing the cud Before and after Grace after meals Look on this picture then on that Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread Lick it off the plate man Get out of this

He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters tightening the wings of his nose

Two stouts here

One corned and cabbage

That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it Good stroke Give me the fidgets to look Safer to eat from his three hands Tear it limb from limb Second nature to him Born with a silver knife in his mouth Thats witty I think Or no Silver means born rich Born with a knife But then the allusion is lost

An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates Rock the head bailiff standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard Well up it splashed yellow near his boot A diner knife and fork upright elbows on table ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift across his stained square of newspaper Other chap telling him something with his mouth full Sympathetic listener Table talk I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday Ha Did you faith

Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips His eyes said

Not here Dont see him

Out I hate dirty eaters

He backed towards the door Get a light snack in Davy Byrnes Stopgap Keep me going Had a good breakfast

Roast and mashed here

Pint of stout

Every fellow for his own tooth and nail Gulp Grub Gulp Gobstuff

He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street Eat or be eaten Kill Kill

Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline Blood always needed Insidious Lick it up smokinghot thick sugary Famished ghosts

Ah Im hungry

He entered Davy Byrnes Moral pub He doesnt chat Stands a drink now and then But in leapyear once in four Cashed a cheque for me once

What will I take now He drew his watch Let me see now Shandygaff

Hello Bloom Nosey Flynn said from his nook

Hello Flynn

Sardines on the shelves Almost taste them by looking Sandwich Ham and his descendants musterred and bred there Potted meats What is home without Plumtrees potted meat Incomplete What a stupid ad Under the obituary notices they stuck it All up a plumtree Dignams potted meat Cannibals would with lemon and rice White missionary too salty Like pickled pork Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour Ought to be tough from exercise His wives in a row to watch the effect There was a right royal old nigger Who ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger With it an abode of bliss Lord knows what concoction Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up Puzzle find the meat Kosher No meat and milk together Hygiene that was what they call now Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside Peace and war depend on some fellows digestion Religions Christmas turkeys and geese Slaughter of innocents Eat drink and be merry Then casual wards full after Heads bandaged Cheese digests all but itself Mity cheese

Nosey Flynn sipped his grog

Doing any singing those times

Look at his mouth Could whistle in his own ear Flap ears to match Music Knows as much about it as my coachman Still better tell him Does no harm Free ad

Shes engaged for a big tour end of this month You may have heard perhaps

No O thats the style Whos getting it up

The curate served

How much is that

Seven d sir Thank you sir

Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips Mr MacTrigger Easier than the dreamy creamy stuff His five hundred wives Had the time of their lives

Mustard sir

Thank you

He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs Their lives I have it It grew bigger and bigger and bigger

Getting it up he said Well its like a company idea you see Part shares and part profits

Ay now I remember Nosey Flynn said putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin Who is this was telling me Isnt Blazes Boylan mixed up in it

A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Blooms heart He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock Two Pub clock five minutes fast Time going on Hands moving Two Not yet

His midriff yearned then upward sank within him yearned more longly longingly

Wine

He smellsipped the cordial juice and bidding his throat strongly to speed it set his wineglass delicately down

Yes he said Hes the organiser in point of fact

No fear no brains

Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched Flea having a good square meal

He had a good slice of luck Jack Mooney was telling me over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks By God he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me

Hope that dewdrop doesnt come down into his glass No snuffled it up

For near a month man before it came off Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders Keep him off the boose see O by God Blazes is a hairy chap

Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin Herrings blush Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete Too much fat on the parsnips

And heres himself and pepper on him Nosey Flynn said Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup

Im off that Mr Flynn Davy Byrne answered I never put anything on a horse

Youre right there Nosey Flynn said

Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich fresh clean bread with relish of disgust pungent mustard the feety savour of green cheese Sips of his wine soothed his palate Not logwood that Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off

Nice quiet bar Nice piece of wood in that counter Nicely planed Like the way it curves there

I wouldnt do anything at all in that line Davy Byrne said It ruined many a man the same horses

Vintners sweepstake Licensed for the sale of beer wine and spirits for consumption on the premises Heads I win tails you lose

True for you Nosey Flynn said Unless youre in the know Theres no straight sport going now Lenehan gets some good ones Hes giving Sceptre today Zinfandels the favourite Lord Howard de Waldens won at Epsom Morny Cannon is riding him I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before

That so Davy Byrne said

He went towards the window and taking up the pettycash book scanned its pages

I could faith Nosey Flynn said snuffling That was a rare bit of horseflesh Saint Frusquin was her sire She won in a thunderstorm Rothschilds filly with wadding in her ears Blue jacket and yellow cap Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John OGaunt He put me off it Ay

He drank resignedly from his tumbler running his fingers down the flutes

Ay he said sighing

Mr Bloom champing standing looked upon his sigh Nosey numbskull Will I tell him that horse Lenehan He knows already Better let him forget Go and lose more Fool and his money Dewdrop coming down again Cold nose hed have kissing a woman Still they might like Prickly beards they like Dogs cold noses Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomachs Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel Molly fondling him in her lap O the big doggybowwowsywowsy

Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish cheese Nice wine it is Taste it better because Im not thirsty Bath of course does that Just a bite or two Then about six oclock I can Six Six Time will be gone then She

Mild fire of wine kindled his veins I wanted that badly Felt so off colour His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins sardines gaudy lobsters claws All the odd things people pick up for food Out of shells periwinkles with a pin off trees snails out of the ground the French eat out of the sea with bait on a hook Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years If you didnt know risky putting anything into your mouth Poisonous berries Johnny Magories Roundness you think good Gaudy colour warns you off One fellow told another and so on Try it on the dog first Led on by the smell or the look Tempting fruit Ice cones Cream Instinct Orangegroves for instance Need artificial irrigation Bleibtreustrasse Yes but what about oysters Unsightly like a clot of phlegm Filthy shells Devil to open them too Who found them out Garbage sewage they feed on Fizz and Red bank oysters Effect on the sexual Aphrodis He was in the Red Bank this morning Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters But there are people like things high Tainted game Jugged hare First catch your hare Chinese eating eggs fifty years old blue and green again Dinner of thirty courses Each dish harmless might mix inside Idea for a poison mystery That archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head Cheapest lunch in town Of course aristocrats then the others copy to be in the fashion Milly too rock oil and flour Raw pastry I like myself Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price Cheap noone would buy Caviare Do the grand Hock in green glasses Swell blowout Lady this Powdered bosom pearls The lite Crme de la crme They want special dishes to pretend theyre Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh Know me come eat with me Royal sturgeon high sheriff Coffey the butcher right to venisons of the forest from his ex Send him back the half of a cow Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls kitchen area Whitehatted chef like a rabbi Combustible duck Curly cabbage  la duchesse de Parme Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what youve eaten Too many drugs spoil the broth I know it myself Dosing it with Edwards desiccated soup Geese stuffed silly for them Lobsters boiled alive Do ptake some ptarmigan Wouldnt mind being a waiter in a swell hotel Tips evening dress halfnaked ladies May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole miss Dubedat Yes do bedad And she did bedad Huguenot name I expect that A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney I remember Du de la is French Still its the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes gills cant write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues worth fifty thousand pounds

Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed stuck

His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab Beauty it curves curves are beauty Shapely goddesses Venus Juno curves the world admires Can see them library museum standing in the round hall naked goddesses Aids to digestion They dont care what man looks All to see Never speaking I mean to say to fellows like Flynn Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first Mortal Put you in your proper place Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes all ambrosial Not like a tanner lunch we have boiled mutton carrots and turnips bottle of Allsop Nectar imagine it drinking electricity gods food Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian Immortal lovely And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind food chyle blood dung earth food have to feed it like stoking an engine They have no Never looked Ill look today Keeper wont see Bend down let something fall see if she

Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked to men too they gave themselves manly conscious lay with men lovers a youth enjoyed her to the yard

When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book

What is this he is Isnt he in the insurance line

Hes out of that long ago Nosey Flynn said He does canvassing for the Freeman

I know him well to see Davy Byrne said Is he in trouble

Trouble Nosey Flynn said Not that I heard of Why

I noticed he was in mourning

Was he Nosey Flynn said So he was faith I asked him how was all at home Youre right by God So he was

I never broach the subject Davy Byrne said humanely if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way It only brings it up fresh in their minds

Its not the wife anyhow Nosey Flynn said I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolans wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half Shes well nourished I tell you Plovers on toast

And is he doing for the Freeman Davy Byrne said

Nosey Flynn pursed his lips

He doesnt buy cream on the ads he picks up You can make bacon of that

How so Davy Byrne asked coming from his book

Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers He winked

Hes in the craft he said

Do you tell me so Davy Byrne said

Very much so Nosey Flynn said Ancient free and accepted order Hes an excellent brother Light life and love by God They give him a leg up I was told that by awell I wont say who

Is that a fact

O its a fine order Nosey Flynn said They stick to you when youre down I know a fellow was trying to get into it But theyre as close as damn it By God they did right to keep the women out of it

Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one

Iiiiiichaaaaaaach

There was one woman Nosey Flynn said hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile

Davy Byrne sated after his yawn said with tearwashed eyes

And is that a fact Decent quiet man he is I often saw him in here and I never once saw himyou know over the line

God Almighty couldnt make him drunk Nosey Flynn said firmly Slips off when the fun gets too hot Didnt you see him look at his watch Ah you werent there If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe Declare to God he does

There are some like that Davy Byrne said Hes a safe man Id say

Hes not too bad Nosey Flynn said snuffling it up Hes been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow Give the devil his due O Bloom has his good points But theres one thing hell never do

His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog

I know Davy Byrne said

Nothing in black and white Nosey Flynn said

Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in Tom Rochford followed frowning a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat

Day Mr Byrne

Day gentlemen

They paused at the counter

Whos standing Paddy Leonard asked

Im sitting anyhow Nosey Flynn answered

Well whatll it be Paddy Leonard asked

Ill take a stone ginger Bantam Lyons said

How much Paddy Leonard cried Since when for God sake Whats yours Tom

How is the main drainage Nosey Flynn asked sipping

For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped

Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water Mr Byrne he said

Certainly sir

Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates

Lord love a duck he said Look at what Im standing drinks to Cold water and gingerpop Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup A dead snip

Zinfandel is it Nosey Flynn asked

Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him

That cursed dyspepsia he said before drinking

Breadsoda is very good Davy Byrne said

Tom Rochford nodded and drank

Is it Zinfandel

Say nothing Bantam Lyons winked Im going to plunge five bob on my own

Tell us if youre worth your salt and be damned to you Paddy Leonard said Who gave it to you

Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting

So long Nosey Flynn said

The others turned

Thats the man now that gave it to me Bantam Lyons whispered

Prrwht Paddy Leonard said with scorn Mr Byrne sir well take two of your small Jamesons after that and a

Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street his tongue brushing his teeth smooth Something green it would have to be spinach say Then with those Rntgen rays searchlight you could

At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest Surfeit Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents First sweet then savoury Mr Bloom coasted warily Ruminants His second course Their upper jaw they move Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his Wasting time explaining it to Flynns mouth Lean people long mouths Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free Course then youd have all the cranks pestering

He hummed prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars

Today Today Not think

Tour the south then What about English wateringplaces Brighton Margate Piers by moonlight Her voice floating out Those lovely seaside girls Against John Longs a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought gnawing a crusted knuckle Handy man wants job Small wages Will eat anything

Mr Bloom turned at Grays confectioners window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellans bookstore Why I left the church of Rome Birds Nest Women run him They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews Same bait Why we left the church of Rome

A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane No tram in sight Wants to cross

Do you want to cross Mr Bloom asked

The blind stripling did not answer His wallface frowned weakly He moved his head uncertainly

Youre in Dawson street Mr Bloom said Molesworth street is opposite Do you want to cross Theres nothing in the way

The cane moved out trembling to the left Mr Blooms eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks van drawn up before Dragos Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was Horse drooping Driver in John Longs Slaking his drouth

Theres a van there Mr Bloom said but its not moving Ill see you across Do you want to go to Molesworth street

Yes the stripling answered South Frederick street

Come Mr Bloom said

He touched the thin elbow gently then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward

Say something to him Better not do the condescending They mistrust what you tell them Pass a common remark

The rain kept off

No answer

Thanks sir

Right now First turn to the left

The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way drawing his cane back feeling again

Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed Poor young fellow How on earth did he know that van was there Must have felt it See things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume Weight or size of it something blacker than the dark Wonder would he feel it if something was removed Feel a gap Queer idea of Dublin he must have tapping his way round by the stones Could he walk in a beeline if he hadnt that cane Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest

Postoffice Must answer Fag today Send her a postal order two shillings half a crown Accept my little present Stationers just here too Wait Think over it

With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears Again Fibres of fine fine straw Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek Downy hair there too Not smooth enough The belly is the smoothest Noone about There he goes into Frederick street Perhaps to Levenstons dancing academy piano Might be settling my braces

Walking by Dorans publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and pulling aside his shirt gently felt a slack fold of his belly But I know its whitey yellow Want to try in the dark to see

He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to

Urbane to comfort them the quaker librarian purred

And we have have we not those priceless pages of Wilhelm Meister A great poet on a great brother poet A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles torn by conflicting doubts as one sees in real life

He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor

A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck

Directly said he creaking to go albeit lingering The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts One always feels that Goethes judgments are so true True in the larger analysis

Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off Bald most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendants words heard them and was gone

Mulligan has my telegram

Folly Persist

Our young Irish bards John Eglinton censured have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeares Hamlet though I admire him as old Ben did on this side idolatry

All these questions are purely academic Russell oracled out of his shadow I mean whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex Clergymens discussions of the historicity of Jesus Art has to reveal to us ideas formless spiritual essences The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas The deepest poetry of Shelley the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom Platos world of ideas All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys

A E has been telling some yankee interviewer Wall tarnation strike me

The schoolmen were schoolboys first Stephen said superpolitely Aristotle was once Platos schoolboy

And has remained so one should hope John Eglinton sedately said One can see him a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm

He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face

Formless spiritual Father Word and Holy Breath Allfather the heavenly man Hiesos Kristos magician of the beautiful the Logos who suffers in us at every moment This verily is that I am the fire upon the altar I am the sacrificial butter

Dunlop Judge the noblest Roman of them all AE Arval the Name Ineffable in heaven hight KH their master whose identity is no secret to adepts Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if they can help The Christ with the bridesister moisture of light born of an ensouled virgin repentant sophia departed to the plane of buddhi The life esoteric is not for ordinary person OP must work off bad karma first Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister HPBs elemental

O fie Out ont Pfuiteufel You naughtnt to look missus so you naughtnt when a ladys ashowing of her elemental

Mr Best entered tall young mild light He bore in his hand with grace a notebook new large clean bright

That model schoolboy Stephen said would find Hamlets musings about the afterlife of his princely soul the improbable insignificant and undramatic monologue as shallow as Platos

John Eglinton frowning said waxing wroth

Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato

Which of the two Stephen asked would have banished me from his commonwealth

Unsheathe your dagger definitions Horseness is the whatness of allhorse Streams of tendency and eons they worship God noise in the street very peripatetic Space what you damn well have to see Through spaces smaller than red globules of mans blood they creepycrawl after Blakes buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow Hold to the now the here through which all future plunges to the past

Mr Best came forward amiable towards his colleague

Haines is gone he said

Is he

I was showing him Jubainvilles book Hes quite enthusiastic dont you know about Hydes Lovesongs of Connacht I couldnt bring him in to hear the discussion Hes gone to Gills to buy it

Bound thee forth my booklet quick
To greet the callous public
Writ I ween twas not my wish
In lean unlovely English

The peatsmoke is going to his head John Eglinton opined

We feel in England Penitent thief Gone I smoked his baccy Green twinkling stone An emerald set in the ring of the sea

People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be the auric egg of Russell warned occultly The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasants heart on the hillside For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel the musichall song France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarm but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart the life of Homers Phacians

From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen

Mallarm dont you know he said has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris The one about Hamlet He says il se promne lisant au livre de luimme dont you know reading the book of himself He describes Hamlet given in a French town dont you know a provincial town They advertised it

His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air

Hamlet
ou
Le Distrait
Pice de Shakespeare

He repeated to John Eglintons newgathered frown

Pice de Shakespeare dont you know Its so French The French point of view Hamlet ou

The absentminded beggar Stephen ended

John Eglinton laughed

Yes I suppose it would be he said Excellent people no doubt but distressingly shortsighted in some matters

Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder

A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him Stephen said Not for nothing was he a butchers son wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms Nine lives are taken off for his fathers one Our Father who art in purgatory Khaki Hamlets dont hesitate to shoot The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne

Cranly I his mute orderly following battles from afar

Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none
But we had spared

Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp The devil and the deep sea

He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory John Eglinton said for Mr Bests behoof Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep

List List O List

My flesh hears him creeping hears

If thou didst ever

What is a ghost Stephen said with tingling energy One who has faded into impalpability through death through absence through change of manners Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin Who is the ghost from limbo patrum returning to the world that has forgotten him Who is King Hamlet

John Eglinton shifted his spare body leaning back to judge

Lifted

It is this hour of a day in mid June Stephen said begging with a swift glance their hearing The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it Paris garden Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings

Local colour Work in all you know Make them accomplices

Shakespeare has left the huguenots house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes The swan of Avon has other thoughts

Composition of place Ignatius Loyola make haste to help me

The play begins A player comes on under the shadow made up in the castoff mail of a court buck a wellset man with a bass voice It is the ghost the king a king and no king and the player is Shakespeare who has studied Hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre He speaks the words to Burbage the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth calling him by a name

Hamlet I am thy fathers spirit

bidding him list To a son he speaks the son of his soul the prince young Hamlet and to the son of his body Hamnet Shakespeare who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever

Is it possible that that player Shakespeare a ghost by absence and in the vesture of buried Denmark a ghost by death speaking his own words to his own sons name had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlets twin is it possible I want to know or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises you are the dispossessed son I am the murdered father your mother is the guilty queen Ann Shakespeare born Hathaway

But this prying into the family life of a great man Russell began impatiently

Art thou there truepenny

Interesting only to the parish clerk I mean we have the plays I mean when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet lived As for living our servants can do that for us Villiers de lIsle has said Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day the poets drinking the poets debts We have King Lear and it is immortal

Mr Bests face appealed to agreed

AEIOU

Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries John Eglintons carping voice asked Her ghost at least has been laid for ever She died for literature at least before she was born

She died Stephen retorted sixtyseven years after she was born She saw him into and out of the world She took his first embraces She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed

Mothers deathbed Candle The sheeted mirror Who brought me into this world lies there bronzelidded under few cheap flowers Liliata rutilantium

I wept alone

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp

The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake he said and got out of it as quickly and as best he could

Bosh Stephen said rudely A man of genius makes no mistakes His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery

Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian softcreakfooted bald eared and assiduous

A shrew John Eglinton said shrewdly is not a useful portal of discovery one should imagine What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe

Dialectic Stephen answered and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world What he learnt from his other wife Myrto absit nomen Socratididions Epipsychidion no man not a woman will ever know But neither the midwifes lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock

But Ann Hathaway Mr Bests quiet voice said forgetfully Yes we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her

His look went from brooders beard to carpers skull to remind to chide them not unkindly then to the baldpink lollard costard guiltless though maligned

He had a good groatsworth of wit Stephen said and no truant memory He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling The girl I left behind me If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat sitting in his form the cry of hounds the studded bridle and her blue windows That memory Venus and Adonis lay in the bedchamber of every lightoflove in London Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured Hortensio calls her young and beautiful Do you think the writer of Antony and Cleopatra a passionate pilgrim had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal Good he left her and gained the world of men But his boywomen are the women of a boy Their life thought speech are lent them by males He chose badly He was chosen it seems to me If others have their will Ann hath a way By cock she was to blame She put the comether on him sweet and twentysix The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis stooping to conquer as prologue to the swelling act is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself

And my turn When

Come

Ryefield Mr Best said brightly gladly raising his new book gladly brightly

He murmured then with blond delight for all

Between the acres of the rye
These pretty countryfolk would lie

Paris the wellpleased pleaser

A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch

I am afraid I am due at the Homestead

Whither away Exploitable ground

Are you going John Eglintons active eyebrows asked Shall we see you at Moores tonight Piper is coming

Piper Mr Best piped Is Piper back

Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper

I dont know if I can Thursday We have our meeting If I can get away in time

In quintessential triviality
For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt

They say we are to have a literary surprise the quaker librarian said friendly and earnest Mr Russell rumour has it is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets verses We are all looking forward anxiously

Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces lighted shone

See this Remember

Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee My casque and sword Touch lightly with two index fingers Aristotles experiment One or two Necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise Argal one hat is one hat

Listen

Young Colum and Starkey George Roberts is doing the commercial part Longworth will give it a good puff in the Express O will he I liked Colums Drover Yes I think he has that queer thing genius Do you think he has genius really Yeats admired his line As in wild earth a Grecian vase Did he I hope youll be able to come tonight Malachi Mulligan is coming too Moore asked him to bring Haines Did you hear Miss Mitchells joke about Moore and Martyn That Moore is Martyns wild oats Awfully clever isnt it They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza Our national epic has yet to be written Dr Sigerson says Moore is the man for it A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin With a saffron kilt ONeill Russell O yes he must speak the grand old tongue And his Dulcinea James Stephens is doing some clever sketches We are becoming important it seems

Cordelia Cordoglio Lirs loneliest daughter

Nookshotten Now your best French polish

Thank you very much Mr Russell Stephen said rising If you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman

O yes If he considers it important it will go in We have so much correspondence

I understand Stephen said Thanks

God ild you The pigs paper Bullockbefriending

Synge has promised me an article for Dana too Are we going to be read I feel we are The Gaelic league wants something in Irish I hope you will come round tonight Bring Starkey

Stephen sat down

The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers Blushing his mask said

Mr Dedalus your views are most illuminating

He creaked to and fro tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine and covered by the noise of outgoing said low

Is it your view then that she was not faithful to the poet

Alarmed face asks me Why did he come Courtesy or an inward light

Where there is a reconciliation Stephen said there must have been first a sundering

Yes

Christfox in leather trews hiding a runaway in blighted treeforks from hue and cry Knowing no vixen walking lonely in the chase Women he won to him tender people a whore of Babylon ladies of justices bully tapsters wives Fox and geese And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely once as sweet as fresh as cinnamon now her leaves falling all bare frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven

Yes So you think

The door closed behind the outgoer

Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell rest of warm and brooding air

A vestals lamp

Here he ponders things that were not what Csar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer what might have been possibilities of the possible as possible things not known what name Achilles bore when he lived among women

Coffined thoughts around me in mummycases embalmed in spice of words Thoth god of libraries a birdgod moonycrowned And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks

They are still Once quick in the brains of men Still but an itch of death is in them to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale urge me to wreak their will

Certainly John Eglinton mused of all great men he is the most enigmatic We know nothing but that he lived and suffered Not even so much Others abide our question A shadow hangs over all the rest

But Hamlet is so personal isnt it Mr Best pleaded I mean a kind of private paper dont you know of his private life I mean I dont care a button dont you know who is killed or who is guilty

He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk smiling his defiance His private papers in the original Ta an bad ar an tir Taim in mo shagart Put beurla on it littlejohn

Quoth littlejohn Eglinton

I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you

Bear with me

Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows A basilisk E quando vede luomo lattosca Messer Brunetto I thank thee for the word

As we or mother Dana weave and unweave our bodies Stephen said from day to day their molecules shuttled to and fro so does the artist weave and unweave his image And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth In the intense instant of imagination when the mind Shelley says is a fading coal that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be So in the future the sister of the past I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be

Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile

Yes Mr Best said youngly I feel Hamlet quite young The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son

Has the wrong sow by the lug He is in my father I am in his son

That mole is the last to go Stephen said laughing

John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow

If that were the birthmark of genius he said genius would be a drug in the market The plays of Shakespeares later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit

The spirit of reconciliation the quaker librarian breathed

There can be no reconciliation Stephen said if there has not been a sundering

Said that

If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of King Lear Othello Hamlet Troilus and Cressida look to see when and how the shadow lifts What softens the heart of a man shipwrecked in storms dire Tried like another Ulysses Pericles prince of Tyre

Head redconecapped buffeted brineblinded

A child a girl placed in his arms Marina

The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity John Eglinton detected The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town

Good Bacon gone musty Shakespeare Bacons wild oats Cypherjugglers going the highroads Seekers on the great quest What town good masters Mummed in names A E eon Magee John Eglinton East of the sun west of the moon Tir na nog Booted the twain and staved

How many miles to Dublin
Three score and ten sir
Will we be there by candlelight

Mr Brandes accepts it Stephen said as the first play of the closing period

Does he What does Mr Sidney Lee or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is say of it

Marina Stephen said a child of storm Miranda a wonder Perdita that which was lost What was lost is given back to him his daughters child My dearest wife Pericles says was like this maid Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother

The art of being a grandfather Mr Best gan murmur Lart dtre grand

Will he not see reborn in her with the memory of his own youth added another image

Do you know what you are talking about Love yes Word known to all men Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus 

His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience material and moral Such an appeal will touch him The images of other males of his blood will repel him He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself

The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope

I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public And we ought to mention another Irish commentator Mr George Bernard Shaw Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris His articles on Shakespeare in the Saturday Review were surely brilliant Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets The favoured rival is William Herbert earl of Pembroke I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony withwhat shall I sayour notions of what ought not to have been

Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them auks egg prize of their fray

He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords Dost love Miriam Dost love thy man

That may be too Stephen said Theres a saying of Goethes which Mr Magee likes to quote Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet Why Belief in himself has been untimely killed He was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield I should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down Assumed dongiovannism will not save him No later undoing will undo the first undoing The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her womans invisible weapon There is I feel in the words some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion a darker shadow of the first darkening even his own understanding of himself A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool

They list And in the porches of their ears I pour

The soul has been before stricken mortally a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlets ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator That is why the speech his lean unlovely English is always turned elsewhere backward Ravisher and ravished what he would but would not go with him from Lucreces bluecircled ivory globes to Imogens breast bare with its mole cinquespotted He goes back weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old sore But because loss is his gain he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed His beaver is up He is a ghost a shadow now the wind by Elsinores rocks or what you will the seas voice a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow the son consubstantial with the father

Amen was responded from the doorway

Hast thou found me O mine enemy

Entracte

A ribald face sullen as a deans Buck Mulligan came forward then blithe in motley towards the greeting of their smiles My telegram

You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate if I mistake not he asked of Stephen

Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble

They make him welcome Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen

He lifts his hands Veils fall O flowers Bells with bells with bells aquiring

Yes indeed the quaker librarian said A most instructive discussion Mr Mulligan Ill be bound has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare All sides of life should be represented

He smiled on all sides equally

Buck Mulligan thought puzzled

Shakespeare he said I seem to know the name

A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features

To be sure he said remembering brightly The chap that writes like Synge

Mr Best turned to him

Haines missed you he said Did you meet him Hell see you after at the D B C Hes gone to Gills to buy Hydes Lovesongs of Connacht

I came through the museum Buck Mulligan said Was he here

The bards fellowcountrymen John Eglinton answered are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin Vining held that the prince was a woman Has noone made him out to be an Irishman Judge Barton I believe is searching for some clues He swears His Highness not His Lordship by saint Patrick

The most brilliant of all is that story of Wildes Mr Best said lifting his brilliant notebook That Portrait of Mr W H where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes a man all hues

For Willie Hughes is it not the quaker librarian asked

Or Hughie Wills Mr William Himself W H who am I

I mean for Willie Hughes Mr Best said amending his gloss easily Of course its all paradox dont you know Hughes and hews and hues the colour but its so typical the way he works it out Its the very essence of Wilde dont you know The light touch

His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled a blond ephebe Tame essence of Wilde

Youre darned witty Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasys ducats

How much did I spend O a few shillings

For a plump of pressmen Humour wet and dry

Wit You would give your five wits for youths proud livery he pranks in Lineaments of gratified desire

There be many mo Take her for me In pairing time Jove a cool ruttime send them Yea turtledove her

Eve Naked wheatbellied sin A snake coils her fang ins kiss

Do you think it is only a paradox the quaker librarian was asking The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious

They talked seriously of mockers seriousness

Buck Mulligans again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile Then his head wagging he came near drew a folded telegram from his pocket His mobile lips read smiling with new delight

Telegram he said Wonderful inspiration Telegram A papal bull

He sat on a corner of the unlit desk reading aloud joyfully

The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done Signed Dedalus Where did you launch it from The kips No College Green Have you drunk the four quid The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father Telegram Malachi Mulligan The Ship lower Abbey street O you peerless mummer O you priestified Kinchite

Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue

Its what Im telling you mister honey its queer and sick we were Haines and myself the time himself brought it in Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar Im thinking and he limp with leching And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connerys sitting civil waiting for pints apiece

He wailed

And we to be there mavrone and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful

Stephen laughed

Quickly warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down

The tramper Synge is looking for you he said to murder you He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule Hes out in pampooties to murder you

Me Stephen exclaimed That was your contribution to literature

Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling

Murder you he laughed

Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue SaintAndrdesArts In words of words for words palabras Oisin with Patrick Faunman he met in Clamart woods brandishing a winebottle Cest vendredi saint Murthering Irish His image wandering he met I mine I met a fool ithe forest

Mr Lyster an attendant said from the door ajar

 in which everyone can find his own So Mr Justice Madden in his Diary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms Yes What is it

Theres a gentleman here sir the attendant said coming forward and offering a card From the Freeman He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year

Certainly certainly certainly Is the gentleman

He took the eager card glanced not saw laid down unglanced looked asked creaked asked

Is he O there

Brisk in a galliard he was off out In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal in duty bound most fair most kind most honest broadbrim

This gentleman Freemans Journal Kilkenny People To be sure Good day sir Kilkenny We have certainly

A patient silhouette waited listening

All the leading provincial Northern Whig Cork Examiner Enniscorthy Guardian 1903 Will you please Evans conduct this gentleman If you just follow the atten Or please allow me This way Please sir

Voluble dutiful he led the way to all the provincial papers a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels

The door closed

The sheeny Buck Mulligan cried

He jumped up and snatched the card

Whats his name Ikey Moses Bloom

He rattled on

Jehovah collector of prepuces is no more I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer Every day we must do homage to her Life of life thy lips enkindle

Suddenly he turned to Stephen

He knows you He knows your old fellow O I fear me he is Greeker than the Greeks His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove Venus Kallipyge O the thunder of those loins The god pursuing the maiden hid

We want to hear more John Eglinton decided with Mr Bests approval We begin to be interested in Mrs S Till now we had thought of her if at all as a patient Griselda a Penelope stayathome

Antisthenes pupil of Gorgias Stephen said took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus brooddam Argive Helen the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept and handed it to poor Penelope Twenty years he lived in London and during part of that time he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland His life was rich His art more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it is the art of surfeit Hot herringpies green mugs of sack honeysauces sugar of roses marchpane gooseberried pigeons ringocandies Sir Walter Raleigh when they arrested him had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures You know Manninghams story of the burghers wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard III and how Shakespeare overhearing without more ado about nothing took the cow by the horns and when Burbage came knocking at the gate answered from the capons blankets William the conqueror came before Richard III And the gay lakin mistress Fitton mount and cry O and his dainty birdsnies lady Penelope Rich a clean quality woman is suited for a player and the punks of the bankside a penny a time

Cours la Reine Encore vingt sous Nous ferons de petites cochonneries Minette Tu veux

The height of fine society And sir William Davenant of Oxfords mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary

Buck Mulligan his pious eyes upturned prayed

Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock

And Harry of six wives daughter And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson gentleman poet sings But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes

Do and do Thing done In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard herbalist he walks greyedauburn An azured harebell like her veins Lids of Junos eyes violets He walks One life is all One body Do But do Afar in a reek of lust and squalor hands are laid on whiteness

Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglintons desk sharply

Whom do you suspect he challenged

Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets Once spurned twice spurned But the court wanton spurned him for a lord his dearmylove

Love that dare not speak its name

As an Englishman you mean John sturdy Eglinton put in he loved a lord

Old wall where sudden lizards flash At Charenton I watched them

It seems so Stephen said when he wants to do for him and for all other and singular uneared wombs the holy office an ostler does for the stallion Maybe like Socrates he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife But she the giglot wanton did not break a bedvow Two deeds are rank in that ghosts mind a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined deceased husbands brother Sweet Ann I take it was hot in the blood Once a wooer twice a wooer

Stephen turned boldly in his chair

The burden of proof is with you not with me he said frowning If you deny that in the fifth scene of Hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him All those women saw their men down and under Mary her goodman John Ann her poor dear Willun when he went and died on her raging that he was the first to go Joan her four brothers Judith her husband and all her sons Susan her husband too while Susans daughter Elizabeth to use granddaddys words wed her second having killed her first

O yes mention there is In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her fathers shepherd Explain you then Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity

He faced their silence

To whom thus Eglinton You mean the will
But that has been explained I believe by jurists
She was entitled to her widows dower
At common law His legal knowledge was great
Our judges tell us
            Him Satan fleers
Mocker
            And therefore he left out her name
From the first draft but he did not leave out
The presents for his granddaughter for his daughters
For his sister for his old cronies in Stratford
And in London And therefore when he was urged
As I believe to name her
He left her his
Secondbest

Woa

Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then John Eglinton observed as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type

He was a rich country gentleman Stephen said with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard a capitalist shareholder a bill promoter a tithefarmer Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace

It is clear that there were two beds a best and a secondbest Mr Secondbest Best said finely

Separatio a mensa et a thalamo bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on

Antiquity mentions famous beds Second Eglinton puckered bedsmiling Let me think

Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage Stephen said who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves pays tribute to his elders wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress dont forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis and let her live in his villa

Do you mean he died so Mr Best asked with slight concern I mean

He died dead drunk Buck Mulligan capped A quart of ale is a dish for a king O I must tell you what Dowden said

What asked Besteglinton

William Shakespeare and company limited The peoples William For terms apply E Dowden Highfield house

Lovely Buck Mulligan suspired amorously I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard He lifted his hands and said All we can say is that life ran very high in those days Lovely

Catamite

The sense of beauty leads us astray said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton

Steadfast John replied severe

The doctor can tell us what those words mean You cannot eat your cake and have it

Sayest thou so Will they wrest from us from me the palm of beauty

And the sense of property Stephen said He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent How else could Aubreys ostler and callboy get rich quick All events brought grist to his mill Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queens leech Lopez his jews heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive Hamlet and Macbeth with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting The lost armada is his jeer in Loves Labour Lost His pageants the histories sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porters theory of equivocation The Sea Venture comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban our American cousin The sugared sonnets follow Sidneys As for fay Elizabeth otherwise carrotty Bess the gross virgin who inspired The Merry Wives of Windsor let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket

I think youre getting on very nicely Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological Mingo minxi mictum mingere

Prove that he was a jew John Eglinton dared expectantly Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman

Sufflaminandus sum

He was made in Germany Stephen replied as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals

A myriadminded man Mr Best reminded Coleridge called him myriadminded

Amplius In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos

Saint Thomas Stephen began

Ora pro nobis Monk Mulligan groaned sinking to a chair

There he keened a wailing rune

Pogue mahone Acushla machree Its destroyed we are from this day Its destroyed we are surely

All smiled their smiles

Saint Thomas Stephen smiling said whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who it may be hungers for it Jews whom christians tax with avarice are of all races the most given to intermarriage Accusations are made in anger The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews for whom as for the lollards storm was shelter bound their affections too with hoops of steel Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass

Or his jennyass Buck Mulligan antiphoned

Gentle Will is being roughly handled gentle Mr Best said gently

Which will gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan We are getting mixed

The will to live John Eglinton philosophised for poor Ann Wills widow is the will to die

Requiescat Stephen prayed

What of all the will to do
It has vanished long ago

She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed the mobled queen even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes In old age she takes up with gospellers one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask and heard she had a soul She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the Merry Wives and loosing her nightly waters on the jordan she thought over Hooks and Eyes for Believers Breeches and The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze Venus has twisted her lips in prayer Agenbite of inwit remorse of conscience It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god

History shows that to be true inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos The ages succeed one another But we have it on high authority that a mans worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family I feel that Russell is right What do we care for his wife or father I should say that only family poets have family lives Falstaff was not a family man I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation

Lean he lay back Shy deny thy kindred the unco guid Shy supping with the godless he sneaks the cup A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him Visits him here on quarter days Mr Magee sir theres a gentleman to see you Me Says hes your father sir Give me my Wordsworth Enter Magee Mor Matthew a rugged rough rugheaded kern in strossers with a buttoned codpiece his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests a wand of wilding in his hand

Your own He knows your old fellow The widower

Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched his hand The voice new warmth speaking Dr Bob Kenny is attending her The eyes that wish me well But do not know me

A father Stephen said battling against hopelessness is a necessary evil He wrote the play in the months that followed his fathers death If you hold that he a greying man with two marriageable daughters with thirtyfive years of life nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita with fifty of experience is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen No The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night From hour to hour it rots and rots He rests disarmed of fatherhood having devised that mystical estate upon his son Boccaccios Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child Fatherhood in the sense of conscious begetting is unknown to man It is a mystical estate an apostolic succession from only begetter to only begotten On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded like the world macro and microcosm upon the void Upon incertitude upon unlikelihood Amor matris subjective and objective genitive may be the only true thing in life Paternity may be a legal fiction Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son

Sabellius the African subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field held that the Father was Himself His Own Son The bulldog of Aquin with whom no word shall be impossible refutes him Well if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote Hamlet he was not the father of his own son merely but being no more a son he was and felt himself the father of all his race the father of his own grandfather the father of his unborn grandson who by the same token never was born for nature as Mr Magee understands her abhors perfection

Eglintoneyes quick with pleasure looked up shybrightly Gladly glancing a merry puritan through the twisted eglantine

Flatter Rarely But flatter

Himself his own father Sonmulligan told himself Wait I am big with child I have an unborn child in my brain Pallas Athena A play The plays the thing Let me parturiate

He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands

As for his family Stephen said his mothers name lives in the forest of Arden Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in Coriolanus His boysons death is the deathscene of young Arthur in King John Hamlet the black prince is Hamnet Shakespeare Who the girls in The Tempest in Pericles in Winters Tale are we know Who Cleopatra fleshpot of Egypt and Cressid and Venus are we may guess But there is another member of his family who is recorded

The plot thickens John Eglinton said

The quaker librarian quaking tiptoed in quake his mask quake with haste quake quack

Door closed Cell Day

They list Three They

I you he they

Come mess

STEPHEN He had three brothers Gilbert Edmund Richard Gilbert in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man ons back The playhouse sausage filled Gilberts soul He is nowhere but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William

MAGEEGLINJOHN Names Whats in a name

BUCKMULLIGAN Piano diminuendo

Then outspoke medical Dick
To his comrade medical Davy

STEPHEN In his trinity of black Wills the villain shakebags Iago Richard Crookback Edmund in King Lear two bear the wicked uncles names Nay that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark

BEST I hope Edmund is going to catch it I dont want Richard my name 

Laughter

QUAKERLYSTER A tempo But he that filches from me my good name

STEPHEN Stringendo He has hidden his own name a fair name William in the plays a super here a clown there as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus Like John oGaunt his name is dear to him as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent honorificabilitudinitatibus dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country Whats in a name That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours A star a daystar a firedrake rose at his birth It shone by day in the heavens alone brighter than Venus in the night and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars His eyes watched it lowlying on the horizon eastward of the bear as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms

Both satisfied I too

Dont tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched

And from her arms

What is that Mr Dedalus the quaker librarian asked Was it a celestial phenomenon

A star by night Stephen said A pillar of the cloud by day

What mores to speak

Stephen looked on his hat his stick his boots

Stephanos my crown My sword His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet Buy a pair Holes in my socks Handkerchief too

You make good use of the name John Eglinton allowed Your own name is strange enough I suppose it explains your fantastical humour

Me Magee and Mulligan

Fabulous artificer The hawklike man You flew Whereto NewhavenDieppe steerage passenger Paris and back Lapwing Icarus Pater ait Seabedabbled fallen weltering Lapwing you are Lapwing be

Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say

Thats very interesting because that brother motive dont you know we find also in the old Irish myths Just what you say The three brothers Shakespeare In Grimm too dont you know the fairytales The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize

Best of Best brothers Good better best

The quaker librarian springhalted near

I should like to know he said which brother you I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers But perhaps I am anticipating

He caught himself in the act looked at all refrained

An attendant from the doorway called

Mr Lyster Father Dineen wants

O Father Dineen Directly

Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone

John Eglinton touched the foil

Come he said Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund You kept them for the last didnt you

In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund Stephen answered I feel I am asking too much perhaps A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella

Lapwing

Where is your brother Apothecaries hall My whetstone Him then Cranly Mulligan now these Speech speech But act Act speech They mock to try you Act Be acted on

Lapwing

I am tired of my voice the voice of Esau My kingdom for a drink

On

You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays Why did he take them rather than others Richard a whoreson crookback misbegotten makes love to a widowed Ann whats in a name woos and wins her a whoreson merry widow Richard the conqueror third brother came after William the conquered The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeares reverence the angel of the world Why is the underplot of King Lear in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidneys Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history

That was Wills way John Eglinton defended We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith Que voulezvous Moore would say He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle

Why Stephen answered himself Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare what the poor are not always with him The note of banishment banishment from the heart banishment from home sounds uninterruptedly from The Two Gentlemen of Verona onward till Prospero breaks his staff buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book It doubles itself in the middle of his life reflects itself in another repeats itself protasis epitasis catastasis catastrophe It repeats itself again when he is near the grave when his married daughter Susan chip of the old block is accused of adultery But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth An original sin and like original sin committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned It is between the lines of his last written words it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid Age has not withered it Beauty and peace have not done it away It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created in Much Ado about Nothing twice in As you like It in The Tempest in Hamlet in Measure for Measureand in all the other plays which I have not read

He laughed to free his mind from his minds bondage

Judge Eglinton summed up

The truth is midway he affirmed He is the ghost and the prince He is all in all

He is Stephen said The boy of act one is the mature man of act five All in all In Cymbeline in Othello he is bawd and cuckold He acts and is acted on Lover of an ideal or a perversion like Jos he kills the real Carmen His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer

Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly O word of fear

Dark dome received reverbed

And what a character is Iago undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed When all is said Dumas fils or is it Dumas pre is right After God Shakespeare has created most

Man delights him not nor woman neither Stephen said He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born where he has always been man and boy a silent witness and there his journey of life ended he plants his mulberrytree in the earth Then dies The motion is ended Gravediggers bury Hamlet pre and Hamlet fils A king and a prince at last in death with incidental music And what though murdered and betrayed bewept by all frail tender hearts for Dane or Dubliner sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced If you like the epilogue look long on it prosperous Prospero the good man rewarded Lizzie grandpas lump of love and nuncle Richie the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go Strong curtain He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible Maeterlinck says If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend Every life is many days day after day We walk through ourselves meeting robbers ghosts giants old men young men wives widows brothersinlove but always meeting ourselves The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly He gave us light first and the sun two days later the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call dio boia hangman god is doubtless all in all in all of us ostler and butcher and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven foretold by Hamlet there are no more marriages glorified man an androgynous angel being a wife unto himself

Eureka Buck Mulligan cried Eureka

Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglintons desk

May I he said The Lord has spoken to Malachi

He began to scribble on a slip of paper

Take some slips from the counter going out

Those who are married Mr Best douce herald said all save one shall live The rest shall keep as they are

He laughed unmarried at Eglinton Johannes of arts a bachelor

Unwed unfancied ware of wiles they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of The Taming of the Shrew

You are a delusion said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle Do you believe your own theory

No Stephen said promptly

Are you going to write it Mr Best asked You ought to make it a dialogue dont you know like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote

John Eclecticon doubly smiled

Well in that case he said I dont see why you should expect payment for it since you dont believe it yourself Dowden believes there is some mystery in Hamlet but will say no more Herr Bleibtreu the man Piper met in Berlin who is working up that Rutland theory believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument He is going to visit the present duke Piper says and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays It will come as a surprise to his grace But he believes his theory

I believe O Lord help my unbelief That is help me to believe or help me to unbelieve Who helps to believe Egomen Who to unbelieve Other chap

You are the only contributor to Dana who asks for pieces of silver Then I dont know about the next number Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics

For a guinea Stephen said you can publish this interview

Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling laughing and then gravely said honeying malice

I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra Gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies Fresh Nelly and Rosalie the coalquay whore

He broke away

Come Kinch Come wandering ngus of the birds

Come Kinch You have eaten all we left Ay I will serve you your orts and offals

Stephen rose

Life is many days This will end

We shall see you tonight John Eglinton said Notre ami Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there

Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama

Monsieur Moore he said lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland Ill be there Come Kinch the bards must drink Can you walk straight

Laughing he

Swill till eleven Irish nights entertainment

Lubber

Stephen followed a lubber

One day in the national library we had a discussion Shakes After His lub back I followed I gall his kibe

Stephen greeting then all amort followed a lubber jester a wellkempt head newbarbered out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought

What have I learned Of them Of me

Walk like Haines now

The constant readers room In the readers book Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables Item was Hamlet mad The quakers pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk

O please do sir I shall be most pleased

Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself selfnodding

A pleased bottom

The turnstile

Is that Blueribboned hat Idly writing What Looked

The curving balustrade smoothsliding Mincius

Puck Mulligan panamahelmeted went step by step iambing trolling

John Eglinton my jo John
Why wont you wed a wife

He spluttered to the air

O the chinless Chinaman Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton We went over to their playbox Haines and I the plumbers hall Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M Maeterlinck Abbey Theatre I smell the pubic sweat of monks

He spat blank

Forgot any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him And left the femme de trente ans And why no other children born And his first child a girl

Afterwit Go back

The dour recluse still there he has his cake and the douce youngling minion of pleasure Phedos toyable fair hair

Eh I just eh wanted I forgot he

Longworth and MCurdy Atkinson were there

Puck Mulligan footed featly trilling

I hardly hear the purlieu cry
Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by
Before my thoughts begin to run
On F MCurdy Atkinson
The same that had the wooden leg
And that filibustering filibeg
That never dared to slake his drouth
Magee that had the chinless mouth
Being afraid to marry on earth
They masturbated for all they were worth

Jest on Know thyself

Halted below me a quizzer looks at me I halt

Mournful mummer Buck Mulligan moaned Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature Only crows priests and English coal are black

A laugh tripped over his lips

Longworth is awfully sick he said after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus Couldnt you do the Yeats touch

He went on and down mopping chanting with waving graceful arms

The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time One thinks of Homer

He stopped at the stairfoot

I have conceived a play for the mummers he said solemnly

The pillared Moorish hall shadows entwined Gone the nine mens morrice with caps of indices

In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet

Everyman His Own Wife
or
A Honeymoon in the Hand
a national immorality in three orgasms
by
Ballocky Mulligan

He turned a happy patchs smirk to Stephen saying

The disguise I fear is thin But listen

He read marcato

Characters

     TOBY TOSTOFF a ruined Pole
     CRAB a bushranger
     MEDICAL DICK 
         and       two birds with one stone
     MEDICAL DAVY 
     MOTHER GROGAN a watercarrier
     FRESH NELLY
         and
     ROSALIE the coalquay whore

He laughed lolling a to and fro head walking on followed by Stephen and mirthfully he told the shadows souls of men

O the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured multicoloured multitudinous vomit

The most innocent son of Erin Stephen said for whom they ever lifted them

About to pass through the doorway feeling one behind he stood aside

Part The moment is now Where then If Socrates leave his house today if Judas go forth tonight Why That lies in space which I in time must come to ineluctably

My will his will that fronts me Seas between

A man passed out between them bowing greeting

Good day again Buck Mulligan said

The portico

Here I watched the birds for augury ngus of the birds They go they come Last night I flew Easily flew Men wondered Street of harlots after A creamfruit melon he held to me In You will see

The wandering jew Buck Mulligan whispered with clowns awe Did you see his eye He looked upon you to lust after you I fear thee ancient mariner O Kinch thou art in peril Get thee a breechpad

Day Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge

A dark back went before them step of a pard down out by the gateway under portcullis barbs

They followed

Offend me still Speak on

Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street No birds Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended pluming and in a flaw of softness softly were blown

Cease to strive Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline hierophantic from wide earth an altar

The superior the very reverend John Conmee S J reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps Five to three Just nice time to walk to Artane What was that boys name again Dignam Yes Vere dignum et iustum est Brother Swan was the person to see Mr Cunninghams letter Yes Oblige him if possible Good practical catholic useful at mission time

A onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches growled some notes He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S J Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held he knew one silver crown

Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square He thought but not for long of soldiers and sailors whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs ending their days in some pauper ward and of cardinal Wolseys words If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy MP

Very well indeed father And you father

Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed He would go to Buxton probably for the waters And her boys were they getting on well at Belvedere Was that so Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that And Mr Sheehy himself Still in London The house was still sitting to be sure it was Beautiful weather it was delightful indeed Yes it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach O yes a very great success A wonderful man really

Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy MP Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy MP Yes he would certainly call

Good afternoon Mrs Sheehy

Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled as he took leave at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun And smiled yet again in going He had cleaned his teeth he knew with arecanut paste

Father Conmee walked and walking smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughans droll eyes and cockney voice

Pilate Wy dont you old back that owlin mob

A zealous man however Really he was And really did great good in his way Beyond a doubt He loved Ireland he said and he loved the Irish Of good family too would one think it Welsh were they not

O lest he forget That letter to father provincial

Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square Yes they were from Belvedere The little house Aha And were they good boys at school O That was very good now And what was his name Jack Sohan And his name Ger Gallaher And the other little man His name was Brunny Lynam O that was a very nice name to have

Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street

But mind you dont post yourself into the box little man he said

The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed

O sir

Well let me see if you can post a letter Father Conmee said

Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmees letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east

Mr Denis J Maginni professor of dancing c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignams court

Was that not Mrs MGuinness

Mrs MGuinness stately silverhaired bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed And Father Conmee smiled and saluted How did she do

A fine carriage she had Like Mary queen of Scots something And to think that she was a pawnbroker Well now Such a what should he say such a queenly mien

Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left The reverend T R Greene BA will DV speak The incumbent they called him He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words But one should be charitable Invincible ignorance They acted according to their lights

Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare Surely there ought to be

A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street All raised untidy caps Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly Christian brother boys

Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked Saint Josephs church Portland row For aged and virtuous females Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament Virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered

Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman And now it was an office or something

Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter He passed Grogans the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York In America those things were continually happening Unfortunate people to die like that unprepared Still an act of perfect contrition

Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergins publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged They saluted him and were saluted

Father Conmee passed H J ONeills funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable In Youkstetters the porkbutchers Father Conmee observed pigs puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes

Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him It was idyllic and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people

On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S J of saint Francis Xaviers church upper Gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram

Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C C of saint Agathas church north William street on to Newcomen bridge

At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island

Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum

It was a peaceful day The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down His wife Father Conmee supposed A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses She raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly

Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat

Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head

At Annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her She passed out with her basket and a marketnet and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and Father Conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been absolved pray for me But they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures

From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee

Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S J and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night That book by the Belgian jesuit Le Nombre des lus seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not DV been brought But they were Gods souls created by God It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say

At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn

The Malahide road was quiet It pleased Father Conmee road and name The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide Lord Talbot de Malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining Then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day Those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony

Father Conmee walking thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort daughter of lord Molesworth first countess of Belvedere

A listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough Ennel Mary first countess of Belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged Who could know the truth Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husbands brother She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did Only God knew and she and he her husbands brother

Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for mans race on earth and of the ways of God which were not our ways

Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore He was humane and honoured there He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by Don John Conmee

It was a charming day

The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind Moutonner the French said A just and homely word

Father Conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field He walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening He was their rector his reign was mild

Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out An ivory bookmark told him the page

Nones He should have read that before lunch But lady Maxwell had come

Father Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast Deus in adiutorium

He walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati Principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustiti tu

A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand The young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig

Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary Sin Principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum

        

Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner He pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out

Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge

Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed his hat downtilted chewing his blade of hay

Constable 57C on his beat stood to pass the time of day

Thats a fine day Mr Kelleher

Ay Corny Kelleher said

Its very close the constable said

Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin

Whats the best news he asked

I seen that particular party last evening the constable said with bated breath

        

A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnells corner skirting Rabaiottis icecream car and jerked himself up Eccles street Towards Larry ORourke in shirtsleeves in his doorway he growled unamiably

For England

He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus halted and growled

home and beauty

J J OMolloys white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor

A stout lady stopped took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her The sailor grumbled thanks glanced sourly at the unheeding windows sank his head and swung himself forward four strides

He halted and growled angrily

For England

Two barefoot urchins sucking long liquorice laces halted near him gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths

He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks halted lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply

home and beauty

The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two ceased The blind of the window was drawn aside A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell A plump bare generous arm shone was seen held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps A womans hand flung forth a coin over the area railings It fell on the path

One of the urchins ran to it picked it up and dropped it into the minstrels cap saying

There sir

        

Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen

Did you put in the books Boody asked

Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow

They wouldnt give anything on them she said

Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble

Where did you try Boody asked

MGuinnesss

Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table

Bad cess to her big face she cried

Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes

Whats in the pot she asked

Shirts Maggy said

Boody cried angrily

Crickey is there nothing for us to eat

Katey lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt asked

And whats in this

A heavy fume gushed in answer

Peasoup Maggy said

Where did you get it Katey asked

Sister Mary Patrick Maggy said

The lacquey rang his bell

Barang

Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily

Give us it here

Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl Katey sitting opposite Boody said quietly as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs

A good job we have that much Wheres Dilly

Gone to meet father Maggy said

Boody breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup added

Our father who art not in heaven

Maggy pouring yellow soup in Kateys bowl exclaimed

Boody For shame

A skiff a crumpled throwaway Elijah is coming rode lightly down the Liffey under Loopline bridge shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains between the Customhouse old dock and Georges quay

        

The blond girl in Thorntons bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar

Put these in first will you he said

Yes sir the blond girl said And the fruit on top

Thatll do game ball Blazes Boylan said

She bestowed fat pears neatly head by tail and among them ripe shamefaced peaches

Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop lifting fruits young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes sniffing smells

H E L YS filed before him tallwhitehatted past Tangier lane plodding towards their goal

He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chains length

Can you send them by tram Now

A darkbacked figure under Merchants arch scanned books on the hawkers cart

Certainly sir Is it in the city

O yes Blazes Boylan said Ten minutes

The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil

Will you write the address sir

Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her

Send it at once will you he said Its for an invalid

Yes sir I will sir

Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers pocket

Whats the damage he asked

The blond girls slim fingers reckoned the fruits

Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse A young pullet He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass

This for me he asked gallantly

The blond girl glanced sideways at him got up regardless with his tie a bit crooked blushing

Yes sir she said

Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches

Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth

May I say a word to your telephone missy he asked roguishly

        

Ma Almidano Artifoni said

He gazed over Stephens shoulder at Goldsmiths knobby poll

Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly their women sitting fore gripping the handrests Palefaces Mens arms frankly round their stunted forms They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed

Anchio ho avuto di queste idee Almidano Artifoni said quand ero giovine come Lei Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo  una bestia  peccato Perch la sua voce sarebbe un cespite di rendita via Invece Lei si sacrifica

Sacrifizio incruento Stephen said smiling swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint lightly

Speriamo the round mustachioed face said pleasantly Ma dia retta a me Ci rifletta

By the stern stone hand of Grattan bidding halt an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band

Ci rifletter Stephen said glancing down the solid trouserleg

Ma sul serio eh Almidano Artifoni said

His heavy hand took Stephens firmly Human eyes They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram

Eccolo Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi Addio caro

Arrivederla maestro Stephen said raising his hat when his hand was freed E grazie

Di che Almidano Artifoni said Scusi eh Tante belle cose

Almidano Artifoni holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram In vain he trotted signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates

        

Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter

Too much mystery business in it Is he in love with that one Marion Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye

The disk shot down the groove wobbled a while ceased and ogled them six

Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard

16 June 1904

Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypenys corner and the slab where Wolfe Tones statue was not eeled themselves turning H E L YS and plodded back as they had come

Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall charming soubrette and listlessly lolling scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses Mustard hair and dauby cheeks Shes not nicelooking is she The way shes holding up her bit of a skirt Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagles They kick out grand Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her Hope to goodness he wont keep me here till seven

The telephone rang rudely by her ear

Hello Yes sir No sir Yes sir Ill ring them up after five Only those two sir for Belfast and Liverpool All right sir Then I can go after six if youre not back A quarter after Yes sir Twentyseven and six Ill tell him Yes one seven six

She scribbled three figures on an envelope

Mr Boylan Hello That gentleman from Sport was in looking for you Mr Lenehan yes He said hell be in the Ormond at four No sir Yes sir Ill ring them up after five

        

Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch

Whos that Ned Lambert asked Is that Crotty

Ringabella and Crosshaven a voice replied groping for foothold

Hello Jack is that yourself Ned Lambert said raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches Come on Mind your steps there

The vesta in the clergymans uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall At their feet its red speck died and mouldy air closed round them

How interesting a refined accent said in the gloom

Yes sir Ned Lambert said heartily We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Marys abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534 This is the most historic spot in all Dublin OMadden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road You were never here before Jack were you

No Ned

He rode down through Dame walk the refined accent said if my memory serves me The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court

Thats right Ned Lambert said Thats quite right sir

If you will be so kind then the clergyman said the next time to allow me perhaps

Certainly Ned Lambert said Bring the camera whenever you like Ill get those bags cleared away from the windows You can take it from here or from here

In the still faint light he moved about tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor

From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard

Im deeply obliged Mr Lambert the clergyman said I wont trespass on your valuable time

Youre welcome sir Ned Lambert said Drop in whenever you like Next week say Can you see

Yes yes Good afternoon Mr Lambert Very pleased to have met you

Pleasure is mine sir Ned Lambert answered

He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars With J J OMolloy he came forth slowly into Marys abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal OConnor Wexford

He stood to read the card in his hand

The reverend Hugh C Love Rathcoffey Present address Saint Michaels Sallins Nice young chap he is Hes writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me Hes well up in history faith

The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig

I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot J J OMolloy said

Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air

God he cried I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral You know that one Im bloody sorry I did it says he but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside He mightnt like it though What God Ill tell him anyhow That was the great earl the Fitzgerald Mor Hot members they were all of them the Geraldines

The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried

Woa sonny

He turned to J J OMolloy and asked

Well Jack What is it Whats the trouble Wait awhile Hold hard

With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and after an instant sneezed loudly

Chow he said Blast you

The dust from those sacks J J OMolloy said politely

No Ned Lambert gasped I caught a cold night before blast your soul night before last and there was a hell of a lot of draught

He held his handkerchief ready for the coming

I was Glasnevin this morning poor little what do you call him Chow Mother of Moses

        

Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat

See he said Say its turn six In here see Turn Now On

He slid it into the left slot for them It shot down the groove wobbled a while ceased ogling them six

Lawyers of the past haughty pleading beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of kings bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude

See he said See now the last one I put in is over here Turns Over The impact Leverage see

He showed them the rising column of disks on the right

Smart idea Nosey Flynn said snuffling So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over

See Tom Rochford said

He slid in a disk for himself and watched it shoot wobble ogle stop four Turn Now On

Ill see him now in the Ormond Lenehan said and sound him One good turn deserves another

Do Tom Rochford said Tell him Im Boylan with impatience

Goodnight MCoy said abruptly When you two begin

Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever snuffling at it

But how does it work here Tommy he asked

Tooraloo Lenehan said See you later

He followed MCoy out across the tiny square of Crampton court

Hes a hero he said simply

I know MCoy said The drain you mean

Drain Lenehan said It was down a manhole

They passed Dan Lowrys musichall where Marie Kendall charming soubrette smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile

Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed MCoy how the whole thing was One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it half choked with sewer gas Down went Tom Rochford anyhow bookys vest and all with the rope round him And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up

The act of a hero he said

At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street

This way he said walking to the right I want to pop into Lynams to see Sceptres starting price Whats the time by your gold watch and chain

MCoy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses sombre office then at ONeills clock

After three he said Whos riding her

O Madden Lenehan said And a game filly she is

While he waited in Temple bar MCoy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark

The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade

Even money Lenehan said returning I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasnt an earthly Through here

They went up the steps and under Merchants arch A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawkers cart

There he is Lenehan said

Wonder what hes buying MCoy said glancing behind

Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye Lenehan said

Hes dead nuts on sales MCoy said I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob There were fine plates in it worth double the money the stars and the moon and comets with long tails Astronomy it was about

Lenehan laughed

Ill tell you a damn good one about comets tails he said Come over in the sun

They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall

Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangans late Fehrenbachs carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks

There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory Lenehan said eagerly The annual dinner you know Boiled shirt affair The lord mayor was there Val Dillon it was and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music Bartell dArcy sang and Benjamin Dollard

I know MCoy broke in My missus sang there once

Did she Lenehan said

A card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street

He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh

But wait till I tell you he said Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher Bloom and the wife were there Lashings of stuff we put up port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice Fast and furious it was After liquids came solids Cold joints galore and mince pies

I know MCoy said The year the missus was there

Lenehan linked his arm warmly

But wait till I tell you he said We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue oclock the morning after the night before Coming home it was a gorgeous winters night on the Featherbed Mountain Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other We started singing glees and duets Lo the early beam of morning She was well primed with a good load of Delahunts port under her bellyband Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me Hells delights She has a fine pair God bless her Like that

He held his caved hands a cubit from him frowning

I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time Know what I mean

His hands moulded ample curves of air He shut his eyes tight in delight his body shrinking and blew a sweet chirp from his lips

The lad stood to attention anyhow he said with a sigh Shes a gamey mare and no mistake Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey the great bear and Hercules and the dragon and the whole jingbang lot But by God I was lost so to speak in the milky way He knows them all faith At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away And what star is that Poldy says she By God she had Bloom cornered That one is it says Chris Callinan sure thats only what you might call a pinprick By God he wasnt far wide of the mark

Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall panting with soft laughter

Im weak he gasped

MCoys white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave Lenehan walked on again He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly He glanced sideways in the sunlight at MCoy

Hes a cultured allroundman Bloom is he said seriously Hes not one of your common or garden you know Theres a touch of the artist about old Bloom

        

Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk then of Aristotles Masterpiece Crooked botched print Plates infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world All butting with their skulls to get out of it Child born every minute somewhere Mrs Purefoy

He laid both books aside and glanced at the third Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch

That I had he said pushing it by

The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter

Them are two good ones he said

Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth He bent to make a bundle of the other books hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain

On OConnell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni professor of dancing c

Mr Bloom alone looked at the titles Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch Know the kind that is Had it Yes

He opened it Thought so

A womans voice behind the dingy curtain Listen the man

No she wouldnt like that much Got her it once

He read the other title Sweets of Sin More in her line Let us see

He read where his finger opened

All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies For him For Raoul

Yes This Here Try

Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her dshabill

Yes Take this The end

You are late he spoke hoarsely eying her with a suspicious glare

The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly

Mr Bloom read again The beautiful woman

Warmth showered gently over him cowing his flesh Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes whites of eyes swooning up His nostrils arched themselves for prey Melting breast ointments for him For Raoul Armpits oniony sweat Fishgluey slime her heaving embonpoint Feel Press Crished Sulphur dung of lions

Young Young

An elderly female no more young left the building of the courts of chancery kings bench exchequer and common pleas having heard in the lord chancellors court the case in lunacy of Potterton in the admiralty division the summons exparte motion of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation

Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop bulging out the dingy curtains The shopmans uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face coughing He raked his throat rudely puked phlegm on the floor He put his boot on what he had spat wiping his sole along it and bent showing a rawskinned crown scantily haired

Mr Bloom beheld it

Mastering his troubled breath he said

Ill take this one

The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum

Sweets of Sin he said tapping on it Thats a good one

        

The lacquey by the door of Dillons auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet

Dilly Dedalus loitering by the curbstone heard the beats of the bell the cries of the auctioneer within Four and nine Those lovely curtains Five shillings Cosy curtains Selling new at two guineas Any advance on five shillings Going for five shillings

The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it

Barang

Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint J A Jackson W E Wylie A Munro and H T Gahan their stretched necks wagging negotiated the curve by the College library

Mr Dedalus tugging a long moustache came round from Williamss row He halted near his daughter

Its time for you she said

Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus Mr Dedalus said Are you trying to imitate your uncle John the cornetplayer head upon shoulder Melancholy God

Dilly shrugged her shoulders Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back

Stand up straight girl he said Youll get curvature of the spine Do you know what you look like

He let his head sink suddenly down and forward hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw

Give it up father Dilly said All the people are looking at you

Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache

Did you get any money Dilly asked

Where would I get money Mr Dedalus said There is noone in Dublin would lend me fourpence

You got some Dilly said looking in his eyes

How do you know that Mr Dedalus asked his tongue in his cheek

Mr Kernan pleased with the order he had booked walked boldly along Jamess street

I know you did Dilly answered Were you in the Scotch house now

I was not then Mr Dedalus said smiling Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy Here

He handed her a shilling

See if you can do anything with that he said

I suppose you got five Dilly said Give me more than that

Wait awhile Mr Dedalus said threateningly Youre like the rest of them are you An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died But wait awhile Youll all get a short shrift and a long day from me Low blackguardism Im going to get rid of you Wouldnt care if I was stretched out stiff Hes dead The man upstairs is dead

He left her and walked on Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat

Well what is it he said stopping

The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs

Barang

Curse your bloody blatant soul Mr Dedalus cried turning on him

The lacquey aware of comment shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly

Bang

Mr Dedalus stared at him

Watch him he said Its instructive I wonder will he allow us to talk

You got more than that father Dilly said

Im going to show you a little trick Mr Dedalus said Ill leave you all where Jesus left the jews Look theres all I have I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral

He drew forth a handful of copper coins nervously

Cant you look for some money somewhere Dilly said

Mr Dedalus thought and nodded

I will he said gravely I looked all along the gutter in OConnell street Ill try this one now

Youre very funny Dilly said grinning

Here Mr Dedalus said handing her two pennies Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something Ill be home shortly

He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on

The viceregal cavalcade passed greeted by obsequious policemen out of Parkgate

Im sure you have another shilling Dilly said

The lacquey banged loudly

Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently

The little nuns Nice little things O sure they wouldnt do anything O sure they wouldnt really Is it little sister Monica

        

From the sundial towards Jamess gate walked Mr Kernan pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson boldly along Jamess street past Shackletons offices Got round him all right How do you do Mr Crimmins First rate sir I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico How are things going Just keeping alive Lovely weather were having Yes indeed Good for the country Those farmers are always grumbling Ill just take a thimbleful of your best gin Mr Crimmins A small gin sir Yes sir Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion Terrible terrible A thousand casualties And heartrending scenes Men trampling down women and children Most brutal thing What do they say was the cause Spontaneous combustion Most scandalous revelation Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst What I cant understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that Now youre talking straight Mr Crimmins You know why Palm oil Is that a fact Without a doubt Well now look at that And America they say is the land of the free I thought we were bad here

I smiled at him America I said quietly just like that What is it The sweepings of every country including our own Isnt that true Thats a fact

Graft my dear sir Well of course where theres money going theres always someone to pick it up

Saw him looking at my frockcoat Dress does it Nothing like a dressy appearance Bowls them over

Hello Simon Father Cowley said How are things

Hello Bob old man Mr Dedalus answered stopping

Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy hairdresser Stylish coat beyond a doubt Scott of Dawson street Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it Never built under three guineas Fits me down to the ground Some Kildare street club toff had it probably John Mulligan the manager of the Hibernian bank gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me

Aham Must dress the character for those fellows Knight of the road Gentleman And now Mr Crimmins may we have the honour of your custom again sir The cup that cheers but not inebriates as the old saying has it

North wall and sir John Rogersons quay with hulls and anchorchains sailing westward sailed by a skiff a crumpled throwaway rocked on the ferrywash Elijah is coming

Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image High colour of course Grizzled moustache Returned Indian officer Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet squaring his shoulders Is that Ned Lamberts brother over the way Sam What Yes Hes as like it as damn it No The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there Just a flash like that Damn like him

Aham Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath Good drop of gin that was His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut

Down there Emmet was hanged drawn and quartered Greasy black rope Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenants wife drove by in her noddy

Bad times those were Well well Over and done with Great topers too Fourbottle men

Let me see Is he buried in saint Michans Or no there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall Dignam is there now Went out in a puff Well well Better turn down here Make a detour

Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinnesss visitors waitingroom Outside the Dublin Distillers Companys stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood the reins knotted to the wheel Damn dangerous thing Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens Runaway horse

Denis Breen with his tomes weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Mentons office led his wife over OConnell bridge bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward

Mr Kernan approached Island street

Times of the troubles Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement Gaming at Dalys No cardsharping then One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr Stables behind Moira house

Damn good gin that was

Fine dashing young nobleman Good stock of course That ruffian that sham squire with his violet gloves gave him away Course they were on the wrong side They rose in dark and evil days Fine poem that is Ingram They were gentlemen Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly Masterly rendition

At the siege of Ross did my father fall

A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed outriders leaping leaping in their in their saddles Frockcoats Cream sunshades

Mr Kernan hurried forward blowing pursily

His Excellency Too bad Just missed that by a hair Damn it What a pity

        

Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidarys fingers prove a timedulled chain Dust webbed the window and the showtrays Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver lozenges of cinnabar on rubies leprous and winedark stones

Born all in the dark wormy earth cold specks of fire evil lights shining in the darkness Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows Muddy swinesnouts hands root and root gripe and wrest them

She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic A sailorman rustbearded sips from a beaker rum and eyes her A long and seafed silent rut She dances capers wagging her sowish haunches and her hips on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg

Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem turned it and held it at the point of his Moses beard Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard

And you who wrest old images from the burial earth The brainsick words of sophists Antisthenes A lore of drugs Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road one with a sanded tired umbrella one with a midwifes bag in which eleven cockles rolled

The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on Beingless beings Stop Throb always without you and the throb always within Your heart you sing of I between them Where Between two roaring worlds where they swirl I Shatter them one and both But stun myself too in the blow Shatter me you who can Bawd and butcher were the words I say Not yet awhile A look around

Yes quite true Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time You say right sir A Monday morning twas so indeed

Stephen went down Bedford row the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade In Clohisseys window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists And they are throbbing heroes hearts

He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart

Twopence each the huckster said Four for sixpence

Tattered pages The Irish Beekeeper Life and Miracles of the Cur of Ars Pocket Guide to Killarney

I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes Stephano Dedalo alumno optimo palmam ferenti

Father Conmee having read his little hours walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney murmuring vespers

Binding too good probably What is this Eighth and ninth book of Moses Secret of all secrets Seal of King David Thumbed pages read and read Who has passed here before me How to soften chapped hands Recipe for white wine vinegar How to win a womans love For me this Say the following talisman three times with hands folded

Se el yilo nebrakada femininum Amor me solo Sanktus Amen

Who wrote this Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged As good as any other abbots charms as mumbling Joachims Down baldynoddle or well wool your wool

What are you doing here Stephen

Dillys high shoulders and shabby dress

Shut the book quick Dont let see

What are you doing Stephen said

A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles lank locks falling at its sides It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots I told her of Paris Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats fingering a pinchbeck bracelet Dan Kellys token Nebrakada femininum

What have you there Stephen asked

I bought it from the other cart for a penny Dilly said laughing nervously Is it any good

My eyes they say she has Do others see me so Quick far and daring Shadow of my mind

He took the coverless book from her hand Chardenals French primer

What did you buy that for he asked To learn French

She nodded reddening and closing tight her lips

Show no surprise Quite natural

Here Stephen said Its all right Mind Maggy doesnt pawn it on you I suppose all my books are gone

Some Dilly said We had to

She is drowning Agenbite Save her Agenbite All against us She will drown me with her eyes and hair Lank coils of seaweed hair around me my heart my soul Salt green death

Hello Simon Father Cowley said How are things

Hello Bob old man Mr Dedalus answered stopping

They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughters Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand

Whats the best news Mr Dedalus said

Why then not much Father Cowley said Im barricaded up Simon with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance

Jolly Mr Dedalus said Who is it

O Father Cowley said A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance

With a broken back is it Mr Dedalus asked

The same Simon Father Cowley answered Reuben of that ilk Im just waiting for Ben Dollard Hes going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off All I want is a little time

He looked with vague hope up and down the quay a big apple bulging in his neck

I know Mr Dedalus said nodding Poor old bockedy Ben Hes always doing a good turn for someone Hold hard

He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant

There he is by God he said arse and pockets

Ben Dollards loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge He came towards them at an amble scratching actively behind his coattails

As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted

Hold that fellow with the bad trousers

Hold him now Ben Dollard said

Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollards figure Then turning to Father Cowley with a nod he muttered sneeringly

Thats a pretty garment isnt it for a summers day

Why God eternally curse your soul Ben Dollard growled furiously I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw

He stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff saying

They were made for a man in his health Ben anyhow

Bad luck to the jewman that made them Ben Dollard said Thanks be to God hes not paid yet

And how is that basso profondo Benjamin Father Cowley asked

Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell murmuring glassyeyed strode past the Kildare street club

Ben Dollard frowned and making suddenly a chanters mouth gave forth a deep note

Aw he said

Thats the style Mr Dedalus said nodding to its drone

What about that Ben Dollard said Not too dusty What

He turned to both

Thatll do Father Cowley said nodding also

The reverend Hugh C Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Marys abbey past James and Charles Kennedys rectifiers attended by Geraldines tall and personable towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles

Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward his joyful fingers in the air

Come along with me to the subsheriffs office he said I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff Hes a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun Hes well worth seeing mind you Come along I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I dont Wait awhile Were on the right lay Bob believe you me

For a few days tell him Father Cowley said anxiously

Ben Dollard halted and stared his loud orifice open a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright

What few days he boomed Hasnt your landlord distrained for rent

He has Father Cowley said

Then our friends writ is not worth the paper its printed on Ben Dollard said The landlord has the prior claim I gave him all the particulars 29 Windsor avenue Love is the name

Thats right Father Cowley said The reverend Mr Love Hes a minister in the country somewhere But are you sure of that

You can tell Barabbas from me Ben Dollard said that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts

He led Father Cowley boldly forward linked to his bulk

Filberts I believe they were Mr Dedalus said as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront following them

        

The youngster will be all right Martin Cunningham said as they passed out of the Castleyard gate

The policeman touched his forehead

God bless you Martin Cunningham said cheerily

He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street

Bronze by gold Miss Kennedys head by Miss Douces head appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel

Yes Martin Cunningham said fingering his beard I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him

You could try our friend Mr Power suggested backward

Boyd Martin Cunningham said shortly Touch me not

John Wyse Nolan lagging behind reading the list came after them quickly down Cork hill

On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti descending hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending

The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street

Look here Martin John Wyse Nolan said overtaking them at the Mail office I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings

Quite right Martin Cunningham said taking the list And put down the five shillings too

Without a second word either Mr Power said

Strange but true Martin Cunningham added

John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes

Ill say there is much kindness in the jew he quoted elegantly

They went down Parliament street

Theres Jimmy Henry Mr Power said just heading for Kavanaghs

Righto Martin Cunningham said Here goes

Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooneys brotherinlaw humpy tight making for the liberties

John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly with hasty steps past Micky Andersons watches

The assistant town clerks corns are giving him some trouble John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power

They followed round the corner towards James Kavanaghs winerooms The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate Martin Cunningham speaking always showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance

And long John Fanning is here too John Wyse Nolan said as large as life

The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood

Good day Mr Subsheriff Martin Cunningham said as all halted and greeted

Long John Fanning made no way for them He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces

Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk

Hell open to christians they were having Jimmy Henry said pettishly about their damned Irish language Where was the marshal he wanted to know to keep order in the council chamber And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma no mace on the table nothing in order no quorum even and Hutchinson the lord mayor in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him Damned Irish language language of our forefathers

Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips

Martin Cunningham spoke by turns twirling the peak of his beard to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff while John Wyse Nolan held his peace

What Dignam was that long John Fanning asked

Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot

O my corns he said plaintively Come upstairs for goodness sake till I sit down somewhere Uff Ooo Mind

Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fannings flank and passed in and up the stairs

Come on up Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff I dont think you knew him or perhaps you did though

With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in

Decent little soul he was Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror

Rather lowsized Dignam of Mentons office that was Martin Cunningham said

Long John Fanning could not remember him

Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air

Whats that Martin Cunningham said

All turned where they stood John Wyse Nolan came down again From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes not quickly In saddles of the leaders leaping leaders rode outriders

What was it Martin Cunningham asked as they went on up the staircase

The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot

        

As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines

Parnells brother There in the corner

They chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard

Is that he Haines asked twisting round in his seat

Yes Mulligan said Thats John Howard his brother our city marshal

John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested An instant after under its screen his eyes looked quickly ghostbright at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner

Ill take a mlange Haines said to the waitress

Two mlanges Buck Mulligan said And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well

When she had gone he said laughing

We call it DBC because they have damn bad cakes O but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet

Haines opened his newbought book

Im sorry he said Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance

The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street

England expects

Buck Mulligans primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter

You should see him he said when his body loses its balance Wandering ngus I call him

I am sure he has an ide fixe Haines said pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be Such persons always have

Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely

They drove his wits astray he said by visions of hell He will never capture the Attic note The note of Swinburne of all poets the white death and the ruddy birth That is his tragedy He can never be a poet The joy of creation

Eternal punishment Haines said nodding curtly I see I tackled him this morning on belief There was something on his mind I saw Its rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that

Buck Mulligans watchful eyes saw the waitress come He helped her to unload her tray

He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth Haines said amid the cheerful cups The moral idea seems lacking the sense of destiny of retribution Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea Does he write anything for your movement

He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith He bit off a soft piece hungrily

Ten years he said chewing and laughing He is going to write something in ten years

Seems a long way off Haines said thoughtfully lifting his spoon Still I shouldnt wonder if he did after all

He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup

This is real Irish cream I take it he said with forbearance I dont want to be imposed on

Elijah skiff light crumpled throwaway sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers amid an archipelago of corks beyond new Wapping street past Bensons ferry and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks

        

Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street past Sewells yard Behind him Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smiths house and crossing walked along Merrion square Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park

Cashel Boyle OConnor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werners cheerful windows then turned and strode back along Merrion square his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling

At the corner of Wildes house he halted frowned at Elijahs name announced on the Metropolitan hall frowned at the distant pleasance of dukes lawn His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun With ratsteeth bared he muttered

Coactus volui

He strode on for Clare street grinding his fierce word

As he strode past Mr Blooms dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards having buffeted a thewless body The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form

Gods curse on you he said sourly whoever you are Youre blinder nor I am you bitchs bastard

        

Opposite Ruggy ODonohoes Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam pawing the pound and a half of Mangans late Fehrenbachs porksteaks he had been sent for went along warm Wicklow street dawdling It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunneys And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake jawing the whole blooming time and sighing

After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle courtdress milliner stopped him He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently Myler Keogh Dublins pet lamb will meet sergeantmajor Bennett the Portobello bruiser for a purse of fifty sovereigns Gob thatd be a good pucking match to see Myler Keogh thats the chap sparring out to him with the green sash Two bar entrance soldiers half price I could easy do a bunk on ma Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned Thats me in mourning When is it May the twentysecond Sure the blooming thing is all over He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned his cap awry his collar sticking up Buttoning it down his chin lifted he saw the image of Marie Kendall charming soubrette beside the two puckers One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out

Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week man But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him dodging and all

In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toffs mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time

No Sandymount tram

Master Dignam walked along Nassau street shifted the porksteaks to his other hand His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt blooming end to it He met schoolboys with satchels Im not going tomorrow either stay away till Monday He met other schoolboys Do they notice Im in mourning Uncle Barney said hed get it into the paper tonight Then theyll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pas name

His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs

Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend A big coffin it was and high and heavylooking How was that The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunneys for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt Never see him again Death that is Pa is dead My father is dead He told me to be a good son to ma I couldnt hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better Poor pa That was Mr Dignam my father I hope hes in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night

Begin

Bronze by gold miss Douces head by miss Kennedys head over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by ringing steel

Is that her asked miss Kennedy

Miss Douce said yes sitting with his ex pearl grey and eau de Nil

Exquisite contrast miss Kennedy said

When all agog miss Douce said eagerly

Look at the fellow in the tall silk

Who Where gold asked more eagerly

In the second carriage miss Douces wet lips said laughing in the sun

Hes looking Mind till I see

She darted bronze to the backmost corner flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath

Her wet lips tittered

Hes killed looking back

She laughed

O wept Arent men frightful idiots

With sadness

Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light twining a loose hair behind an ear Sauntering sadly gold no more she twisted twined a hair Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear

Its them has the fine times sadly then she said

A man

Bloowho went by by Moulangs pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin by Wines antiques in memory bearing sweet sinful words by Carrolls dusky battered plate for Raoul

The boots to them them in the bar them barmaids came For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china And

Theres your teas he said

Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate safe from eyes low

What is it loud boots unmannerly asked

Find out miss Douce retorted leaving her spyingpoint

Your beau is it

A haughty bronze replied

Ill complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence

Imperthnthn thnthnthn bootssnout sniffed rudely as he retreated as she threatened as he had come

Bloom

On her flower frowning miss Douce said

Most aggravating that young brat is If he doesnt conduct himself Ill wring his ear for him a yard long

Ladylike in exquisite contrast

Take no notice miss Kennedy rejoined

She poured in a teacup tea then back in the teapot tea They cowered under their reef of counter waiting on footstools crates upturned waiting for their teas to draw They pawed their blouses both of black satin two and nine a yard waiting for their teas to draw and two and seven

Yes bronze from anear by gold from afar heard steel from anear hoofs ring from afar and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel

Am I awfully sunburnt

Miss bronze unbloused her neck

No said miss Kennedy It gets brown after Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water

Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell

And leave it to my hands she said

Try it with the glycerine miss Kennedy advised

Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce

Those things only bring out a rash replied reseated I asked that old fogey in Boyds for something for my skin

Miss Kennedy pouring now a fulldrawn tea grimaced and prayed

O dont remind me of him for mercy sake

But wait till I tell you miss Douce entreated

Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers

No dont she cried

I wont listen she cried

But Bloom

Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogeys tone

For your what says he

Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear to speak but said but prayed again

Dont let me think of him or Ill expire The hideous old wretch That night in the Antient Concert Rooms

She sipped distastefully her brew hot tea a sip sipped sweet tea

Here he was miss Douce said cocking her bronze head three quarters ruffling her nosewings Hufa Hufa

Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedys throat Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest

O shrieking miss Kennedy cried Will you ever forget his goggle eye

Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter shouting

And your other eye

Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatners name Why do I always think Figather Gathering figs I think And Prosper Lors huguenot name By Bassis blessed virgins Blooms dark eyes went by Bluerobed white under come to me God they believe she is or goddess Those today I could not see That fellow spoke A student After with Dedalus son He might be Mulligan All comely virgins That brings those rakes of fellows in her white

By went his eyes The sweets of sin Sweet are the sweets

Of sin

In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended Douce with Kennedy your other eye They threw young heads back bronze gigglegold to let freefly their laughter screaming your other signals to each other high piercing notes

Ah panting sighing sighing ah fordone their mirth died down

Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again raised drank a sip and gigglegiggled Miss Douce bending over the teatray ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes Again Kennygiggles stooping her fair pinnacles of hair stooping her tortoise napecomb showed spluttered out of her mouth her tea choking in tea and laughter coughing with choking crying

O greasy eyes Imagine being married to a man like that she cried With his bit of beard

Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell a full yell of full woman delight joy indignation

Married to the greasy nose she yelled

Shrill with deep laughter after gold after bronze they urged each each to peal after peal ringing in changes bronzegold goldbronze shrilldeep to laughter after laughter And then laughed more Greasy I knows Exhausted breathless their shaken heads they laid braided and pinnacled by glossycombed against the counterledge All flushed O panting sweating O all breathless

Married to Bloom to greaseabloom

O saints above miss Douce said sighed above her jumping rose I wished I hadnt laughed so much I feel all wet

O miss Douce miss Kennedy protested You horrid thing

And flushed yet more you horrid more goldenly

By Cantwells offices roved Greaseabloom by Ceppis virgins bright of their oils Nannettis father hawked those things about wheedling at doors as I Religion pays Must see him for that par Eat first I want Not yet At four she said Time ever passing Clockhands turning On Where eat The Clarence Dolphin On For Raoul Eat If I net five guineas with those ads The violet silk petticoats Not yet The sweets of sin

Flushed less still less goldenly paled

Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus Chips picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails Chips He strolled

O welcome back miss Douce

He held her hand Enjoyed her holidays

Tiptop

He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor

Gorgeous she said Look at the holy show I am Lying out on the strand all day

Bronze whiteness

That was exceedingly naughty of you Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently Tempting poor simple males

Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away

O go away she said Youre very simple I dont think

He was

Well now I am he mused I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon

You must have been a doaty miss Douce made answer And what did the doctor order today

Well now he mused whatever you say yourself I think Ill trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky

Jingle

With the greatest alacrity miss Douce agreed

With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochranes she turned herself With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe Alacrity she served He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes

By Jove he mused I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains Must be a great tonic in the air down there But a long threatening comes at last they say Yes Yes

Yes He fingered shreds of hair her maidenhair her mermaids into the bowl Chips Shreds Musing Mute

None nought said nothing Yes

Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler trilling

O Idolores queen of the eastern seas

Was Mr Lidwell in today

In came Lenehan Round him peered Lenehan Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge Yes Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex To Martha I must write Buy paper Dalys Girl there civil Bloom Old Bloom Blue bloom is on the rye

He was in at lunchtime miss Douce said

Lenehan came forward

Was Mr Boylan looking for me

He asked She answered

Miss Kennedy was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs

She asked Miss voice of Kennedy answered a second teacup poised her gaze upon a page

No He was not

Miss gaze of Kennedy heard not seen read on Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round

Peep Whos in the corner

No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures To mind her stops To read only the black ones round o and crooked ess

Jingle jaunty jingle

Girlgold she read and did not glance Take no notice She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her plappering flatly

Ah fox met ah stork Said thee fox too thee stork Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone

He droned in vain Miss Douce turned to her tea aside

He sighed aside

Ah me O my

He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod

Greetings from the famous son of a famous father

Who may he be Mr Dedalus asked

Lenehan opened most genial arms Who

Who may he be he asked Can you ask Stephen the youthful bard

Dry

Mr Dedalus famous father laid by his dry filled pipe

I see he said I didnt recognise him for the moment I hear he is keeping very select company Have you seen him lately

He had

I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day said Lenehan In Mooneys en ville and in Mooneys sur mer He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse

He smiled at bronzes teabathed lips at listening lips and eyes

The lite of Erin hung upon his lips The ponderous pundit Hugh MacHugh Dublins most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the OMadden Burke

After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and

That must have been highly diverting said he I see

He see He drank With faraway mourning mountain eye Set down his glass

He looked towards the saloon door

I see you have moved the piano

The tuner was in today miss Douce replied tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player

Is that a fact

Didnt he miss Kennedy The real classical you know And blind too poor fellow Not twenty Im sure he was

Is that a fact Mr Dedalus said

He drank and strayed away

So sad to look at his face miss Douce condoled

Gods curse on bitchs bastard

Tink to her pity cried a diners bell To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat came bothered Pat came Pat waiter of Ormond Lager for diner Lager without alacrity she served

With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience for jinglejaunty blazes boy

Upholding the lid he who gazed in the coffin coffin at the oblique triple piano wires He pressed the same who pressed indulgently her hand soft pedalling a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing to hear the muffled hammerfall in action

For men

In drowsy silence gold bent on her page

From the saloon a call came long in dying That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck A call again That he now poised that it now throbbed You hear It throbbed pure purer softly and softlier its buzzing prongs Longer in dying call

Pat paid for diners popcorked bottle and over tumbler tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered bald and bothered with miss Douce

The bright stars fade

A voiceless song sang from within singing

 the morn is breaking

A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands Brightly the keys all twinkling linked all harpsichording called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn of youth of loves leavetaking lifes loves morn

The dewdrops pearl

Lenehans lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy

But look this way he said rose of Castile

Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped

She rose and closed her reading rose of Castile fretted forlorn dreamily rose

Did she fall or was she pushed he asked her

She answered slighting

Ask no questions and youll hear no lies

Like lady ladylike

Blazes Boylans smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode Yes gold from anear by bronze from afar Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him

See the conquering hero comes

Between the car and window warily walking went Bloom unconquered hero See me he might The seat he sat on warm Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Gouldings legal bag lifted aloft saluting

And I from thee

I heard you were round said Blazes Boylan

He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw She smiled on him But sister bronze outsmiled her preening for him her richer hair a bosom and a rose

Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon stretching her satin arm her bust that all but burst so high

O O jerked Lenehan gasping at each stretch O

But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph

Why dont you grow asked Blazes Boylan

Shebronze dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips looked as it flowed flower in his coat who gave him and syrupped with her voice

Fine goods in small parcels

That is to say she Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe

Heres fortune Blazes said

He pitched a broad coin down Coin rang

Hold on said Lenehan till I

Fortune he wished lifting his bubbled ale

Sceptre will win in a canter he said

I plunged a bit said Boylan winking and drinking Not on my own you know Fancy of a friend of mine

Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douces lips that all but hummed not shut the oceansong her lips had trilled Idolores The eastern seas

Clock whirred Miss Kennedy passed their way flower wonder who gave bearing away teatray Clock clacked

Miss Douce took Boylans coin struck boldly the cashregister It clanged Clock clacked Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change Look to the west A clack For me

She smilesmirked supercilious wept arent men but lightward gliding mild she smiled on Boylan

Youre the essence of vulgarity she in gliding said

Boylan eyed eyed Tossed to fat lips his chalice drank off his chalice tiny sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops His spellbound eyes went after after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors gilded arch for ginger ale hock and claret glasses shimmering a spiky shell where it concerted mirrored bronze with sunnier bronze

Yes bronze from anearby

 Sweetheart goodbye

He slid his chalice brisk away grasped his change

Wait a shake begged Lenehan drinking quickly I wanted to tell you Tom Rochford

Seven days in jail Ben Dollard said on bread and water Then youd sing Simon like a garden thrush

Lionel Simon singer laughed Father Bob Cowley played Mina Kennedy served Second gentleman paid Tom Kernan strutted in Lydia admired admired But Bloom sang dumb

Admiring

Richie admiring descanted on that mans glorious voice He remembered one night long ago Never forget that night Si sang Twas rank and fame in Ned Lamberts twas Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too

Goulding a flush struggling in his pale told Mr Bloom face of the night Si in Ned Lamberts Dedalus house sang Twas rank and fame

He Mr Bloom listened while he Richie Goulding told him Mr Bloom of the night he Richie heard him Si Dedalus sing Twas rank and fame in his Ned Lamberts house

Brothersinlaw relations We never speak as we pass by Rift in the lute I think Treats him with scorn See He admires him all the more The night Si sang The human voice two tiny silky chords wonderful more than all others

That voice was a lamentation Calmer now Its in the silence after you feel you hear Vibrations Now silent air

Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong He drew and plucked It buzz it twanged While Goulding talked of Barracloughs voice production while Tom Kernan harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley who played a voluntary who nodded as he played While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus lighting who nodded as he smoked who smoked

Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm reproachful pleased

Dont make half so free said she till we are better acquainted

George Lidwell told her really and truly but she did not believe

First gentleman told Mina that was so She asked him was that so And second tankard told her so That that was so

Miss Douce miss Lydia did not believe miss Kennedy Mina did not believe George Lidwell no miss Dou did not the first the first gent with the tank believe no no did not miss Kenn Lidlydiawell the tank

Douce now Douce Lydia Bronze and rose

She had a gorgeous simply gorgeous time And look at the lovely shell she brought

To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he George Lidwell solicitor might hear

Listen she bade him

Under Tom Kernans ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow Authentic fact How Walter Bapty lost his voice Well sir the husband took him by the throat Scoundrel said he Youll sing no more lovesongs He did faith sir Tom Bob Cowley wove Tenors get wom Cowley lay back

Ah now he heard she holding it to his ear Hear He heard Wonderful She held it to her own And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided To hear

Tap

Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears He heard more faintly that that they heard each for herself alone then each for other hearing the plash of waves loudly a silent roar

Bronze by a weary gold anear afar they listened

Her ear too is a shell the peeping lobe there Been to the seaside Lovely seaside girls Skin tanned raw Should have put on coldcream first make it brown Buttered toast O and that lotion mustnt forget Fever near her mouth Your head it simply Hair braided over shell with seaweed Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair And Turks the mouth why Her eyes over the sheet Yashmak Find the way in A cave No admittance except on business

The sea they think they hear Singing A roar The blood it is Souse in the ear sometimes Well its a sea Corpuscle islands

Wonderful really So distinct Again George Lidwell held its murmur hearing then laid it by gently

What are the wild waves saying he asked her smiled

Charming seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled

Lo Joe says I How are you blowing Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush

Soots luck says Joe Whos the old ballocks you were talking to

Old Troy says I was in the force Im on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders

What are you doing round those parts says Joe

Devil a much says I Theres a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken laneold Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about himlifted any Gods quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hopofmythumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street

Circumcised says Joe

Ay says I A bit off the top An old plumber named Geraghty Im hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I cant get a penny out of him

That the lay youre on now says Joe

Ay says I How are the mighty fallen Collector of bad and doubtful debts But thats the most notorious bloody robber youd meet in a days walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain Tell him says he I dare him says he and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does says he Ill have him summonsed up before the court so I will for trading without a licence And he after stuffing himself till hes fit to burst Jesus I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out He drink me my teas He eat me my sugars Because he no pay me my moneys

Come around to Barney Kiernans says Joe I want to see the citizen

Barney mavourneens be it says I Anything strange or wonderful Joe

Not a word says Joe I was up at that meeting in the City Arms

What was that Joe says I

Cattle traders says Joe about the foot and mouth disease I want to give the citizen the hard word about it

So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it Jesus I couldnt get over that bloody foxy Geraghty the daylight robber For trading without a licence says he

In Inisfail the fair there lies a land the land of holy Michan There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept warriors and princes of high renown A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters fishful streams where sport the gurnard the plaice the roach the halibut the gibbed haddock the grilse the dab the brill the flounder the pollock the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage the wafty sycamore the Lebanonian cedar the exalted planetree the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots silvery fishes crans of herrings drafts of eels codlings creels of fingerlings purple seagems and playful insects And heroes voyage from afar to woo them from Eblana to Slievemargy the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachans land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle princes the sons of kings

And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for OConnell Fitzsimon takes toll of them a chieftain descended from chieftains Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields flaskets of cauliflowers floats of spinach pineapple chunks Rangoon beans strikes of tomatoes drums of figs drills of Swedes spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale York and Savoy and trays of onions pearls of the earth and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries pulpy and pelurious and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes

I dare him says he and I doubledare him Come out here Geraghty you notorious bloody hill and dale robber

And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffes prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves and there is ever heard a trampling cackling roaring lowing bleating bellowing rumbling grunting champing chewing of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond from the MGillicuddys reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmers firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds various in size the agate with this dun

So we turned into Barney Kiernans and there sure enough was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel Garryowen and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink

There he is says I in his gloryhole with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers working for the cause

The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog Im told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence

Stand and deliver says he

Thats all right citizen says Joe Friends here

Pass friends says he

Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he

Whats your opinion of the times

Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill But begob Joe was equal to the occasion

I think the markets are on a rise says he sliding his hand down his fork

So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says

Foreign wars is the cause of it

And says Joe sticking his thumb in his pocket

Its the Russians wish to tyrannise

Arrah give over your bloody codding Joe says I Ive a thirst on me I wouldnt sell for half a crown

Give it a name citizen says Joe

Wine of the country says he

Whats yours says Joe

Ditto MacAnaspey says I

Three pints Terry says Joe And hows the old heart citizen says he

Never better a chara says he What Garry Are we going to win Eh

And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and by Jesus he near throttled him

The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse Ulex Europeus The widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble

He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity Cuchulin Conn of hundred battles Niall of nine hostages Brian of Kincora the ardri Malachi Art MacMurragh Shane ONeill Father John Murphy Owen Roe Patrick Sarsfield Red Hugh ODonnell Red Jim MacDermott Soggarth Eoghan OGrowney Michael Dwyer Francy Higgins Henry Joy MCracken Goliath Horace Wheatley Thomas Conneff Peg Woffington the Village Blacksmith Captain Moonlight Captain Boycott Dante Alighieri Christopher Columbus S Fursa S Brendan Marshal MacMahon Charlemagne Theobald Wolfe Tone the Mother of the Maccabees the Last of the Mohicans the Rose of Castile the Man for Galway The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo The Man in the Gap The Woman Who Didnt Benjamin Franklin Napoleon Bonaparte John L Sullivan Cleopatra Savourneen Deelish Julius Caesar Paracelsus sir Thomas Lipton William Tell Michelangelo Hayes Muhammad the Bride of Lammermoor Peter the Hermit Peter the Packer Dark Rosaleen Patrick W Shakespeare Brian Confucius Murtagh Gutenberg Patricio Velasquez Captain Nemo Tristan and Isolde the first Prince of Wales Thomas Cook and Son the Bold Soldier Boy Arrah na Pogue Dick Turpin Ludwig Beethoven the Colleen Bawn Waddler Healy Angus the Culdee Dolly Mount Sidney Parade Ben Howth Valentine Greatrakes Adam and Eve Arthur Wellesley Boss Croker Herodotus Jack the Giantkiller Gautama Buddha Lady Godiva The Lily of Killarney Balor of the Evil Eye the Queen of Sheba Acky Nagle Joe Nagle Alessandro Volta Jeremiah ODonovan Rossa Don Philip OSullivan Beare A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone

So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O as true as Im telling you A goodlooking sovereign

And theres more where that came from says he

Were you robbing the poorbox Joe says I

Sweat of my brow says Joe Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze

I saw him before I met you says I sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cods eye counting up all the guts of the fish

Who comes through Michans land bedight in sable armour OBloom the son of Rory it is he Impervious to fear is Rorys son he of the prudent soul

For the old woman of Princes street says the citizen the subsidised organ The pledgebound party on the floor of the house And look at this blasted rag says he Look at this says he The Irish Independent if you please founded by Parnell to be the workingmans friend Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent and Ill thank you and the marriages

And he starts reading them out

Gordon Barnfield crescent Exeter Redmayne of Iffley Saint Annes on Sea the wife of William T Redmayne of a son Hows that eh Wright and Flint Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett 179 Clapham road Stockwell Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Judes Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest dean of Worcester Eh Deaths Bristow at Whitehall lane London Carr Stoke Newington of gastritis and heart disease Cockburn at the Moat house Chepstow

Ah well says Joe handing round the boose Thanks be to God they had the start of us Drink that citizen

I will says he honourable person

Health Joe says I And all down the form

Ah Ow Dont be talking I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click

And lo as they quaffed their cup of joy a godlike messenger came swiftly in radiant as the eye of heaven a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage fairest of her race

Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barneys snug squeezed up with the laughing And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadnt seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran I didnt know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him unfortunate wretched woman trotting like a poodle I thought Alf would split

Look at him says he Breen Hes traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U p up on it to take a li

And he doubled up

Take a what says I

Libel action says he for ten thousand pounds

O hell says I

The bloody mongrel began to growl thatd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs

Bi i dho husht says he

Who says Joe

Breen says Alf He was in John Henry Mentons and then he went round to Collis and Wards and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriffs for a lark O God Ive a pain laughing U p up The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man

When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy says Joe

Bergan says Bob Doran waking up Is that Alf Bergan

Yes says Alf Hanging Wait till I show you Here Terry give us a pony That bloody old fool Ten thousand pounds You should have seen long Johns eye U p 

And he started laughing

Who are you laughing at says Bob Doran Is that Bergan

Hurry up Terry boy says Alf

Terence ORyan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats cunning as the sons of deathless Leda For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil those cunning brothers lords of the vat

Then did you chivalrous Terence hand forth as to the manner born that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted the soul of chivalry in beauty akin to the immortals

But he the young chief of the OBergans could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port scion of the house of Brunswick Victoria her name Her Most Excellent Majesty by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea queen defender of the faith Empress of India even she who bore rule a victress over many peoples the wellbeloved for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof the pale the dark the ruddy and the ethiop

Whats that bloody freemason doing says the citizen prowling up and down outside

Whats that says Joe

Here you are says Alf chucking out the rhino Talking about hanging Ill show you something you never saw Hangmens letters Look at here

So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket

Are you codding says I

Honest injun says Alf Read them

So Joe took up the letters

Who are you laughing at says Bob Doran

So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bobs a queer chap when the porters up in him so says I just to make talk

Hows Willy Murray those times Alf

I dont know says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam Only I was running after that

With Dignam says Alf

What about Dignam says Bob Doran Whos talking about

Dead says Alf Hes no more dead than you are

Maybe so says Joe They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow

Paddy says Alf

Ay says Joe He paid the debt of nature God be merciful to him

Good Christ says Alf

Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted

In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prly or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tlfn lvtr htkld wtklst and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of My to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was We greet you friends of earth who are still in the body Mind C K doesnt pile it on It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher manager of Messrs H J ONeills popular funeral establishment a personal friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullens to be soled only as the heels were still good He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known

Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction

He is gone from mortal haunts ODignam sun of our morning Fleet was his foot on the bracken Patrick of the beamy brow Wail Banba with your wind and wail O ocean with your whirlwind

There he is again says the citizen staring out

Who says I

Bloom says he Hes on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes

And begob I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again

Little Alf was knocked bawways Faith he was

Good Christ says he I could have sworn it was him

And says Bob Doran with the hat on the back of his poll lowest blackguard in Dublin when hes under the influence

Who said Christ is good

I beg your parsnips says Alf

Is that a good Christ says Bob Doran to take away poor little Willy Dignam

Ah well says Alf trying to pass it off Hes over all his troubles

But Bob Doran shouts out of him

Hes a bloody ruffian I say to take away poor little Willy Dignam

Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didnt want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam true as youre there

The finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character

The tear is bloody near your eye Talking through his bloody hat Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married Mooney the bumbailiffs daughter mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her exposing her person open to all comers fair field and no favour

The noblest the truest says he And hes gone poor little Willy poor little Paddy Dignam

And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven

Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door

Come in come on he wont eat you says the citizen

So Bloom slopes in with his cods eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there

O Christ MKeown says Joe reading one of the letters Listen to this will you

And he starts reading out one

7 Hunter Street
Liverpool

To the High Sheriff of Dublin
            Dublin

Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged

Show us Joe says I

 private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when

Jesus says I

 Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith

The citizen made a grab at the letter

Hold hard says Joe i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he cant get out hoping to be favoured i remain honoured sir my terms is five ginnees

H Rumbold
            Master Barber

And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too says the citizen

And the dirty scrawl of the wretch says Joe Here says he take them to hell out of my sight Alf Hello Bloom says he what will you have

So they started arguing about the point Bloom saying he wouldnt and he couldnt and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well hed just take a cigar Gob hes a prudent member and no mistake

Give us one of your prime stinkers Terry says Joe

And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it

Theyre all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses

And he was telling us theres two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull

In the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor Their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord

So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time Im told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I dont know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on

Theres one thing it hasnt a deterrent effect on says Alf

Whats that says Joe

The poor buggers tool thats being hanged says Alf

That so says Joe

Gods truth says Alf I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady the invincible He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker

Ruling passion strong in death says Joe as someone said

That can be explained by science says Bloom Its only a natural phenomenon dont you see because on account of the

And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon

The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis

So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this that and the other Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him

Give us the paw Give the paw doggy Good old doggy Give the paw here Give us the paw

Arrah bloody end to the paw hed paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs tin he told Terry to bring Gob he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more Near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel

And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and shes far from the land And Bloom of course with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face Phenomenon The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bzique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didnt near roast him its a queer story the old one Blooms wife and Mrs ODowd that kept the hotel Jesus I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat And Bloom with his but dont you see and but on the other hand And sure more be token the lout Im told was in Powers after the blenders round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment Phenomenon

The memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom

Ay ay says Joe

You dont grasp my point says Bloom What I mean is

Sinn Fein says the citizen Sinn Fein amhain The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us

The last farewell was affecting in the extreme From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranzas plaintive muse Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers Lnhn and Mllgn who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirthprovoking fashion Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the days entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite The delegation present in full force consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitpatant the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von SchwanzenbadHodenthaler Countess Marha Virga Kisszony Putrpesthi Hiram Y Bomboost Count Athanatos Karamelopulos Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi Seor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria Hokopoko Harakiri Hi Hung Chang Olaf Kobberkeddelsen Mynheer Trik van Trumps Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch Borus Hupinkoff Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans ChuechliSteuerli Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentgeneralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness An animated altercation in which all took part ensued among the F O T E I as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Irelands patron saint In the course of the argument cannonballs scimitars boomerangs blunderbusses stinkpots meatchoppers umbrellas catapults knuckledusters sandbags lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged The baby policeman Constable MacFadden summoned by special courier from Booterstown quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties The readywitted ninefooters suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F O T E I several of whom were bleeding profusely Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses The objects which included several hundred ladies and gentlemens gold and silver watches were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme

Quietly unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower the Gladiolus Cruentus He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried unsuccessfully to imitateshort painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries hoch banzai eljen zivio chinchin polla kronia hiphip vive Allah amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers was easily distinguishable It was exactly seventeen oclock The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared the commendatores patriarchal sombrero which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi being removed by his medical adviser in attendance Dr Pippi The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater his cassock above his hoary head and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers Messrs John Round and Sons Sheffield a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum colon blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim The housesteward of the amalgamated cats and dogs home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a nicety delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers association as a token of his regard and esteem The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila my own Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment That monster audience simply rocked with delight But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself Big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young Oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in Albions history placed on the finger of his blushing fiance an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds Nay even the stern provostmarshal lieutenantcolonel TomkinMaxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone

God blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down Limehouse way

So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of Ireland Antitreating is about the size of it Gob hed let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before youd ever see the froth of his pint And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolagh entertainment dont be talking Ireland sober is Ireland free And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt

So howandever as I was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me Id train him by kindness so I would if he was my dog Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldnt blind him

Afraid hell bite you says the citizen jeering

No says I But he might take my leg for a lamppost

So he calls the old dog over

Whats on you Garry says he

Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera Such growling you never heard as they let off between them Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws

All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry The exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprises among other achievements the recitation of verse Our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather as a contributor D O C points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication The metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owens verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour

The curse of my curses
Seven days every day
And seven dry Thursdays
On you Barney Kiernan
Has no sup of water
To cool my courage
And my guts red roaring
After Lowrys lights

So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off And Joe asked him would he have another

I will says he a chara to show theres no ill feeling

Gob hes not as green as hes cabbagelooking Arsing around from one pub to another leaving it to your own honour with old Giltraps dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators Entertainment for man and beast And says Joe

Could you make a hole in another pint

Could a swim duck says I

Same again Terry says Joe Are you sure you wont have anything in the way of liquid refreshment says he

Thank you no says Bloom As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham dont you see about this insurance of poor Dignams Martin asked me to go to the house You see he Dignam I mean didnt serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee cant recover on the policy

Holy Wars says Joe laughing thats a good one if old Shylock is landed So the wife comes out top dog what

Well thats a point says Bloom for the wifes admirers

Whose admirers says Joe

The wifes advisers I mean says Bloom

Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagees right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act He was bloody safe he wasnt run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery True as youre there O commend me to an israelite Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery

So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little Willy thats dead to tell her Choking with bloody foolery And shaking Blooms hand doing the tragic to tell her that Shake hands brother Youre a rogue and Im another

Let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time is founded as I hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour But should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness

No rejoined the other I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup

Then suffer me to take your hand said he The goodness of your heart I feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were I to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech

And off with him and out trying to walk straight Boosed at five oclock Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby 14A Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard drinking porter out of teacups And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls Joseph Manuo and talking against the Catholic religion and he serving mass in Adam and Eves when he was young with his eyes shut who wrote the new testament and the old testament and hugging and smugging And the two shawls killed with the laughing picking his pockets the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another How is your testament Have you got an old testament Only Paddy was passing there I tell you what Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her no less and her violets nice as pie doing the little lady Jack Mooneys sister And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples Gob Jack made him toe the line Told him if he didnt patch up the pot Jesus hed kick the shite out of him

So Terry brought the three pints

Here says Joe doing the honours Here citizen

Slan leat says he

Fortune Joe says I Good health citizen

Gob he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks

Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty Alf says Joe

Friend of yours says Alf

Nannan says Joe The mimber

I wont mention any names says Alf

I thought so says Joe I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field M P the cattle traders

Hairy Iopas says the citizen that exploded volcano the darling of all countries and the idol of his own

So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue Because he was up one time in a knackers yard Walking about with his book and pencil heres my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier Mister Knowall Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs ODowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her Couldnt loosen her farting strings but old cods eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it Whats your programme today Ay Humane methods Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesnt cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently Gob hed have a soft hand under a hen

Ga Ga Gara Klook Klook Klook Black Liz is our hen She lays eggs for us When she lays her egg she is so glad Gara Klook Klook Klook Then comes good uncle Leo He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg Ga ga ga ga Gara Klook Klook Klook

Anyhow says Joe Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons

Are you sure says Bloom the councillor is going I wanted to see him as it happens

Well hes going off by the mailboat says Joe tonight

Thats too bad says Bloom I wanted particularly Perhaps only Mr Field is going I couldnt phone No Youre sure

Nannans going too says Joe The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park What do you think of that citizen The Sluagh na hEireann

Mr Cowe Conacre Multifarnham Nat Arising out of the question of my honourable friend the member for Shillelagh may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition

Mr Allfours Tamoshant Con Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that The answer to the honourable members question is in the affirmative

Mr Orelli OReilly Montenotte Nat Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park

Mr Allfours The answer is in the negative

Mr Cowe Conacre Has the right honourable gentlemans famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench O O

Mr Allfours I must have notice of that question

Mr Staylewit Buncombe Ind Dont hesitate to shoot

Ironical opposition cheers

The speaker Order Order

The house rises Cheers

Theres the man says Joe that made the Gaelic sports revival There he is sitting there The man that got away James Stephens The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot What was your best throw citizen

Na bacleis says the citizen letting on to be modest There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow

Put it there citizen says Joe You were and a bloody sight better

Is that really a fact says Alf

Yes says Bloom Thats well known Did you not know that

So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rowers heart violent exercise was bad I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom Look at Bloom Do you see that straw Thats a straw Declare to my aunt hed talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian OCiarnains in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag under the auspices of Sluagh na hEireann on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland for the development of the race The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions After an instructive discourse by the chairman a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue Mr Joseph MCarthy Hynes made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages L Bloom who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis evergreen verses happily too familiar to need recalling here A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself The Irish CarusoGaribaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it His superb highclass vocalism which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions The proceedings then terminated

Amongst the clergy present were the very rev William Delany S J L L D the rt rev Gerald Molloy D D the rev P J Kavanagh C S Sp the rev T Waters C C the rev John M Ivers P P the rev P J Cleary O S F the rev L J Hickey O P the very rev Fr Nicholas O S F C the very rev B Gorman O D C the rev T Maher S J the very rev James Murphy S J the rev John Lavery V F the very rev William Doherty D D the rev Peter Fagan O M the rev T Brangan O S A the rev J Flavin C C the rev M A Hackett C C the rev W Hurley C C the rt rev Mgr MManus V G the rev B R Slattery O M I the very rev M D Scally P P the rev F T Purcell O P the very rev Timothy canon Gorman P P the rev J Flanagan C C The laity included P Fay T Quirke etc etc

Talking about violent exercise says Alf were you at that KeoghBennett match

No says Joe

I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it says Alf

Who Blazes says Joe

And says Bloom

What I meant about tennis for example is the agility and training the eye

Ay Blazes says Alf He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time

We know him says the citizen The traitors son We know what put English gold in his pocket

True for you says Joe

And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood asking Alf

Now dont you think Bergan

Myler dusted the floor with him says Alf Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it Handed him the father and mother of a beating See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping God he gave him one last puck in the wind Queensberry rules and all made him puke what he never ate

It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage Dublins pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pets nose and Myler came on looking groggy The soldier got to business leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennetts jaw The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook the body punch being a fine one The men came to handigrips Myler quickly became busy and got his man under the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes Myler punishing him The Englishman whose right eye was nearly closed took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponents mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennetts stomach flooring him flat It was a knockout clean and clever Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennetts second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight

He knows which side his bread is buttered says Alf I hear hes running a concert tour now up in the north

He is says Joe Isnt he

Who says Bloom Ah yes Thats quite true Yes a kind of summer tour you see Just a holiday

Mrs B is the bright particular star isnt she says Joe

My wife says Bloom Shes singing yes I think it will be a success too Hes an excellent man to organise Excellent

Hoho begob says I to myself says I That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animals chest Blazes doing the tootle on the flute Concert tour Dirty Dan the dodgers son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers Old Whatwhat I called about the poor and water rate Mr Boylan You what The water rate Mr Boylan You whatwhat Thats the bucko thatll organise her take my tip Twixt me and you Caddareesh

Pride of Calpes rocky mount the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air The gardens of Alameda knew her step the garths of olives knew and bowed The chaste spouse of Leopold is she Marion of the bountiful bosoms

And lo there entered one of the clan of the OMolloys a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy his majestys counsel learned in the law and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert

Ten thousand pounds says Alf laughing God Id give anything to hear him before a judge and jury

Was it you did it Alf says Joe The truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you Jimmy Johnson

Me says Alf Dont cast your nasturtiums on my character

Whatever statement you make says Joe will be taken down in evidence against you

Of course an action would lie says J J It implies that he is not compos mentis U p up

Compos your eye says Alf laughing Do you know that hes balmy Look at his head Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn

Yes says J J but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law

Ha ha Alf says Joe

Still says Bloom on account of the poor woman I mean his wife

Pity about her says the citizen Or any other woman marries a half and half

How half and half says Bloom Do you mean he

Half and half I mean says the citizen A fellow thats neither fish nor flesh

Nor good red herring says Joe

That whats I mean says the citizen A pishogue if you know what that is

Begob I saw there was trouble coming And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him bringing down the rain And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellows was pewopener to the pope Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeneys moustaches the signior Brini from Summerhill the eyetallyano papal Zouave to the Holy Father has left the quay and gone to Moss street And who was he tell us A nobody two pair back and passages at seven shillings a week and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world

And moreover says J J a postcard is publication It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v Hole In my opinion an action might lie

Six and eightpence please Who wants your opinion Let us drink our pints in peace Gob we wont be let even do that much itself

Well good health Jack says Ned

Good health Ned says J J

There he is again says Joe

Where says Alf

And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past talking to him like a father trying to sell him a secondhand coffin

How did that Canada swindle case go off says Joe

Remanded says J J

One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro put an ad in the papers saying hed give a passage to Canada for twenty bob What Do you see any green in the white of my eye Course it was a bloody barney What Swindled them all skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath ay and his own kidney too J J was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid

Who tried the case says Joe

Recorder says Ned

Poor old sir Frederick says Alf you can cod him up to the two eyes

Heart as big as a lion says Ned Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and faith hell dissolve in tears on the bench

Ay says Alf Reuben J was bloody lucky he didnt clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley thats minding stones for the corporation there near Butt bridge

And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry

A most scandalous thing This poor hardworking man How many children Ten did you say

Yes your worship And my wife has the typhoid

And the wife with typhoid fever Scandalous Leave the court immediately sir No sir Ill make no order for payment How dare you sir come up before me and ask me to make an order A poor hardworking industrious man I dismiss the case

And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity the daughter of the skies the virgin moon being then in her first quarter it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law There master Courtenay sitting in his own chamber gave his rede and master Justice Andrews sitting without a jury in the probate court weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday vintner deceased versus Livingstone an infant of unsound mind and another And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer And he sat him there about the hour of five oclock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar for every tribe one man of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian there being in all twelve good men and true And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book And they rose in their seats those twelve of Iar and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor

Those are nice things says the citizen coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs

So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe telling him he neednt trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that hed do the devil and all

Because you see says Bloom for an advertisement you must have repetition Thats the whole secret

Rely on me says Joe

Swindling the peasants says the citizen and the poor of Ireland We want no more strangers in our house

O Im sure that will be all right Hynes says Bloom Its just that Keyes you see

Consider that done says Joe

Very kind of you says Bloom

The strangers says the citizen Our own fault We let them come in We brought them in The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here

Decree nisi says J J

And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing a spiders web in the corner behind the barrel and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when

A dishonoured wife says the citizen thats whats the cause of all our misfortunes

And here she is says Alf that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter in all her warpaint

Give us a squint at her says I

And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher Secrets for enlarging your private parts Misconduct of society belle Norman W Tupper wealthy Chicago contractor finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor

O jakers Jenny says Joe how short your shirt is

Theres hair Joe says I Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one what

So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast

Well says the citizen whats the latest from the scene of action What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language

ONolan clad in shining armour low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen how that the grave elders of the most obedient city second of the realm had met them in the tholsel and there after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal had taken solemn counsel whereby they might if so be it might be bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael

Its on the march says the citizen To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois

So J J puts in a word doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation

Their syphilisation you mean says the citizen To hell with them The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores gets No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name Any civilisation they have they stole from us Tonguetied sons of bastards ghosts

The European family says J J

Theyre not European says the citizen I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris You wouldnt see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet daisance

And says John Wyse

Full many a flower is born to blush unseen

And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo

Conspuez les Anglais Perfide Albion

He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu he drank to the undoing of his foes a race of mighty valorous heroes rulers of the waves who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods

Whats up with you says I to Lenehan You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner

Gold cup says he

Who won Mr Lenehan says Terry

Throwaway says he at twenty to one A rank outsider And the rest nowhere

And Basss mare says Terry

Still running says he Were all in a cart Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend

I had half a crown myself says Terry on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me Lord Howard de Waldens

Twenty to one says Lenehan Such is life in an outhouse Throwaway says he Takes the biscuit and talking about bunions Frailty thy name is Sceptre

So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard

Not there my child says he

Keep your pecker up says Joe Shed have won the money only for the other dog

And J J and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word

Some people says Bloom can see the mote in others eyes but they cant see the beam in their own

Raimeis says the citizen Theres noone as blind as the fellow that wont see if you know what that means Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four our lost tribes And our potteries and textiles the finest in the whole world And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross nothing like it in the whole wide world Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen Read Tacitus and Ptolemy even Giraldus Cambrensis Wine peltries Connemara marble silver from Tipperary second to none our farfamed horses even today the Irish hobbies with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they wont deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption

As treeless as Portugal well be soon says John Wyse or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land Larches firs all the trees of the conifer family are going fast I was reading a report of lord Castletowns

Save them says the citizen the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire O

Europe has its eyes on you says Lenehan

The fashionable international world attended en masse this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley Lady Sylvester Elmshade Mrs Barbara Lovebirch Mrs Poll Ash Mrs Holly Hazeleyes Miss Daphne Bays Miss Dorothy Canebrake Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees Mrs Rowan Greene Mrs Helen Vinegadding Miss Virginia Creeper Miss Gladys Beech Miss Olive Garth Miss Blanche Maple Mrs Maud Mahogany Miss Myra Myrtle Miss Priscilla Elderflower Miss Bee Honeysuckle Miss Grace Poplar Miss O Mimosa San Miss Rachel Cedarfrond the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac Miss Timidity Aspenall Mrs Kitty DeweyMosse Miss May Hawthorne Mrs Gloriana Palme Mrs Liana Forrest Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence The bride who was given away by her father the MConifer of the Glands looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze The maids of honour Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer sisters of the bride wore very becoming costumes in the same tone a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman spare that tree at the conclusion of the service On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts beechmast bayleaves catkins of willow ivytod hollyberries mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest

And our eyes are on Europe says the citizen We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped Spanish ale in Galway the winebark on the winedark waterway

And will again says Joe

And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again says the citizen clapping his thigh Our harbours that are empty will be full again Queenstown Kinsale Galway Blacksod Bay Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry Killybegs the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan OReillys and the OKennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself And will again says he when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore none of your Henry Tudors harps no the oldest flag afloat the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond three crowns on a blue field the three sons of Milesius

And he took the last swig out of the pint Moya All wind and piss like a tanyard cat Cows in Connacht have long horns As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he darent show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant

Hear hear to that says John Wyse What will you have

An imperial yeomanry says Lenehan to celebrate the occasion

Half one Terry says John Wyse and a hands up Terry Are you asleep

Yes sir says Terry Small whisky and bottle of Allsop Right sir

Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public Picture of a butting match trying to crack their bloody skulls one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate And another one Black Beast Burned in Omaha Ga A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him Gob they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job

But what about the fighting navy says Ned that keeps our foes at bay

Ill tell you what about it says the citizen Hell upon earth it is Read the revelations thats going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One

So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out howling for his ma and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun

A rump and dozen says the citizen was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern Gods Englishman calls it caning on the breech

And says John Wyse

Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance

Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder

Thats your glorious British navy says the citizen that bosses the earth The fellows that never will be slaves with the only hereditary chamber on the face of Gods earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons Thats the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs

On which the sun never rises says Joe

And the tragedy of it is says the citizen they believe it The unfortunate yahoos believe it

They believe in rod the scourger almighty creator of hell upon earth and in Jacky Tar the son of a gun who was conceived of unholy boast born of the fighting navy suffered under rump and dozen was scarified flayed and curried yelled like bloody hell the third day he arose again from the bed steered into haven sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid

But says Bloom isnt discipline the same everywhere I mean wouldnt it be the same here if you put force against force

Didnt I tell you As true as Im drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp hed try to downface you that dying was living

Well put force against force says the citizen We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea They were driven out of house and home in the black 47 Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro Ay they drove out the peasants in hordes Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage And they will come again and with a vengeance no cravens the sons of Granuaile the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan

Perfectly true says Bloom But my point was

We are a long time waiting for that day citizen says Ned Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala

Ay says John Wyse We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone We gave our best blood to France and Spain the wild geese Fontenoy eh And Sarsfield and ODonnell duke of Tetuan in Spain and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa But what did we ever get for it

The French says the citizen Set of dancing masters Do you know what it is They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland Arent they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pays dinnerparty with perfidious Albion Firebrands of Europe and they always were

Conspuez les Franais says Lenehan nobbling his beer

And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians says Joe havent we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch thats dead

Jesus I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God old Vic with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper

Well says J J We have Edward the peacemaker now

Tell that to a fool says the citizen Theres a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo Edward GuelphWettin

And what do you think says Joe of the holy boys the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majestys racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode The earl of Dublin no less

They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself says little Alf

And says J J

Considerations of space influenced their lordships decision

Will you try another citizen says Joe

Yes sir says he I will

You says Joe

Beholden to you Joe says I May your shadow never grow less

Repeat that dose says Joe

Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about

Persecution says he all the history of the world is full of it Perpetuating national hatred among nations

But do you know what a nation means says John Wyse

Yes says Bloom

What is it says John Wyse

A nation says Bloom A nation is the same people living in the same place

By God then says Ned laughing if thats so Im a nation for Im living in the same place for the past five years

So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he trying to muck out of it

Or also living in different places

That covers my case says Joe

What is your nation if I may ask says the citizen

Ireland says Bloom I was born here Ireland

The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and gob he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner

After you with the push Joe says he taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry

Here you are citizen says Joe Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words

The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh authors of the Book of Ballymote was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces the acme of art wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol a bogoak sceptre a North American puma a far nobler king of beasts than the British article be it said in passing a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill The scenes depicted on the emunctory field showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides Glendalough the lovely lakes of Killarney the ruins of Clonmacnois Cong Abbey Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins Irelands Eye the Green Hills of Tallaght Croagh Patrick the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness Son and Company Limited Lough Neaghs banks the vale of Ovoca Isoldes tower the Mapas obelisk Sir Patrick Duns hospital Cape Clear the glen of Aherlow Lynchs castle the Scotch house Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown Tullamore jail Castleconnel rapids Kilballymacshonakill the cross at Monasterboice Jurys Hotel S Patricks Purgatory the Salmon Leap Maynooth college refectory Curleys hole the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington the rock of Cashel the bog of Allen the Henry Street Warehouse Fingals Caveall these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time

Show us over the drink says I Which is which

Thats mine says Joe as the devil said to the dead policeman

And I belong to a race too says Bloom that is hated and persecuted Also now This very moment This very instant

Gob he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar

Robbed says he Plundered Insulted Persecuted Taking what belongs to us by right At this very moment says he putting up his fist sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle

Are you talking about the new Jerusalem says the citizen

Im talking about injustice says Bloom

Right says John Wyse Stand up to it then with force like men

Thats an almanac picture for you Mark for a softnosed bullet Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun Gob hed adorn a sweepingbrush so he would if he only had a nurses apron on him And then he collapses all of a sudden twisting around all the opposite as limp as a wet rag

But its no use says he Force hatred history all that Thats not life for men and women insult and hatred And everybody knows that its the very opposite of that that is really life

What says Alf

Love says Bloom I mean the opposite of hatred I must go now says he to John Wyse Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there If he comes just say Ill be back in a second Just a moment

Whos hindering you And off he pops like greased lightning

A new apostle to the gentiles says the citizen Universal love

Well says John Wyse Isnt that what were told Love your neighbour

That chap says the citizen Beggar my neighbour is his motto Love moya Hes a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet

Love loves to love love Nurse loves the new chemist Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle M B loves a fair gentleman Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow Jumbo the elephant loves Alice the elephant Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen Mrs Norman W Tupper loves officer Taylor You love a certain person And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody

Well Joe says I your very good health and song More power citizen

Hurrah there says Joe

The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you says the citizen

And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle

We know those canters says he preaching and picking your pocket What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon The bible Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief thats visiting England

Whats that says Joe

So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out

A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate in the course of a happy speech freely translated by the British chaplain the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible the volume of the word of God and the secret of Englands greatness graciously presented to him by the white chief woman the great squaw Victoria with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak surnamed Forty Warts after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors book subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks amid hilarious applause from the girl hands

Widow woman says Ned I wouldnt doubt her Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would

Same only more so says Lenehan And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly

Is that by Griffith says John Wyse

No says the citizen Its not signed Shanganagh Its only initialled P

And a very good initial too says Joe

Thats how its worked says the citizen Trade follows the flag

Well says J J if theyre any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad Did you read that report by a man whats this his name is

Casement says the citizen Hes an Irishman

Yes thats the man says J J Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them

I know where hes gone says Lenehan cracking his fingers

Who says I

Bloom says he The courthouse is a blind He had a few bob on Throwaway and hes gone to gather in the shekels

Is it that whiteeyed kaffir says the citizen that never backed a horse in anger in his life

Thats where hes gone says Lenehan I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on Hes the only man in Dublin has it A dark horse

Hes a bloody dark horse himself says Joe

Mind Joe says I Show us the entrance out

There you are says Terry

Goodbye Ireland Im going to Gort So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob hundred shillings to five while I was letting off my Throwaway twenty to letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his two pints off of Joe and one in Slatterys off in his mind to get off the mark to hundred shillings is five quid and when they were in the dark horse pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick gob must have done about a gallon flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube shes better or shes ow all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or Jesus full up I was trading without a licence ow Ireland my nation says he hoik phthook never be up to those bloody theres the last of it Jerusalem ah cuckoos

So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries Robbing Peter to pay Paul Gob that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show Give us a bloody chance God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout Mr Bloom with his argol bargol And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds old Methusalem Bloom the robbing bagman that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds Loans by post on easy terms Any amount of money advanced on note of hand Distance no object No security Gob hes like Lanty MacHales goat thatd go a piece of the road with every one

Well its a fact says John Wyse And theres the man now thatll tell you all about it Martin Cunningham

Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton pensioner out of the collector generals an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the kings expense

Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys

Ho varlet cried he who by his mien seemed the leader of the party Saucy knave To us

So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice

Mine host came forth at the summons girding him with his tabard

Give you good den my masters said he with an obsequious bow

Bestir thyself sirrah cried he who had knocked Look to our steeds And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it

Lackaday good masters said the host my poor house has but a bare larder I know not what to offer your lordships

How now fellow cried the second of the party a man of pleasant countenance So servest thou the kings messengers master Taptun

An instantaneous change overspread the landlords visage

Cry you mercy gentlemen he said humbly An you be the kings messengers God shield His Majesty you shall not want for aught The kings friends God bless His Majesty shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me

Then about cried the traveller who had not spoken a lusty trencherman by his aspect Hast aught to give us

Mine host bowed again as he made answer

What say you good masters to a squab pigeon pasty some collops of venison a saddle of veal widgeon with crisp hogs bacon a boars head with pistachios a bason of jolly custard a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish

Gadzooks cried the last speaker That likes me well Pistachios

Aha cried he of the pleasant countenance A poor house and a bare larder quotha Tis a merry rogue

So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom

Where is he says Lenehan Defrauding widows and orphans

Isnt that a fact says John Wyse what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein

Thats so says Martin Or so they allege

Who made those allegations says Alf

I says Joe Im the alligator

And after all says John Wyse why cant a jew love his country like the next fellow

Why not says J J when hes quite sure which country it is

Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he says Ned Or who is he No offence Crofton

Who is Junius says J J

We dont want him says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian

Hes a perverted jew says Martin from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system We know that in the castle

Isnt he a cousin of Bloom the dentist says Jack Power

Not at all says Martin Only namesakes His name was Virag the fathers name that poisoned himself He changed it by deedpoll the father did

Thats the new Messiah for Ireland says the citizen Island of saints and sages

Well theyre still waiting for their redeemer says Martin For that matter so are we

Yes says J J and every male thats born they think it may be their Messiah And every jew is in a tall state of excitement I believe till he knows if hes a father or a mother

Expecting every moment will be his next says Lenehan

O by God says Ned you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neaves food six weeks before the wife was delivered

En ventre sa mre says J J

Do you call that a man says the citizen

I wonder did he ever put it out of sight says Joe

Well there were two children born anyhow says Jack Power

And who does he suspect says the citizen

Gob theres many a true word spoken in jest One of those mixed middlings he is Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses Do you know what Im telling you Itd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea Justifiable homicide so it would Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man Give us your blessing Not as much as would blind your eye

Charity to the neighbour says Martin But where is he We cant wait

A wolf in sheeps clothing says the citizen Thats what he is Virag from Hungary Ahasuerus I call him Cursed by God

Have you time for a brief libation Martin says Ned

Only one says Martin We must be quick J J and S

You Jack Crofton Three half ones Terry

Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us says the citizen after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores

Well says Martin rapping for his glass God bless all here is my prayer

Amen says the citizen

And Im sure He will says Joe

Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini

Qui fecit clum et terram

Dominus vobiscum

Et cum spiritu tuo

And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed

Deus cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et anim tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum

And so say all of us says Jack

Thousand a year Lambert says Crofton or Crawford

Right says Ned taking up his John Jameson And butter for fish

I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry

I was just round at the courthouse says he looking for you I hope Im not

No says Martin were ready

Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver Mean bloody scut Stand us a drink itself Devil a sweet fear Theres a jew for you All for number one Cute as a shithouse rat Hundred to five

Dont tell anyone says the citizen

Beg your pardon says he

Come on boys says Martin seeing it was looking blue Come along now

Dont tell anyone says the citizen letting a bawl out of him Its a secret

And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl

Bye bye all says Martin

And he got them out as quick as he could Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car

Off with you says Martin to the jarvey

The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set the spinnaker to larboard A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and clinging to the sides of the noble bark they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair Even so did they come and set them those willing nymphs the undying sisters And they laughed sporting in a circle of their foam and the bark clave the waves

But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door puffing and blowing with the dropsy and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him bell book and candle in Irish spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him

Let me alone says he

And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him

Three cheers for Israel

Arrah sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ sake and dont be making a public exhibition of yourself Jesus theres always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing Gob itd turn the porter sour in your guts so it would

And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew jew jew and a slut shouts out of her

Eh mister Your fly is open mister

And says he

Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew Your God

He had no father says Martin Thatll do now Drive ahead

Whose God says the citizen

Well his uncle was a jew says he Your God was a jew Christ was a jew like me

Gob the citizen made a plunge back into the shop

By Jesus says he Ill brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name By Jesus Ill crucify him so I will Give us that biscuitbox here

Stop Stop says Joe

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasgos uram Lipti Virag late of Messrs Alexander Thoms printers to His Majesty on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of SzzharminczbrojgulysDuguls Meadow of Murmuring Waters The ceremony which went off with great clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum the work of Irish artists was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament a work which reflects every credit on the makers Messrs Jacob agus Jacob The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come Back to Erin followed immediately by Rakczsys March Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth Three Rock Mountain Sugarloaf Bray Head the mountains of Mourne the Galtees the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks the Nagles and the Bograghs the Connemara hills the reeks of MGillicuddy Slieve Aughty Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom Amid cheers that rent the welkin responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while as it proceeded down the river escorted by a flotilla of barges the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light Visszontltsra kedvs bartom Visszontltsra Gone but not forgotten

Gob the devil wouldnt stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig as good as any bloody play in the Queens royal theatre

Where is he till I murder him

And Ned and J J paralysed with the laughing

Bloody wars says I Ill be in for the last gospel

But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nags head round the other way and off with him

Hold on citizen says Joe Stop

Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or hed have left him for dead Gob he near sent it into the county Longford The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street

The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks all of the fifth grade of Mercallis scale and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534 the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inns Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres two roods and one square pole or perch All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials crest coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giants causeway the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst The work of salvage removal of dbris human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son 159 Great Brunswick street and Messrs T and C Martin 77 78 79 and 80 North Wall assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwalls light infantry under the general supervision of H R H rear admiral the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson K G K P K T P C K C B M P J P M B D S O S O D M F H M R I A B L Mus Doc P L G F T C D F R U I F R C P I and F R C S I

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff Gob if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll hed remember the gold cup he would so but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses What O Jesus he did And he let a volley of oaths after him

Did I kill him says he or what

And he shouting to the bloody dog

After him Garry After him boy

And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb Hundred to five Jesus he took the value of it out of him I promise you

When lo there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven And they beheld Him in the chariot clothed upon in the glory of the brightness having raiment as of the sun fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him And there came a voice out of heaven calling Elijah Elijah And He answered with a main cry Abba Adonai And they beheld Him even Him ben Bloom Elijah amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoes in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel
