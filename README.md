# üìú NLP for Legislative Drafting
The NLP for Legislative Drafting application is a full stack Microsoft Word Add-in that simplifies the process of legislative drafting. It allows users to search for, summarize, and extract legal citations and effective dates from a vast repository of American laws. It accomplishes this through the use of several advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, including the OpenAI API, as well as a specifically trained Hugging Face NLP model. This project is a collaboration between Trinity College Dublin's School of Computer Science and Statistics and Propylon, a Dublin-based company specializing in software solutions for the legal sector.
